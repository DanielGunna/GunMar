[Not, Coming, to, a, Theater, Near, You, Home, Features, Reviews, Calendar, Stills, Site, Information, Search, Home, Features, The, End, In, its, nascent, years, NotComing.com, was, a, decided, acolyte, to, the, genre, writing, of, Danny, Peary, (Cult, Movies, and, its, two, sequels,, as, well, as, Guide, for, the, Film, Fanatic),, Michael, Weldon, (The, Psychotronic, Encyclopedia),, and, Video, Watchdog., But, there, was, already, good, company, on, the, web:, Filmref.com,, MovieMartyr.com,, GreenCine, Daily,, Outlaw, Vern,, and, Mike, D’Angelo’s, capsule, reviews,, to, name, but, a, few., Consequently,, film, writing, saw, a, renaissance,, christening, an, era, in, which, criticism, became, more, available, and, democratized, than, it, had, ever, been, before., Now, it, seems, anyone, with, the, wherewithal, to, share, the, findings, of, her, own, cinematic, excursions, has, the, ability, to, do, so, quickly, and, accessibly., This, all, began, over, fifteen, years, ago—long, enough, for, films, that, have, come, in, our, tenure, to, have, merited, reconsideration., When, we, began, we, intended, to, shed, light, on, cinema’s, perimeters, and, make, aware, our, readers, of, its, great, extent., And, now, this, extent, is, as, accessible, as, it, has, ever, been., This, is, a, great, privilege, for, exploratory, cineastes., But, it, diminishes, the, potency, of, our, findings,, and, it, is, with, this, awareness, that, I, announce, that, we, are, ceasing, publication., Feature, by:, Rumsey, Taylor, Posted, on:, 14, May, 2014, Reviews, Vernon,, Florida, Vernon,, Florida, is, a, portrait, of, America’s, fringes,, a, document, of, a, place, that, seems, to, have, remained, endearingly, beholden, to, archaic, mores., This, is, a, romantic, pretense,, however,, and, those, who, admire, the, film, will, almost, certainly, find, the, real-life, Vernon, to, be, far, more, mundane, and, less, folksy,, but, its, history, uncharacteristically, perverse, and, violent., By:, Rumsey, Taylor, On:, 9, June, 2014, Reviews, Burn, Hollywood, Burn, One, of, the, most, spectacular, flops, in, history,, the, film, effectively, ended, the, careers, of, Joe, Eszterhas, and, Arthur, Hiller,, and, it, also, marked, the, end, of, its, film, studio,, Cinergi, Pictures., It’s, as, though, the, film, succeeds, at, antagonizing, those, whom, it, satarizes,, and, in, result, it, is, so, noxious, that, few, have, opted, to, encounter, it., By:, David, Carter, On:, 4, June, 2014, Reviews, Pitfall, Amid, stark, mountains, of, black, coal, and, decrepit, mining, towns,, traitors,, backstabbers,, and, murderers, carry, out, their, soulless, machinations., For, those, in, power,, selfishness, and, greed, are, the, order, of, the, day,, and, for, the, workingman,, a, bitter, life, of, endless, toil, is, rewarded, only, with, a, bitter, afterlife, of, endless, torment., And, yet,, beneath, the, caustic, social, commentary, that, dominates, the, film, lies, an, almost, imperceptible, championing, of, the, incorruptibility, of, the, human, spirit,, injecting, this, otherwise, bleak, forecast, for, humanity, with, a, modicum, of, hope., By:, Thomas, Scalzo, On:, 3, June, 2014, Reviews, The, Adventures, of, Gerard, Jerzy, Skolimowski’s, films, of, the, sixties, –, edgy,, innovative,, and, challenging, –, were, so, clearly, part, of, the, collective, new, wave, sweeping, national, cinemas, of, the, day, that, the, choice, of, The, Adventures, of, Gerard, as, the, first, film, of, his, international, career, seems, doubly, perplexing;, it, offers, almost, no, connections, with, the, work, that, went, before., By:, Ian, Johnston, On:, 2, June, 2014, Reviews, Ferdydurke, Ferdydurke, is, the, film, that, led, to, Jerzy, Skolimowski’s, seventeen-year, silence, as, a, director—a, disappointed, Skolimowski, withdrew, to, his, house, in, Malibu, and, devoted, himself, to, painting, and, the, occasional, acting, role, (Mars, Attacks!,, Eastern, Promises., You, could, say, the, film, is, doubly, obscure:, adapted, from, a, Polish, novel, that, remains, untranslated, in, the, West,, and, only, seen, in, Poland,, France, and, Latin, America., By:, Ian, Johnston, On:, 23, May, 2014, Reviews, The, Hypothesis, of, the, Stolen, Painting, The, information, the, characters, pursue, is, of, no, tangible, value,, and, yet, they, frantically, search, for, the, truth,, overwhelmed, simply, by, their, desire, to, know, the, answers, denied, them., Ruiz, denies, giving, the, audience, a, firm, context, for, the, film’s, events,, relying, solely, on, their, mutual, curiosity, with, a, mystery, about, which, they, know, nothing., By:, David, Carter, On:, 22, May, 2014, Stills, View, Today’s, Still, View, Recent, Stills, Go, to,
