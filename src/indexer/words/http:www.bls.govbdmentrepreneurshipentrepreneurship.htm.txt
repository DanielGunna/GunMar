SEARCH, BDM, Entrepreneurship, and, the, U.S., Economy, Entrepreneurship, plays, a, vital, role, in, the, growth, of, the, U.S., economy., As, the, primary, source, for, information, on, the, nation’s, labor, market,, the, U.S., Bureau, of, Labor, Statistics, (BLS), collects, data, on, new, businesses, and, job, creation., The, following, highlights, from, data, series, produced, by, BLS, Business, Employment, Dynamics, (BED), program, provide, insight, on, the, contribution, of, young, and, small, businesses, to, the, overall, number, of, businesses, and, jobs, in, the, economy., Business, establishment, age, The, BED, data, series, on, age, of, establishment, tracks, cohorts, of, new, business, establishments, “born”, in, the, same, year, and, reports, on, their, associated, employment., The, number, of, new, business, establishments, (establishments, that, are, less, than, 1, year, old, in, any, given, year), tends, to, rise, and, fall, with, the, business, cycle, of, the, overall, economy, (see, chart, 1)., (Data, by, age, are, not, available, prior, to, 1994.), [Chart, data], The, number, of, jobs, created, by, establishments, less, than, 1, year, old, has, decreased, from, 4.1, million, in, 1994,, when, this, series, began,, to, 3, million, in, 2015., (See, chart, 2.), This, trend, combined, with, that, of, fewer, new, establishments, overall, indicates, that, the, number, of, new, jobs, in, each, new, establishment, is, declining., [Chart, data], Establishment, survival, New, business, establishments, make, an, important, contribution, to, the, economy;, however,, it, is, inevitable, that, some, of, these, establishments, will, eventually, fail., The, BED, age, series, tracks, cohorts, of, new, business, establishments, to, measure, how, many, survive, from, year, to, year., (For, a, full, listing,, see, www.bls.gov/bdm/us_age_naics_00_table7.txt), Survival, rates, follow, a, similar, path,, regardless, of, the, birth, year,, as, seen, in, chart, 3,, which, compares, birth, cohorts, from, different, years., [Chart, data], Survival, rates, for, establishments, vary, by, industry., The, health, care, and, social, assistance, industry,, for, example,, consistently, ranks, among, the, industries, with, the, highest, survival, rates, over, time,, while, construction, ranks, among, the, lowest., (See, chart, 4.), [Chart, data], Establishment, births, and, deaths, In, addition, to, annual, birth, cohorts, identified, by, age,, BLS, also, publishes, BED, data, on, business, births, and, deaths, on, a, quarterly, basis., The, birth, and, death, data, series, is, the, most, timely, source, of, data, available, on, new, private, sector, business, establishments, in, the, United, States., As, shown, in, chart, 5,, the, period, from, 1993, to, 2006, was, marked, by, an, increase, in, the, number, of, births, and, deaths,, indicating, a, higher, amount, of, business, “churn”—that, is,, new, business, establishments, entered, and, old, establishments, exited, the, economy, in, greater, numbers., After, the, most, recent, recession, began, in, December, 2007,, establishment, births, experienced, the, steepest, decline, in, the, history, of, the, series., The, downward, trend, reversed, in, early, 2010, and, establishment, births, have, since, returned, to, pre-recession, levels., [Chart, data], The, number, of, jobs, created, from, establishment, births, peaked, in, the, late, 1990s, and, has, experienced, an, overall, decline, since, then., The, decrease, in, birth-related, employment, during, the, latest, recession, is, the, largest, in, the, history, of, the, series,, followed, closely, by, the, period, of, “jobless, recovery”, after, the, 2001, recession., [Chart, data], Firm, Size, Small, businesses, are, typically, the, entry, point, for, entrepreneurs, as, they, develop, ideas, and, build, a, customer, base, before, deciding, whether, to, expand., Of, the, nine, size, classes, in, the, BED, series,, the, six, smallest, (249, employees, or, smaller), have, seen, their, shares, of, private, sector, employment, decrease, since, the, early, 1990s,, while, the, three, largest, size, classes, (250, or, more, employees), have, seen, their, shares, of, total, employment, increase., (See, chart, 7.), [Chart, data], More, information, and, data, can, be, found, on, the, BED, page, of,
