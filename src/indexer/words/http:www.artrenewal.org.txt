its, size., In, fact,, many, masterpieces, before, the, 19th, century, are, of, small, sizes,, including, the, works, of, Vermeer,, Alma-Tadema, and, Fortuny., In, my, opinion,, the, reason, that, the, audience, adores, this, small, size, painting, of, mine,, apart, from, the, beauty, and, technique,, lies, another, factor., Nowadays, we, live, in, a, digital, age, where, largeness, can, be, overwhelming, and, can, abuse, the, visual, senses., Smallness, is, a, sort, of, concentration., For, my, models,, I, usually, give, them, some, tips, about, my, idea, instead, of, restricting, them., When, they, pose,, I, take, photos, of, every, moment, and, then, select, the, one, I, am, satisfied, with, for, sketching, the, general, composition., Finally,, I, create, the, oil, painting, from, the, live, model,, based, on, the, sketch., I, enjoy, using, copper, plate, as, the, base, which, I, have, done, with, this, work,, though, I, do, work, on, linen, as, well., I, feel, that, the, copper, makes, the, color, of, the, painting, very, soft, and, gentle,, which, is, what, I, desired, for, this, work., In, front, of, a, work, of, visual, art,, everyone, is, equal., No, matter, what, the, artwork, presents,, idealistic,, aesthetic,, classic,, modern, or, contemporary,, the, vison, sense, itself, does, not, tell, lies., It, is, utilitarian, minds, that, make, up, the, lies, to,

in, the, painting, is, the, only, one, who, can, see, her, true, self., The, looming, shadow, of, the, man, in, the, background, is, a, literal, visualization, of, feeling, over-shadowed, by, male,

of, his, adult, life, creating, music, and, playing, the, guitar,, I, naturally, employ, the, same, sort, of, thought, processes, when, working, on, my, drawings, and, paintings., I, particularly, enjoy, drawing, with, charcoal., In, the, same, way, a, music, composer, can, put, down, some, notes,, listen, and, decide, what, is, worth, keeping,, so, it, can, be, with, this, medium., Nothing, needs, to, be, final, as, you, create, and, build, up, your, composition, as, a, whole., I, work, on, aluminum, panels, that, I, prime, with, a, mixture, of, neutral, grey, gesso, and, pumice, stone., This, provides, me, with, a, very, rigid, and, textured, surface, which, can, hold, a, lot, of, medium., I, like, to, be, able, to, really, push, the, charcoal, into, the, fine, pores, and, leave, nothing, too, loose, or, chalky, on, the, finished, surface., The, end, result, is, a, well, fixed, drawing, on, a, very, stable, substrate., I, tend, to, keep, my, narrative, as, simple, as,

of, flesh., Clutching, his, jaw,, searching, for, the, edge,, he, desperately, tries, to, peel, it, off., Perhaps, there, will, always, be, a, mask, obscuring, the, true, face, of, reality.”, –,
