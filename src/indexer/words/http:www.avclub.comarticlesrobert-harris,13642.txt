Harris, By, Scott, Tobias, Mar, 1,, 2000, 3:00, PM, With, rapid, fading, and, poorly, maintained, archives, leaving, many, films,, even, acknowledged, masterpieces,, in, danger, of, being, lost, to, history,, Robert, A., Harris, resides, at, the, forefront, of, a, movement, to, reconstruct, and, restore, American, classics, for, future, generations., A, former, producer, whose, credits, include, The, Grifters,, Harris, cut, his, teeth, aiding, Kevin, Brownlow, in, reviving, Abel, Gance's, 1927, silent, opus, Napoleon., He, then, undertook, a, massive, two-year, project, to, bring, an, uncut, version, of, Lawrence, Of, Arabia, to, the, screen, in, its, original, 70mm, format,, a, labor, of, love, that, was, widely, hailed, as, a, landmark, in, film, restoration., Shortly, thereafter,, Harris, teamed, up, with, longtime, partner, James, C., Katz,, and, together,, they've, consistently, turned, their, painstaking, efforts, into, major, moviegoing, events,, specializing, in, such, gorgeous, large-format, restorations, as, Spartacus,, My, Fair, Lady,, and, Vertigo., Their, latest, reissue,, Alfred, Hitchcock's, Rear, Window,, took, advantage, of, Technicolor's, new, dye-transfer, process,, which, allows, many, luminous, color, prints, to, be, duplicated, without, damaging, the, preserved, negative., Harris, recently, spoke, to, The, Onion, A.V., Club, about, his, work., The, Onion:, How, did, you, learn, your, craft?, Robert, Harris:, When, I, was, a, kid,, my, father, was, an, importer, of, Zeiss, cameras, and, lenses, and, Astro, lenses,, which, were, German, telephotos,, so, I, grew, up, with, cameras, and, photographystill, and, motion, picture., I, had, my, own, darkroom, when, I, was, a, kid,, and, I, was, processing, black-and-white, film, and, then, color, film,, so, I, got, to, know, quite, a, bit, about, emulsions., And,, at, the, same, time,, I, loved, movies., Of, course,, we, didn't, have, videotape, back, then,, but, we, had, a, 16mm, projector., One, of, [my, father's], friends, was, head, of, a, company, called, Seven, Arts,, and, they, had, all, the, pre-1949, Warner, Brothers, films,, the, Monogram, films, and, things, of, that, sort, for, TV., So, my, parents, would, go, to, Europe, for, a, couple, of, weeks,, and, before, they, went,, we, would, have, cartons, and, cartons, and, cartons, of, 16mm, films, delivered., And, I, would, do, my, homework, every, night,, then, load, up, the, projector, and, watch, old, movies., So, I, really, gained, an, education, and, a, respect, for, film., Also,, in, New, York,, we, had, something, on, TV, called, "Million, Dollar, Movie,", which, would, enable, you, to, watch, stuff, like, King, Kong, or, Yankee, Doodle, Dandy, eight, times, a, day., I, grew, up, on, Universal, horror, movies., So, I, just, loved, films,, and, I'm, a, bit, of, perfectionist,, so, I, like, to, see, things, properly., My, favorite, film, was, always, Lawrence, Of, Arabia, and,, although, I, had, seen, it, in, 70mm, when, it, first, came, out,, it, had, already, been, shorn, of, 20, minutes, and, I, didn't, know, it., So, that's, how, I, got, into, [restoring], Lawrence., I, went, to, people, I, knew, at, Columbia, and, told, them, I'd, like, to, reconstruct, and, restore, this, film., This, was, after, working, with, Kevin, Brownlow, on, Napoleon., O:, The, word, "painstaking", is, invariably, used, to, describe, what, you, do., Is, that, an, accurate, term?, RH:, It, is, extremely, accurate., I, had, hair, before, I, started, doing, this., It's, really,, really, difficult., You, can't, do, it, by, the, seat, of, your, pants., You, only, get, one, opportunity, to, work, with, the, film, elements;, they, can, be, screwed, up, really, easily,, so, you, can't, take, any, chances., You've, got, to, do, your, research., Before, you, find, out, where, you're, going,, you, have, to, find, out, where, you've, been., So,, number, one,, you, have, to, know, what, the, film, looked, like, originallyor, was, supposed, to, look, like, originally., You've, got, to, go, through, all, the, production, records, to, see, how, the, film, was, made., And, only, then, can, you, start, to, try, and, fix, it., And, when, you, do, that,, you, have, to, look, at, it, on, a, shot-by-shot, and, frame-by-frame, basis, to, see, what, the, problems, are, and, where, the, problems, are,, and, then, you, begin, to, fix, them., And, there's, no, single, answer, how, to, do, that., Every, restoration, is, different,, which, is, what, makes, it, interesting., O:, With, so, many, films, deteriorating,, how, do, you, decide, which, ones, to, restore?, RH:, [James, Katz, and, I], restore, the, ones, that, we, like,, generally,, unless, someone, wants, to, come, up, and, offer, us, ridiculous, amounts, of, money, to, do, it., But, it, takes, so, much, time,, and, it, is, so, painstaking..., There's, blood, on, these, things., There's, a, lot, of, sweat,, there's, a, lot, of, blood,, there's, a, lot, of, angst,, and, it's, not, worth, spending, your, life, saving, something, if, you, don't, care, about, it., You, have, to, be, passionate, about, it., It's, something, that, you, can't, just, be, paid, to, do,, because, that, doesn't, work., O:, Are, there, any, other, classics, you, can, think, of, that, are, in, dire, need, of, attention?, RH:, Yeah., O:, Any, titles, come, to, mind?, RH:, A, few., Would, you, like, to, hear, them?, O:, Sure., RH:, How, about, The, Alamo?, The, Godfather..., O:, The, Godfather?, Really?, RH:, The, Godfather, is, a, mess., The, Godfather, is, as, bad, as, Rear, Window., O:, Does, it, have, to, do, with, the, film, stocks, of, that, particular, period, not, being, as, durable?, RH:, It's, the, period, and, the, way, they're, handled,, and, The, Godfather, was, butchered, by, the, laboratories., It, was, handled, horribly,, like, a, piece, of, garbage., O:, They, didn't, do, anything, with, this, recent, re-release?, RH:, It, was, horrible., They, called, it, a, restoration., They, spent, half, a, million, dollars., This, is, one, of, the, things, that, has, come, back, to, haunt, us,, because, once, a, [restoration], is, done,, it, should, be, done, and, you, assume, that, it, is, done., But, The, Godfather, wasn't, restored., North, By, Northwest, has, not, been, restored., Dr., Zhivago, has, been, restored,, but, more, damage, was, done, than, help., You, have, to, know, what, you're, doing,, and, it, can't, be, done, by, bean, counters., O:, Are, there, not, adequate, apprenticeships, in, place, for, people, to, learn, how, to, do, it, correctly?, RH:, There, are,, but, the, wrong, people, are, being, asked, to, do, it., There, are, some, wonderful, apprenticeships, out, there., We, hire, people, when, we, do, a, film,, generally., There's, the, Jeffrey, Selznick, School, Of, Film, Restoration, And, Preservation, at, George, Eastmanhouse, in, Rochester., UCLA, has, one., There's, a, film-restoration, program, at, East, Langley, University., So, people, can, learn, and, it, can, be, done,, but, what's, happening, is, that, the, wrong, decisions, are, being, made, on, a, corporate, level., So, when, you, try, to, restore, a, film, like, Zhivago, for, $120,000, and, you, come, out, with, a, piece, of, garbage,, that, speaks, more, of, Warner, Brothers, and, their, inability, to, run, and, control, their, library., And, I, think, it, speaks, of, incompetent, management., Same, thing, with, Gone, With, The, Wind., Incompetent, management., O:, So, this, is, an, industry-wide, problem,, with, studios, not, being, able, to, preserve, and, maintain, their, archives., RH:, It, pretty, much, is., Universal, is, actually, pretty, good., MGMthe, new, MGM,, let, us, get, our, terms, straighthas, a, new, guy, in, there, who's, trying, very, hard,, and, he's, got, a, real, mess, on, his, hands., Disney, just, shut, down, their, restoration, program,, so, they, don't, even, have, one., The, company's, in, financial, straits,, I, guess,, because, Michael, Eisner, probably, needs, to, get, his, salary., So, they've, literally, shut, down, their, restoration-and-preservation, department., O:, Could, you, explain, briefly, what, happened, with, these, Paramount, Hitchcock, films, before, they, were, picked, up, by, Universal?, RH:, Yes., The, rights, for, five, filmsRope,, The, Trouble, With, Harry,, The, Man, Who, Knew, Too, Much,, Rear, Window,, and, Vertigoreverted, to, Hitchcock, in, 1967., Hitchcock, called, someone, and, said,, "I've, got, hundreds, and, hundreds, of, cartons., This, is, going, to, cost, money,, and, I, can't, fit, it, in, the, freezer, because, I'm, not, going, to, take, the, ice, cream, out., What, do, I, do, with, it?", And, he, was, misinformed., Hitchcock,, whose, work, I, love,, was, a, superb, master, craftsman, when, it, came, to, filmmaking, and, a, really, lousy, archivist., Basically,, he, got, some, really, bad, advice., And, that, advice, was,, "Take, your, camera, negatives,, your, black-and-white, separation, masters, (which, protect, the, negatives),, a, 16mm, and, a, 35mm, soundtrack, negative, (which, is, used, for, making, prints),, and, junk, everything, else, worldwide.", What, this, means, is, that, they, junked, all, of, the, original, audio, stems, (music,, effects,, dialogue),, they, junked, the, three-stripe, mag, master, (which, included, music,, effects,, and, dialogue, on, separate, stripes, on, a, single, 35mm, film),, they, junked, the, monaural, composite, mag, master,, they, junked, all, the, foreign, elements,, they, junked, all, the, advertising, elements, and, trailers,, they, junked, all, the, effects, material,, and, they, junked, all, the, main, title, backgrounds, and, main, titles,, except, for, the, composite, dupes., Then, they, took, [what, they, kept], and, stored, it, in, a, non-air-conditioned,, unheated, warehouse, in, Los, Angeles,, where, it, stayed, from, 1967, to, 1983,, when, Universal, got, it., Universal's, vaults,, by, the, way,, are, superb:, 34,, 25%, humidity,, right, on, target., But, by, the, time, they, got, [the, films],, they, were, faded., They, were, gone., O:, What, were, some, of, the, most, daunting, challenges, posed, by, the, Rear, Window, restoration?, RH:, Picture, and, sound., O:, So, everything., RH:, Everything., There, was, nothing, that, was, good., There, was, no, surviving, original, sound, material, whatsoever,, only, used, 35mm, tracks., We, found, that, when, they, made, the, optical, soundtrack, negative, in, 1954which, was, made, for, the, manufacturing, of, all, the, printsit, had, been, run, 389, times, along, with, camera, negative, in, '54., So, they, were, both, worn, out,, but, the, [soundtrack], negative, had, been, made, defectively., You've, obviously, seen, a, piece, of, film, at, some, point?, O:, I, was, a, projectionist, for, many, years., RH:, So, you've, seen, a, lot, of, film., The, Rear, Window, track, negative, was, a, bi-polar, variable-density, track..., you, know,, two, soundtrack, impulses., The, outboard, impulse, was, fine., The, inboard, impulsethe, one, next, to, the, perforationswas, out, of, focus, and, not, properly, exposed., So, all, we, had, to, work, with, was, a, single, impulse, cutting, the, quality, of, the, sound, down, in, half,, plus, all, the, splices,, all, the, dirt,, and, all, the, wear, built, into, the, optical, track., We, had, to, go, in, and, digitize, everything,, take, different, pieces, of, track, from, different, prints, and, do, what, we, could, to, piece, the, track, back, together., We, did, find, the, original, music,, which, was, all, mono,, and, that's, been, preserved., There, was, no, reason, to, go, stereo, [for, the, reissue],, because, the, music, itself, was, recorded, mono., That's, why, we, didn't, do, what, we, did, with, Vertigo., O:, With, Vertigo,, you, completely, overhauled, the, foley, work,, correct?, RH:, We, had, to,, yeah., All, the, foley, and, the, effects, were, totally, redone., We, had, the, same, problem, with, the, Vertigo, track, [as, we, did, with, the, Rear, Window, track]., All, that, survived, were, used, 35mm, prints., We, had, no, mag, material,, except, for, the, music,, which, we, found, in, the, Paramount, vaults., These, weren't, even, the, cut, music, takes;, these, were, the, original, floor, recordings, that, we, found, in, three-track, stereo., So,, once, we, found, those, and, they, sounded, so, extraordinary,, we, discussed, it, with, a, number, of, critics, we, respect, and, Herbert, Coleman,, who, was, Hitchcock's, producer,, and, Pat, Hitchcock, [the, director's, daughter],, and, a, few, other, people., We, said,, "What, do, we, do?, Do, we, try, and, make, the, mono, track,, which, is, dirty, and, has, holes, in, it,, sound, as, good, as, we, can, make, it, sound?, Or, do, we, take, the, original, music,, which, is, stereo, and, which, many, people, feel, is, [composer], Bernard, Herrman's, finest, work,, and, redo, the, tracks?", And, everyone,, to, an, individual,, said,, "We, want, to, hear, it, in, stereo.", The, caveat,, of, course,, was, that, we, would, have, to, re-foley, and, re-effect, the, entire, picture., O:, That, must, have, been, a, fearful, thing, to, do., RH:, Not, really,, because, we, preserved, what, existed., Actually,, on, the, DVD,, we, wanted, the, studio, to, put, what, was, left, of, the, original, mono, track, optical, on, one, track, and, run, the, stereo, on, the, other., But, they, didn't, want, to, do, that,, because, it, wasn't, on, the, laserdisc., Anyway,, the, music, sounded, so, extraordinary, and, the, recordings, were, so, well, done,, but, there, were, problems., Put, yourself, back, in, 1958., You're, putting, film, on, a, projector., How, old, do, you, think, that, projector, was, in, 1958?, Where, do, you, think, it, came, from?, It's, probably, out, of, the, mid-'30s,, with, a, tube, sound, system, and, speakers, out, of, the, '30s., So, all, of, the, warts, that, are, in, that, soundtrack, would, not, come, through, on, the, speakers,, which, smooth, everything, outlop, off, the, high, end,, lop, off, the, low, end., But, if, you, take, that, track, and, you, run, it, on, a, new, system, today,, you, hear, everything,, including, lots, of, holes, where, they, would, just, cut, in, dead, filmno, room, tone,, nothing., So, when, we, would, add, a, foghorn,, a, couple, of, birds, at, the, bridge,, some, wind, rustling, through, the, tower, at, the, end, of, the, film..., Those, were, to, cover, holes., We, had, no, room, tone., We, had, to, create, everything., O:, On, Rear, Window,, what, sort, of, detective, work, did, you, have, to, do, in, order, to, put, it, together, properly?, RH:, Well,, we, didn't, have, a, surviving, print, with, the, right, color., Most, of, the, information, that, we, got, relative, to, color, came, from, Herbie, Coleman,, who, produced, the, film., He, was, there, with, Hitchcock, starting, with, Rear, Window, and, going, all, the, way, through, for, lots, of, films., We, would, go, through, things, if, we, could, find, them., We, found, Georgine, Darcy's, shorts;, she, played, Miss, Torso, [the, ballet, dancer]., She, brought, them, into, the, office, one, day, and, they, were, faded,, but, if, you, fold, down, the, cuffs,, you, have, the, color., And, that's, what, you, go, for., Flesh, tones, you, can, maneuver, a, little, bit,, but, what, is, right?, So, you, try, to, make, it, as, right, as, possible., Even, when, we, had, footage, from, the, original, negative,, it, was, very, faded,, and, we, had, to, bring, it, back, as, well, as, we, possibly, could, and, work, with, the, [Technicolor], dye-transfer, process., O:, This, is, one, of, the, first, restorations, to, use, that, process,, right?, RH:, We, feel, this, is, the, first, restoration, to, use, it, successfully, and, properly., It, was, used, on, Gone, With, The, Wind,, but, you, couldn't, focus, it,, which, was, a, minor, problem., [Laughs.], O:, What, did, you, think, of, the, Gone, With, The, Wind, restoration?, RH:, Let's, change, the, subject., O:, Oh,, that, good?, RH:, I, watched, two, reels, and, left, because, I, had, a, headache., O:, Colors, were, too, pronounced?, RH:, Colors, were, wrong,, and, they, couldn't, focus,, and, it, was, out, of, registration,, and, it, was, contrast-y., Beyond, that,, it, was, beautiful., It's, a, lovely, film., O:, What, sort, of, discoveries, do, you, make, about, a, film, when, you, look, at, it, that, closely?, RH:, Well,, how, badly, it, cuts, together, when, they, change, the, lighting, and, change, the, camera, angleshow, things, don't, match., Remember,, this, is, very, early, Eastmancolor,, and, it, might, have, looked, better, in, 1953, and, '54,, but, now, it's, all, faded., Part, of, the, trick, is, making, it, all, look, like, it, cuts, together, and, making, a, new, cohesive, film., O:, What, are, your, thoughts, on, the, prospect, of, digital, projection?, RH:, I, don't, think, it's, viable, at, the, moment., O:, But, is, it, a, system, that, you, approve, or, disapprove, of?, RH:, I, don't, think, it's, up, to, me, to, approve, or, disapprove., I, think, the, tests, people, have, been, seeing, don't, tell, the, truth., There's, a, lot, of, smoke, and, mirrors., Because, when, you, look, at, a, picture, like, the, new, Star, Wars, or, Toy, Story,, these, are, films, in, which, the, effects, were, done, at, 2K,, which, is, half-resolution,, and, the, audience, doesn't, know, it,, so, you're, looking, at, effects, that, are, low-resolution., They, then, take, all, the, production, photography, for, the, film,, the, cut, camera, negative,, and, they, input, that, and, output, it, digitally,, at, a, lower, resolution., That's, how, they, make, a, dupe, negative., So, you're, looking, at, a, lower-resolution-than-normal, 35mm, print, versus, a, lower-resolution-than-normal, digital, file., O:, Now,, a, digital, image, can't, approximate, the, resolution, that, film, can, achieve,, correct?, RH:, It, can, get, close., It, depends, what, you're, trying, to, do,, and, it's, certainly, going, to, get, better, as, time, goes, on., If, you, want, to, see, great, projection,, look, into, a, system, called, Maxivision48., [MaxiVision48, places, a, large, image, on, regular, 35mm, film,, then, runs, it, twice, as, fast,, creating, a, clearer, and, sharper, image., ed.], O:, I, was, going, to, ask, you, about, that., You've, seen, a, demonstration?, What's, it, like?, RH:, Superb., Absolutely, superb., And, projectors, can, be, retrofitted, to, accommodate, the, system., The, system, works, beautifully,, and, it, yields, an, image, that's, much, sharper, than, what, we're, seeing, today., Basically,, put, your, digital, output, next, to, Maxivision, and, there's, a, big, difference., O:, But, it, seems, to, be, one, of, those, situations, where, you've, got, the, industry, and, a, lot, of, money, behind, digital, projection,, but, no, one, to, stand, behind, a, perhaps, superior, system., RH:, Well,, look, at, the, cost, of, digital, projection., What, are, we, looking, at,, $150,000, for, a, projector?, I, don't, think, the, mom-and-pop, theaters, will, ever, have, digital, projection,, because, if, they, do, have, it,, why, do, people, need, to, go, to, the, theaters?, You, can, actually, have, a, much, more, satisfying, experience, today, watching, most, movies, at, home., At, a, theater,, you, have, somebody, on, your, left, getting, a, cell-phone, call,, you've, got, somebody, behind, you, translating, dialogue, to, friends, in, another, language..., I, mean,, my, movie-going, experiences, have, not, been, terribly, positive, in, the, last, couple, of, years., O:, But, it, seems, like, the, cost, of, digital, projection, would, go, down,, wouldn't, it?, RH:, I, don't, know., It, depends, on, the, cost, of, the, projectors., O:, Is, there, a, force, behind, Maxivision, that, might, drive, it, ahead?, RH:, Not, yet., Just, people, who, love, films, and, have, seen, the, system, and, think, it's, great., O:, What's, been, so, surprising, to, me, about, digital, projection, is, that, there, hasn't, been, much, of, an, outcry, about, it., People, seem, resigned, to, the, idea, that, this, is, the, future, of, film, projection., RH:, But, who, are, the, people?, Are, these, the, people, who, are, sitting, at, home, watching, Titanic, on, a, pan-and-scan, VHS, tape?, They'd, be, thrilled, to, see, something, on, a, bigger, screen., So, it, depends, on, who, the, people, are., Who, is, the, public?, Is, it, an, uneducated,, unwashed, public, that's, out, there, watching, their, pan-and-scans?, Or, is, it, the, cognoscenti, who, are, watching, their, DVDs?, We're, up, to,, what,, four, million, DVD, players, now?, I, think, the, great, unwashed, are, suddenly, realizing, that, they, can, have, quality, for, $250., I, wasn't, around, when, fire, and, the, wheel, came, in,, but, DVD, is, bang, right, out, of, the, chute., O:, So, with, something, like, digital, projection,, people, would, shrug, and, say,, "I'm, not, seeing, anything, better, here, than, I, could, see, at, home.", RH:, I, don't, think, they, care., They, have, to, care., I, mean,, do, people, know, that, film, is, dye-transfer, Technicolor, rather, than, Eastmancolor?, Do, they, see, that, facial, highlights, are, green?, When, I, go, to, a, theater,, I'm, up, in, the, [projection], booth, half, the, time., If, something, is, out, of, focus,, I'm, in, the, booth., If, it's, not, in, frame,, I'm, in, the, booth., My, wife, doesn't, want, to, go, to, movies, with, me, anymore., I, was, once, at, a, film, and, the, frameline, just, sat, there, and, sat, there., I, went, to, the, usher, and, said,, "Would, you, please, tell, the, projectionist, to, frame, it?", He, said,, "What, do, you, mean?", And, I, said,, "See, on, the, screen,, you, can, see, the, top, of, the, frame, after, the, bottom, of, the, frame, that, we're, looking, at.", Ten, minutes, later,, the, guy, came, back., I, said,, "Did, you, talk, to, him?", And, he, said,, "Yeah.", I, said,, "Well,, [the, frameline], is, still, there.", He, said,, "The, projectionist, told, me, that, you, have, to, understand, that, a, movie, is, strip, of, frames,, the, frameline, separates, those, frames,, and, you, have, to, have, it.", I, said,, "I, know, it's, there,, but, you're, not, supposed, to, see, it.", [Laughs.], When, I, was, about, 17,, I, was, with, a, couple, of, friends, at, a, theater, in, White, Plains,, New, York., We, went, to, see, Hombre,, the, Paul, Newman, film., And, the, guy, was, running, one, reel, sort, of, out, of, focus, and, the, other, reel, way, out, of, focus, and, out, of, frame., I, spoke, to, the, usher, a, couple, of, times,, and, I, finally, said,, "Look,, can, I, talk, to, the, projectionist?", So, I, went, up, [to, the, booth], and, there, was, this, ancient, projectionist,, probably, 130,, 140, years, old., There, he, was,, reading, Playboy,, and, the, usher, said,, "This, young, fellow, would, like, to, talk, to, you.", He, said,, "Oh,, what, the, hell, do, you, want?", I, said,, "Well,, you're, running, Projector, One, out, of, focus, and, you're, running, Projector, Two, out, of, focus, and, out, of, frame.", He, said,, "What, the, fuck, do, you, know?, Here,, you, fix, it, if, you're, such, a, hotshot.", So, he, took, the, projectorthis, is, with, an, audience,, mind, youand, he, throws, it, way, out, of, focus,, he, throws, it, way, out, of, frame, so, the, film, is, clanking, up, and, down,, and, then, releases, the, tension,, so, the, film, is, wobbling, all, over, the, place., He, says,, "Go, ahead,, hotshot,, see, what, you, can, do.", And, he's, cursing, and, there's, no, portal, glass,, so, you've, got, 300, to, 400, people, turning, around, wondering, what, the, hell, is, going, on., So, I, get, the, tension, reasonably, in,, then, I, focus, the, thing,, get, the, frame, in,, reset, the, tension, to, perfection,, and, put, it, in, critical, sharpness., Then, I, hear, my, friends, start, applauding,, "Yo,, way, to, go,, Harris!", And, they, hear, the, guy, screaming,, "Get, out, of, my, fucking, booth, or, I'll, have, you, arrested!", Later,, of, course,, he, changed, over, to, the, other, projector, and, it, was, out, of, focus., Filed, Under:, More, Interview, Previous, Interview, Mike, Scully, Next, Interview, Rupert, Everett, WATCH, VIDEO, FROM, THE,
