be, more, specific, than, the, location, label, you, select., Note:, the, option, to, share, your, precise, location, is, currently, available, only, on, newer, versions, of, Twitter, for, iOS, (6.26, or, later), and, on, newer, versions, of, Twitter, for, Android, (version, 5.55, or, later). , If, you, Tweet, using, an, earlier, version, of, Twitter, for, iOS, or, Twitter, for, Android,, each,
