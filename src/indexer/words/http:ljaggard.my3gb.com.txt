in, their, angle, of, scrutiny., The, latter, are, more, inclined, towards, entertainment, and, commercial, aspects, and, in, the, former,, the, theatrical,, technical, or, artistic, features, are,

an, end., These, are, also, called, 'Acts'., The, three, act, structure, is, most, commonly, used, today., ?, The, beginning, should, be, dynamic,, introduce, the, audience, with, the, set-up., The, main, characters, and, the, turning, point, of, the, story, should, be, brought, in, within, the, first, 10, minutes., ?, Develop, the, story, towards, the, main, conflict, where, the, protagonist's, progress, is, hampered, by, an, antagonist., ?, A, few, sub-plots, and, a, comic, character, bring, a, relieving, change., ?, End, with, the, climax, showing, how, the, protagonist, triumphs, over, the, antagonist, and, how, everything, turns, out, just, right., There, could, be, a, variation, in, the, end,, leaving, the, viewers, debating, over, the, actual, outcome, or, even, in, tears., ?, The, script, should, ideally, be, about, 100, pages., Every, page, represents, approximately, a, minute, of, screen, time., How, to, write, a, film, script, will, no, longer, be, a, problem, if, you:,

who, you, are., Whether, it, ends, up, produced, or, not,, it, is, not, a, reflection, of, your, worth, as, a, human, being., Repeat, after, me, --, even, if, OTHERS, judge, it, as, such,, a, script, is, not, who, you, are., Period., At, most,, it, is, just, an, inkling, of, the, wonders, that, lurk, within, the, folds, of, your, infinite, mind., It, is, a, single, drop, from, the, mysterious, endless, ocean, that, is, churning, in, you, since, the, day, you, were, born.", (2), "Dear, Screenwriter,, REMEMBER:, A, script, is, a, blueprint, to, construct, a, movie, with., Don't, forget, that., Its, ultimate, purpose, is, to, help, an, audience, spend, 90, to, 120, minutes, away, from, the, daily, grind,, and, hopefully, feel, elevated, as, well., Hopefully, they'll, feel, better, about, themselves, and, life, in, general,, even, if, they've, just, watched, a, horror, flick., It's, therapy, through, pictures, in, motion., A, script, is, an, invitation, to, entertainment, and, enchantment;, not, a, do-or-die, proposition., It, is, a, wonderful, thing, to, envision,, write, and, enjoy, but, it, is, not, the, end, of, the, world., You, should, be, ready, and, happy, to, BURN, all, your, scripts, and, never, touch, your, pen, and, keyboard, again, if,, for, example,, it, would, help, find, cure, for, cancer.", (3), "Dear, Screenwriter,, REMEMBER:, 1), The, worst, has, already, happened., 2), Even, if, you, don't, write, a, single, word, --, as, Woody, Allen, put, it, so, well, --, you're, not, gonna, get, out, of, this, alive., 3), So, glue, your, bottom, to, that, chair, and, finish, that, @#$*%, script!", (4), "Dear, Screenwriter,, REMEMBER:, Being, rejected, is, a, future, worry., It, is, not, right, here, now,, this, very, minute., It, is, not, the, past, either., Do, not, be, afraid, of, being, rejected, by, Hollywood, because, you, are, either, in, it,, or, you, aren't., If, you, are, in, it,, you've, taken, your, licks, and, you're, still, ticking., It, means, they, could, not, reject, you, enough, :-), If, you're, not, in, it,, then, how, can, anyone, push, you, out, of, something, that, you're, not, a, part, of?, Rejection, is, a, feeling, that, only, you, can, attach, to, yourself, like, a, scar., Nobody, else, can, do, it, for, you., If, you, don't, do, it, to, yourself,, it'll, never, get, done., Adopt, the, anti-NIKE, motto, --, Just, Don't, Do, It!", (5), "Dear, Screenwriter,, REMEMBER:, Do, not, feel, bad, for, not, having, written, the, CHINATOWN, or, BODY, HEAT, or, CASABLANCA, because, all, movies, are, not, CHINATOWN, or, BODY, HEAT, or, CASABLANCA., There, are, thousands, and, perhaps, tens, of, thousands, of, movies, that, go, straight, to, DVD,, shown, in, all, kinds, of, cable, channels,, PPV, channels,, on, regular, TV, networks,, hospitals,, schools,, conventions,, membership, organizations,, hotels,, in, airplanes, ships, and, buses,, etc., and, God, knows, where, else., In, the, near, future, we'll, all, start, to, watch, movies, regularly, on, our, cell, phones,, Internet, sites,, iPods,, wristwatches, and, cameras,, and, perhaps, may, be, on, our, toasters, and, refrigerators..., There, are, 3,

very, proud, and, satisfied, as, well., You, do, not, need, to, win, an, Oscar, for, a, theatrical-release, feature, to, be, happy, as, a, professional, screenwriter.", (6), "Dear, Screenwriter,, REMEMBER:, You, must, never, regret, if, your, scripts, are, overwritten,, rejected,, or, changed, or, etc., because, writing, and, marketing, scripts, are, not, the, worst, things, that, can, happen, to, a, human, being,, not, by, a, long, shot., You, have, sold, insurance,, used, cars,, and, waited, tables, for, a, living., You, have, sold, kitchen, knives,, orthopedic, beds, and, Tupperware, by, going, door-to-door., You, have, worked, as, a, journalist, chasing, after, pompous, VIPs, and, politicians, for, crumbs, of, news-worthy, tid, bits, that, were, forgotten, the, minute, they, were, published., As, a, wise, and, sensitive, person, you, are, aware, that, as, we, speak, people, are, losing, life, and, limb, in, coal, mines,, ocean-going, vessels,, power, plants,, oil, fields,, and, battlefields, all, over, the, world, as, a, part, of, their, regular, day, jobs., Writing, scripts, is, a, blessing, and, a, luxury,, not, the, worst, thing, that, can, happen, to, anybody., Enjoy, the, privilege, while, you, still, can.", (7), "Dear, Screenwriter,, REMEMBER:, Your, screenplays, already, make, you, very, happy, because, you, write, them, with, great, joy, and, enthusiasm., They, are, all, the, stuff, that, you, would, LOVE, to, watch, on, that, big, screen., Actually,, you're, writing, them, because, you, are, frustrated, that, you, can't, go, and, rent, them, from, your, favorite, video, rental, store., Hopefully, one, day, soon, they'll, also, bring, some, money, and, recognition, as, well, because, you'd, love, to, treat, your, loved, ones, to, much, better,

http://EzineArticles.com/?Dear-Screenwriter---It-Helps-to-Remember-These-Things&id=208950, Sample, Film, Treatment, By, John, Halasz, A, sample, film, treatment, is, a, document, by, a, film, treatment, writer, to, showcase, their, writing, skills., New, film, script, writers, have, to, prove, their, ability, to, write, film, treatments, and, scripts., In, order, to, get, your, foot, in, the, door, of, films, script, writing,, it, is, essential, to, write, a, number, of, samples,, which, can, be, shared., It, is, a, self, marketing, strategy,, which, is, part, of, the, writer's, portfolio., The, screenwriter, should, ideally, prepare, samples, to, suit, every, conceivable, situation, that, may, arise., This, is, done, to, show, potential, customers, that, the, writer, can, accomplish, the, task, of, compiling, extraordinarily-brilliant, film, treatments, and, movie, scripts., Copies, of, the, sample, film, treatment, are, distributed, to, people, in, the, film, industry, as, well, as, literary, agents, and, those, seeking, to, hire, a, ghostwriter., Agents, represent, the, writer, to, the, film, 'insiders'., When, production, houses,, studios,, individual, producers,, or, directors, are, hunting, for, someone, to, author, a, screenplay, or, treatment,, they, can, pull, out, the, spec, samples, submitted, by, different, writers., Another, option, is, for, them, to, approach, agencies,, which, are, in, direct, contact, with, writers, seeking, work., By, evaluating, the, sample, treatment,, the, potential, client, can, pick, and, choose, a, qualified, writer., Wisdom, dictates, that, screenplay, writers, prepare, samples, in, many, genres, and, different, types:, 1., Original, draft, treatment, -, Slightly, longer, and, more, detailed, manuscript, 2., Presentation, treatment, -, A, much, shorter, and, crisper, version, of, a, screenplay, 3., Adaptation, treatment, -, A, treatment, based, on, adapted, work, of, another, novelist., Certain, precautionary, measures, must, be, taken, before, doling, out, copies, of, a, sample, film, treatment,, including, the, following:, , Get, your, work, registered, with, WGA, so, that, your, idea, is, never, stolen., , Give, complete, contact, information, on, the, front, page, of, the, treatment., , Ensure, that, your, work, is, absolutely, flawless, to, make, a, great, impression, on, the, reader., , Accompany, the, treatment, with, a, cover, letter, highlighting, your, expertise,, awards, and, credentials., , If, possible,, attach, a, self, addressed, stamped, envelope, for, ease, of, communication., , Follow, the, industry, norms, regarding, the, format, as, closely, as, possible., Since, treatments, are, considered, "easy, reads,", it, is, important, to, keep, your, sample, film, treatment, brief, without, sacrificing, any, important, element, of, the, story., This, makes, the, treatment, seem, incomplete, or, distorted., Sometimes, it, is, more, difficult, to, compile, articulate, treatments, than, full-fledged, screenplays., Make, reading, a, sample, a, pleasure., Include, enough, white, space, so, that, the, reader, does, not, cringe, from, going, through, it, from, cover, to, cover., If, the, readers, begin, to, lose, interest, or, feel, overburdened,, they, are, likely, to, fling, it, aside, hastily., Your, aim, should, be, to, induce, the, reader, to, go, on, until, reaching, the, end,, setting, it, aside, with, satisfaction., A, well-written, film, treatment, has, improved, chances, of, being, read, and, the, writer, propositioned, to, write, the, full-length, film, script., To, hire, professional, screenwriters, to, write, your, film, treatment,, just, visit, our, screenwriting, website:, http://www.ScreenwritersForHire.Com/, or,

was, slated, to, direct., The, new, screenplay, was, written, by, Andrew, Copp, from, an, original, story, by, Fred, Vogel, and, Andrew, Copp., The, film, was, in, pre-production, for, a, long, time,, and, nearly, financed, when, when, the, most, unfortunate, and, sad, thing, that, could, have, possibly, happened, occurred,, Roger, Watkins, passed, away., Many, options, were, weighed, to, try, to, put, the, film, forward,, including, Copp, directing, the, film., Which, was, a, game, plan, for, a, long, while., But, eventually,, with, Roger, not, around,, the, impetus, to, make, the, film, was, no, longer, there, and, the, production, folded., Fans, often, ask, about, the, movie,, and, the, script, has, become, something, of, a, grassroots, piece, of, folklore, in, the, horror, underground., Some, people, have, even, suggested, it, was, a, myth, (we, are, looking, at, you, posters, on, IMDB)., While, those, few, who, were, on, the, inside, that, got, to, read, it, still, feel, like, they,
