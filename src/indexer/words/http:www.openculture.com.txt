are, inseparable, in, the, hippest, modern, novels,, from, Kerouac, to, Nick, Hornby, to, Irvine, Welsh., It, might, even, be, said, many, such, books, would, not, exist, without, their, internal, soundtracks., When, it, comes, to, hip,, prolific, modern, novelist, Haruki, Murakami,, we, might, say, the, author, himself, may, not, exist, without, his, soundtracks,, and, they, are, sprawling, and, extensive., Murakami,, who, is, well, known, for, his, intense, focus, and, heroic achievements, as, a, marathon, and, double-marathon, runner,, exceeds, even, this, consuming, passion, with, his, near-religious, devotion, to, music., Murakami, became, a, convert, to, jazz, fandom, at, the, age, of, 15, and, until, age, 30, ran, a, jazz, club., Then he, suddenly, became, a, novelist, after, an, epiphany, at, a, baseball, game., (Hear, Ilana, Simons, read, his, version, of, that, story, in, her, short, animated, film, above)., His, first, book’s, story, unfolded, in, an, environment, totally, permeated, by, music, and, music, fan, culture., From, then, on,, musical, references, spilled, from, his, characters’, lips,, and, swirled, around, their, heads, perpetually., What, sets, Murakami, apart, from, other, music-obsessed, novelists, is, not, only, the, degree, of, his, obsession,, but, the, breadth, of, his, musical, knowledge., He, is, as, fluent, in, classical, as, he, as, in, jazz, and sixties, folk, and, pop,, and, his, range, in, each, genre, is, considerable., He, has, so, much, to, say, about, classical, music,, in, fact,, that, he, once, published, a, book, of, six, conversations, between, himself, and, Seiji, Ozawa,, “one, of, the, world’s, leading, orchestral, conductors.”,  Murakami’s, 2013, Colorless, Tsukuru, Tazaki, and, His, Years, of, Pilgrimage—its, title, a, reference, to, Franz, Liszt—contains, perhaps, his, most, eloquent, statement, on, the, role, music, plays, in, his, life, and, work,, phrased, in, universal, terms:, Our, lives, are, like, a, complex, musical, score., Filled, with, all, sorts, of, cryptic, writing,, sixteenth, and, thirty-second, notes, and, other, strange, signs., It’s, next, to, impossible, to, correctly, interpret, these,, and, even, if, you, could,, and, could, then, transpose, them, into, the, correct, sounds,, there’s, no, guarantee, that, people, would, correctly, understand,, or, appreciate,, the, meaning, therein., “At, times,”, writes, Scott, Meslow, at, The, Week,, “reading, Murakami’s, work, can, feel, like, flipping, through, his, legendarily, expansive, record, collection.”, While, we’ve, previously, featured, playlists, drawn, from, Murakami’s, jazz, obsession, and, from, the, general, variety, of, his, discriminating, (yet, thoroughly, Western), musical, palate,, these, have, been, minuscule, by, comparison, with, his, personal, library, of, LPs,, an, “inspirational…, wall, of, 10,000, records,”, the, majority, of, which, are, jazz., Murakami, admits, he, always, listens, to, music, when, he, works,, and, you, can, see, part, of, his, floor-to-ceiling, record, library,, and, huge, speaker, system,, in, a, photo, of, his, desk on, his attractively-designed, website., Down, below,, we, bring, you, one, of, the, next, best, things, to, actually, sitting, in, his study,, a, playlist, of, 3,350 tracks, from, Murakami’s, personal, collection., (If, you, need, Spotify’s, free, software,, download, it, here.), Hoagy, Carmichael,, Lionel, Hampton,, Herbie, Hancock,, Gene, Krupa,, Django, Reinhardt,, Sergei, Prokofiev,, Frederic, Chopin…, it’s, quite, a, mix,, and, one, that, may not, only, remind, you, of, several, moments, in, Murakami’s, body, of, work,, but, will, also, give, you, a, sampling, of, the, soundtrack, to, its author’s, imagination, as, he, transcribes, the, “cryptic, writing”, we, have, to “transpose…, into, the, correct, sounds”, as, we, try, to, make, sense, of, it., Related, Content:, A, 96-Song,

that, we, live, in, a, simulation, in, the, first, place,, has, more, of, an, interest, in, why, others, find, it, so, compelling, all, of, a, sudden., Whether, you, believe, it,, reject, it,, or,

mini-introductions, to, academic, subjects, for, several, years, now, through, his, School, of, Life., These, take, the, form, of, animated, précis, of, the, life, and, work, of, a, handful, of, prominent, authors who, might, be, considered, representative,, if, not, essential,, to, the, discipline., In, philosophy,, we, have, such, indispensable, figures, as, Plato,, Rene, Descartes,, and, Immanuel, Kant., In, political, theory,, we, have, Adam, Smith,, John, Rawls,, Karl, Marx., Wherever, we, land—conservative,, liberal,, or, radical—we, end, up, interacting, with, such, thinkers., When, it, comes, to, the, general, category, of, “Literature,”, however,, it, seems, to, me, it, should, be, a, bit, more, difficult, to, choose, only, a, few, figureheads., For a, good, part, of, European, history,, most, people, couldn’t, read, the, languages, they, spoke,, but, even, those, who, could, were, hardly, considered, literate., This, distinction, was, reserved, for, elites, with, classical, educations, who, read, Latin, and, usually, Greek., Literature, meant, Virgil,, Ovid,, Horace,, Homer…., Even, after, the, Reformation, and, the, spread, of, literacy, in, “vulgar”, tongues,, the, disdain, for, common, tongues remained., The, radicalism, of, Dante, and, later, Cervantes, was, to, write, great, literature, in, their, national, languages., During, the, 18th, century,, the, novel, was, often, considered, primarily, middle, class, women’s, entertainment,, and, in, much, of, the, 19th,, a, popular, diversion, rarely, worthy, of, the, highest, critical, appraisal., The, 20th, century, brought, not, only, modernist, revolutions, but, social, revolutions, that, opened, doors, for, women, voices, and, writers, previously, relegated, to, the, margins., In, our, current, age,, a, diversity, of writers, now, firmly, occupy, the, center, of, culture., The, oughts, were, dominated, by, Junot, Diaz’s, Pulitzer, Prize-winning, The, Brief, Wondrous, Life, of, Oscar, Wao,, for, example., This, year’s, Pulitzer, winners, include, Colson, Whitehead, and, poet, Tyehimba, Jess., Nobel, and, Pulitzer, winner, Toni, Morrison, just, swept, up, another, award, from, the, American, Academy, of, Arts, &, Sciences., This, is, not, to, mention, multiple-award-winning, international, writers, like, Derek, Walcott,, Gabriel, Garcia, Marquez,, Chimamanda, Ngozi, Adichie…., Venerable, western, literary, traditions, have, become, global, in, composition., But, in, every, period, of, literary, history,, international, writers, interacted,, corresponded,, influenced,, and, plagiarized, each, other., There, is, no, single, line, of, descent, through, the, history, of, literature,, no, singular, imperial, story, that, dominates, its, production, and, reception., Its, location, varies, from, age, to, age,, its, families, are, massive, and, sprawling,, loosely, connected, at, the, edges,, but, sometimes, only, very, loosely., Perhaps, it is, a, testament, to, the, patrician, conservatism, of, philosophy, that, it, remains, a, field, dominated, by, responses, to, dead, great, men., Literature, has, proven, much, more, dynamic., De, Botton’s, choices, in, his, introductory, video, series, on, literature, do, not, quite, reflect, this, dynamism., Why, Voltaire, and, not,, well,, Cervantes,, generally, considered, for, centuries, the, father, of, the, modern, novel, form?, Why, no, Faulkner,, Gertrude, Stein,, Haruki, Murakami,, or, Toni, Morrison?, No, Allen Ginsberg,, Margaret, Atwood,, James, Baldwin?, These, authors, and, many, others, may, surely, be, to, come., And, we, should, bear, in, mind, the, source:, not, only, is, de, Botton, a, pop, philosopher, first, and, critic, secondarily,, but, he, is, also, promoting, a, scholarly, approach, to, self-help., The, authors, he, chooses,, therefore,, all, have, life, lessons, to, impart, of, the, kind, de, Botton, believes, can, help, us, be, happier,, nicer, people, who, have, better, relationships., Charles, Dickens,, at, the, top,, for, example,, teaches, us, to, sympathize, with, others, and, to, care, about, “serious, things.”, Jane, Austen, wanted, us, to, be, “better, and, wiser,”, and, her, novels, offer, readers, a, course, in personal, development., From, the, existential, bleakness, of, Fyodor, Dostoyevsky,, we, can, draw, life, lessons, about, hope, and, redemption, in, the, midst, of, human, failure., Even, the, claustrophobic, nightmares, of, Franz, Kafka, have, their, utility, as, “redemptive,, consoling, art.”, De, Botton, largely, relies, on, biographical, criticism, and, strays, quite, a, ways, from, received interpretations., His, casual, approach, to, literature, as, a, didactic, tool, of, personal, betterment, has, the, hallmarks, of, a, very, Victorian, outlook,, with, both, the, drawbacks, and, the, benefits, such, a, view, entails., While, the, School, of, Life, series, may, have, a, narrow, view, of, who, produces, art,, culture,, and, philosophy,, it, also, has, a, compelling, argument, to, make, that, such, things, matter, and, matter, greatly., The, humanities, need, all, the, help, they, can, get,, and, de, Botton, seems, to, argue, that, we, need, them, more, than, ever, as, well., Most, readers, of, Open, Culture,, I, imagine,, would, surely, agree., See, de, Botton’s, full, series,, including, such,

public, lectures, and, his, book, The, Jazz, of, Physics, that, Albert, Einstein, and, John, Coltrane, had, quite, a, lot, in, common., Alexander, in, particular, draws, our, attention, to, the, so-called, “Coltrane, circle,”, which, resembles, what, any, musician, will, recognize, as, the, “Circle, of, Fifths,”, but, incorporates, Coltrane’s, own, innovations., Coltrane, gave, the, drawing, to, saxophonist, and, professor, Yusef, Lateef, in, 1967,, who, included, it, in, his, seminal, text,, Repository, of, Scales, and, Melodic, Patterns., Where, Lateef,, as, he, writes in, his, autobiography,, sees Coltrane’s, music, as, a, “spiritual, journey”, that, “embraced, the, concerns, of, a, rich, tradition, of, autophysiopsychic, music,”, Alexander, sees, “the, same, geometric, principle, that, motivated, Einstein’s”, quantum, theory., Neither, description, seems, out, of, place., Musician, and, blogger, Roel, Hollander, notes,, “Thelonious, Monk, once, said, ‘All, musicans, are, subconsciously, mathematicians.’, Musicians, like, John, Coltrane, though, have, been, very, much, aware, of, the, mathematics, of, music, and, consciously, applied, it, to, his, works.”, Coltrane, was, also, very, much, aware, of, Einstein’s, work, and, liked, to, talk, about, it, frequently., Musican, David, Amram, remembers, the, Giant, Steps, genius, telling, him, he, “was, trying, to, do, something, like, that, in, music.”, Hollander, carefully, dissects, Coltrane’s, mathematics, in, two theory-heavy, essays,, one, generally, on, Coltrane’s, “Music, &, Geometry”, and, one, specifically, on, his, “Tone, Circle.”, Coltrane, himself, had, little, to, say, publically, about, the, intensive, theoretical, work, behind, his, most, famous, compositions,, probably because, he’d, rather, they, speak, for, themselves., He, preferred, to, express, himself, philosophically, and, mystically,, drawing, equally, on, his, fascination, with, science, and, with, spiritual, traditions, of, all kinds., Coltrane’s, poetic, way, of, speaking, has, left, his, musical, interpreters, with, a, wide, variety, of, ways, to, look, at, his, Circle,, as, jazz, musician, Corey, Mwamba, discovered, when, he, informally, polled, several, other, players, on, Facebook., Clarinetist, Arun, Ghosh,, for, example, saw, in, Coltrane’s, “mathematical, principles”, a, “musical, system, that, connected, with, The, Divine.”, It’s, a, system,, he, opined,, that, “feels, quite, Islamic, to, me.”, Lateef, agreed,, and, there, may, be, few who, understood, Coltrane’s, method, better, than, he, did., He studied, closely, with, Coltrane, for, years,, and, has, been, remembered, since, his, death, in, 2013, as, a, peer, and, even, a, mentor,, especially, in, his, ecumenical, embrace, of, theory, and, music, from, around, the, world., Lateef, even, argued, that, Coltrane’s, late-in-life, masterpiece, A, Love, Supreme might, have, been, titled, “Allah, Supreme”, were, it, not, for, fear, of, “political, backlash.”, Some, may, find, the, claim, tendentious,, but, what, we, see, in, the, wide, range, of, responses, to, Coltrane’s, musical, theory,, so, well, encapsulated, in, the, drawing, above,, is, that, his, recognition,, as, Lateef, writes,, of, the, “structures, of, music”, was, as, much, for, him, about scientific, discovery, as, it, was, religious, experience. Both, for, him, were, intuitive, processes, that, “came, into, existence,”, writes, Lateef,, “in, the, mind, of, the, musican, through, abstraction, from, experience.”, Related, Content:, The, Secret, Link,

Macat’s, analysis,, argued, in The, Second, Sex, that, “the, views, of, individuals, are, socially, and, culturally, produced., Femininity, is, not, inherent,”, but, a, societal, mechanism, long, used, “to, keep, men, dominant.”, According, to, their video, on, Foucault’s Discipline, and, Punish,, that, famous, book “explores, the, evolution, of, power, since, the, Middle, Ages,”, culminating, in, the, argument, that, “modern, states, have, moved, away, from, exploring, their, authority, physically, to, enforcing, it, psychologically,”, a, phenomenon, exemplified, as, much, by, late, 18th-, and, early, 19th-century, philosopher, Jeremy, Bentham’s, Panopticon, as, by, modern, closed-circuit, television, urban, omni-surveillance, (a, technology now, spread, far, beyond, the, infamously, CCTV-zealous, London, all, the, way, to, Seoul,, where, I, live). In The, Republic,, Plato, asks, more, basic, questions, about, society:, “What, would, an, ideal, state, look, like,, and, how, would, it, work?”, For, that ancient, Greek,, says, the, video’s, narrator,, “the, ideal, society, offered, the, guarantee of, justice, and, would, be, ruled, over, not, by, a, tyrant,, but, by, an, all-powerful, philosopher-king.”, Whether, or, not, that, strikes, you, as, an, appealing, prospect,, or, indeed, whether, you, agree, with de, Beauvoir, and, Foucault’s, bold, propositions,, you, stand, to, sharpen, your, mind, by, engaging, with, these, and, other, influential ideas,, including, (as, covered, in Macat’s, other, three-, to, four-minute, analyses), those, of, Machiavelli,, David, Hume, Edward, Said,, and Thomas, Piketty., “Critical, thinking, is, about, to, become, one, of, the, most, in-demand, set, of, skills, in, the, global, jobs, market,”, insists Macat’s,

SubscribeGoogleWhatsappPinterestDiggLinkedinStumbleuponVkPrintDeliciousBufferPocketXingTumblrMailYummlyTelegramFlipboard, A, couple, days, ago,, a, visually, compelling, thread, on, Twitter, exploded, with, thousands, of, shares, and, likes, and, dozens, of, users, submitting, their, own, contributions., The, thread, (a, series, of, connected, tweets, for, the, Twitter, uninitiated), has, become, an, evolving, photo, essay, of, women, activists, standing, up, to, walls, of, militarized, riot, police, and, mobs, of, angry, bigots., The, photos, feature subjects, like, Tess, Asplund,, Leshia, Evans,, and, Saffiyah, Khan,, and, historical, inspirations, like, Gloria, Richardson, and, Bernadette, Devlin., Many, of, the, subjects, are, unknown, or, unnamed,, but, no, less, iconic., These, images,, from, all, over, the, world,, of, women, standing, defiantly, and, often, alone,, against, heavily, armed, and, armored,, mostly, male, power, structures, inspire, and,, in, the, case, of, children, like, Ruby, Bridges,, can, break, your, heart., Photos, like, these, serve, as, powerful, and, necessary, testaments, to, the, fact, that, in, social, movements, throughout, history,, women, have, held, the, front, lines., And, photographers, have, captured, their, activist, spirit, since, the, early, days, of, the, medium., In, the, 19th, century,, long, exposures, and, fragile,, finicky, equipment, made, action, shots, difficult-to-impossible,, and, for, a, variety, of, cultural, reasons,, many, women, were, far, less, likely, to, confront, armed, men, on, the, streets., Therefore,, the, portraits, of, women, activists, from, the, time, tend, toward, traditional, seated, poses., But, as, famous, photographs, of, Harriet, Tubman, and, Sojourner, Truth, demonstrate,, these, images, do, not, show, us, passive, observers, of, history., Pictures, of, Tubman, and, Truth, have, made, their, way, into, every, elementary, school, history, textbook., Far, less, well-known, are, the, many, other, African-American, women, activists, of, the, late-nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, centuries, who, fought, for, the, rights, of, black, Americans, in, education,, at, the, voting, booth,, and, everywhere, else., During, Reconstruction, especially,, many, such, activists, rose, to, prominence, in, academia,, journalism,, and, civic, leadership., Women, like, Fannie, Barrier, Williams,, at, the, top,, whose, wise,, direct, gaze, illustrates, her, fearlessness, as, an, educational, reformer, and, suffragist,, who,, despite, her, maiden, name,, broke, several, barriers, for, black, women, in, higher, education, and, prominent, public, events, like, the, 1893, Columbian, Exposition., Against, paternalistic, claims, that, former, slaves, weren’t, ready, for, citizenship,, writes, the, Rochester, Regional, Library, Council,, Williams, “called, on, all, women, to, unite, and, claim, their, inalienable, rights.”, Above,, we, see, Laura, A., Moore, Westbrook., Of, the, first, generation, to, grow, up, after, slavery,, Westbrook, received, a, master’s, degree, in, 1880,, the, only, woman, in, a, class, of, four., She, went, on, to, teach, and, fight, fiercely, for, formerly, enslaved, students, in, Texas,, earning, admiration,, as, Monroe, Alphus, Majors, wrote, in, 1893,, “in, conspicuous, instances, and, under, very, flattering, circumstances”, from, contemporaries, like, Frederick, Douglass., Majors’, characterization, will, sound, patronizing, to, our, ears,, but, in, the, rigid, terms, of, the, time,, it, offers, nearly, as, vivid, a, portrait, as, her photograph:, “Her, motive, to, do, good, far, surpasses, her, vanity,, except, when, her, race, is, attacked,, then,, manlike,, she, with, the, pen, strikes, back,, and, even, goes, beyond, her, loyalty, to, serve,, but, makes, lasting, impressions, upon, those, who, are, so, unfortunate, to, get, within, her, range.”, These, images, come, from, a, Library, of, Congress, archive, of, nineteenth-century, African, American, activists, from, the, collection, of, William, Henry, Richards,, a, professor, at, Howard, University, Law, School, from, 1890, to, 1928, and, a, staunch, campaigner, for, civil, rights, and, liberties., Most, of, the, portraits, are, of, the, formal,, staged, variety,, but, we, also, have, the, more, relaxed,, even, playful, series, of, poses, from, activists, Elizabeth, Brooks, and, Emma, Hackley,, above., Richards’, collection,, writes, curator, Beverly, Brannon, at, the, LoC, site,, includes, many, “people, who, joined, him, and, others, working, in, the, suffrage, and, temperance, movements, and, in, education,, journalism, and, the, arts.”, The, photographs, “show, the, women, at, earlier, ages, than, most, portraits, previously, available, of, them, online.”, These, portraits, date, from, a, time,, notes, Allison, Meier, at, Hyperallergic,, when, “rights, and, opportunities, for, African, Americans,, especially, women,, remained, severely, limited.”, Many, “obscure, black, women, writers,”, journalists,, and, teachers, “await, their, biographers,”,  argues, Jonathan, Daniel, Wells,, and, perhaps, the, rediscovery, of, these, photographs, will, prompt, historians, to, reconsider, their, prominence., While, they, did, not, physically, stand, up, to, armed, mobs, or police, battalions,, these, activists,, writes, Meier,, “spoke, out, boldly, against, gender, inequality,, while, at, the, same, time, remaining, cognizant, that, especially, in, the, so-called, New, South,, racism,, violence, and, murder, were, ever-present, dangers, for, African, American, women, and, men.”, Hyperallergic/Library, of, Congress, Related, Content:, 1.5, Million, Slavery, Era, Documents, Will, Be,

for, a, couple, generations, of, art-house thrillseekers,, but, he, didn’t, start, his, creative, journey, in, cinema., Decades, before, he, sent, his, audiences, on, the, mind-altering, feature-length, trips, (whether, or, not, they, came, prepared, for, them, with, their, own, mind-altering, substances), like El, Topo, and The, Holy, Mountain,, he, wrote, poetry,, worked, as, a, clown,, founded, and, directed, a, theater, troupe,, and, after, relocating, from, his, native, Chile, to, France,, studied, mime, and, performed with, Marcel, Marceau., Only, then, had, life, prepared, him, to, make, his, first, film,, 1957’s La, Cravate., Telling, its, story, in, vivid, color, but, without, words,, the, short (which, also, goes, under, such, titles, as, Les, têtes, interverties, The, Transposed, Heads,, and, most, sensationalistically The, Severed, Heads), draws, on, Jodorowsky, and, his, collaborators’, skills, developed, in, the, performing, arts, to, convert, into, cinematic, mime, Thomas, Mann’s, 1950, novella The, Transposed, Heads:, A, Legend, of, India., Novelist, Rayo, Casablanca, quotes, Jodorowsky, describing, the, tale, as, one, of, “a, woman, who, has, an, intellectual, husband,, who, is, very, weak, physically., She, also, has, a, muscular, but, idiotic, lover., She, cuts, the, heads, off, of, the, two, men, and, interchanges, them., She, remains, with, the, muscular, body, and, the, head, of, the, intellectual., However,, after, a, certain, time,, the, body, of, the, athlete, is, softened, and, the, body, of, the, intellectual, becomes, vigorous, and, muscular.”, Mann,, in, Jodorowsky’s, reading,, “wanted, to, thus, say, that, it, is, the, intellect, which, makes, the, body,”, but, for, nearly, fifty, years,, his, own, visual, interpretation, went, unseen., Not, long, after, its, premiere, at, Rome’s, Cinema, Auteur, Festival, in, 1957, it, went, missing,, presumed, lost,, until, the, sole, print’s rediscovery, in, a, German, attic, in, 2006. Finally,, Jodorowsky’s, fans could, see, not, just, his, directorial, debut, but, his, first, starring, role, onscreen,, with, a, supporting, cast, that, included, the, Belgian, surreal, humorist, Raymond, Devos., The, film’s, moral, writes, Dangerous, Minds’, Paul, Gallagher,, “is, never, to, lose, your, head, over, unrequited, love,, but, find, someone, who, loves,

from, the, audience, on, Jimmy, Kimmel, Live!,, for, example,, and, it, is, well-deserved—they’re, stars, in, their, own, right—but, you, probably won’t, recognize, their, names., They’re, American, Sign, Language, interpreters, of, pop, music,, and, their, craft, involves, not, only, a, mastery, of, ASL,, but, also, empathy,, creativity,, spontaneity,, dance,, and, some, of, the, vivid, interpretive, moves, of, an, air, guitar, champion, (a, rare, art, form, indeed)., In, the, video, explainer, from, Vox, above,, we, meet, one, of, the, most, talented, of, such, interpreters,, the, poised, yet, highly, animated, Amber, Galloway, Gallego., She, has, interpreted, over, 400, artists—“literally, every, artist, you, could, think, of”—including, stadium, fillers, like Adele,, Kendrick, Lamar,, Drake,, and,, as, you, can, see, below, in, video, from, last, year’s, Lollapalooza,, the, Red, Hot, Chili, Peppers,, whose, melancholy, “Under, the, Bridge”, takes, on, an, entirely, new energy, through, Gallego’s, expressive, hands,, face,, and, body, (she, first, appears, at, 1:22)., As, she, explains, to, Vox,, ASL, interpreters, have, for, years, communicated, music, to, their, audiences, by, drily making, the, sign, in, English, for, “Music”, and, leaving, it, at, that., For, Gallego, this, was, totally, insufficient., The, deaf, community, includes, “a, diverse, group, of, people,”, the, Vox, narrator, says,, “who, have, a, wide, range, of, residual, hearing”, across, the, audible, spectrum., And, everyone, can, feel, music, at, certain, volumes,, especially, in, a, live, concert, setting., But, an, interpreter,, Gallego, suggests,, should be, prepared, not, only, to, translate, the, lyrics, of, a, song,, but, also, the, rhythm, and,, to, a, certain, degree,, the, melody, and, harmony,, as, well, as, the, general vibe,, allowing, deaf, concert, goers, to, be, part, of, the, total, experience,, as, she, puts, it., (She, can, even, interpret, beatboxing.), Since, ASL, already, incorporates, emotive, gestures, and, facial, expressions,, Gallego, simply, adapted, and, expanded, these, into, a, repertoire, of, dance, and, musical, sign., She, interprets, frequency,, bringing, her, arms, and, hands, closer, to, her, waist, for, lower, sounds, and, at, her, shoulders, and, above, for, high, notes., She, communicates, pitch, and, rhythm, with, her, face, and, hands, in, ways, that, both, mimic, the, movement, of, sound, waves, and, communicate, how, much, she, herself, is, grooving, to, a, tune., “If, we, merely, show, the, sign, for, music,”, Gallego, insists,, “then, we, are, doing, an, injustice, as, an, interpreter.”, Be, warned,, ASL, interpreters,, she, sets, the, bar, high., To, convey, the, meaning, of, a, song’s, lyrical, content, a, music, interpreter, must, translate, a, tremendous, amount, of, wordplay,, rhyme,, and, metaphor, into, a, visual, form, of, communication., In, the, Vox, video,, Gallego, shows, how, she, does, this, effectively, at, the, speed, of, Eminem’s, motor, mouth, in, a, song, like, “The, Monster,”, and,, though, I, can’t, speak, to, the, experience, of, someone, from, the, deaf, community,, it’s, impressive., Gallego’s enthusiastic, innovation, and, embrace, of, music, signing, has, generated, dozens, of, video, interpretations, on, her, YouTube, channel, (including, classics, of, both, Christmas, and, kids’, music, and, the, irresistible, glee, of, Chewbacca, mom)., And, she has, also, promoted, her, rock-star-worthy, work, to, millions, on, TV, shows, like Totally, Biased, with, W., Kamau, Bell, and,, as, I, mentioned, Jimmy, Kimmel, Live!,, where,, as, you, can, see, above,, she, tag, teams, (for, the, win), with, two, fellow, music, interpreters, in, a battle,
