[I, Am, Sitting, In, A, Room, Commentary, and, thoughts, on, (mostly), classical, music., Friday,, May, 22,, 2009, Cliburn, Competition, The, Van, Cliburn, Competition, starts, today., Like, the, previous, competition, in, 2005,, they, are, streaming, live, video., I'll, probably, get, sucked, into, watching, quite, a, bit,, though, there, are, almost, *no*, really, intriguing, programs, posted., Oh,, there's, the, occassional, rarity, from, the, peripherary, of, the, 19th-, or, early, 20th-c., canon,, but, my, cursory, glance, didn't, notice, a, sudden, uptick, in, Ligeti, etudes, (for, crying, out, loud,, these, should, be, canonic, by, now), or, anything, like, that., In, the, second, round, the, competitors, have, to, program, one, of, the, four, pieces, in, the, running, for, a, composition, prize,, the, American, Composers, Invitational., The, composers, are, Mason, Bates,, Derek, Bermel,, Daron, Hagen,, and, John, Musto., The, partial, glance, I, made, through, the, programs, suggests, that, the, Hagen, piece, will, get, the, most, play., One, of, the, most, entertaining, things, about, the, last, Cliburn, was, following, the, blog, and, its, comments., The, latter, are, everything, you, could, expect, --, earnest,, snarky,, penetrating,, backstabbing,, etc., Conspiracy, theories, abounded, (especially, about, whether, a, particular, professor, had, undue, influence, over, the, fate, of, her, many, affiliated, students)., posted, by, jason, @, 8:26, AM,   , 19, comments, Wednesday,, April, 29,, 2009, Congrats, Steve, Reich!, Along, with, the, rest, of, the, music, community,, I, offer, my, sincere, congratulations, to, Steve, Reich, for, (finally), receiving, a, Pulitzer, Prize, in, music., You, can, hear, the, entire, piece, at, Carnegie, Hall's, Commissions, Page,, played, by, eighth, blackbird., There, are, no, performer, credits, on, the, page, or, in, the, pop-up, window, (blech),, but, click, on, "See, Details", for, a, piece, and, the, information, comes, up., I, saw, 8bb, play, the, piece, over, the, summer,, and, though, I, enjoyed, its, energy,, I, got, a, feeling, of, general, rather, than, outstanding, quality, from, it., So, the, argument, that, the, Pulitzer, was, a, lifetime-achievement, recognition, has, some, legs, in, this, corner, of, the, blogosphere., Maybe, I'll, change, my, mind, after, a, few, more, listens., posted, by, jason, @, 7:58, AM,   , 6, comments, Wednesday,, April, 22,, 2009, Orchestras, The, Orchestra:, "Defiant, Cockroach, of, the, Post-Nuclear, Cultural, Wasteland.", Thank, you,, Matthew, Guerreri!, (Matthew's, blog.), Take, a, Friend, to, the, Orchestra, month, reminds, me, that, I, haven't, been, getting, there, enough, myself, in, the, past, two, seasons., (To, say, nothing, of, not, blogging, when, I, have, gone*...I'm, a, crappy, blogger.), Recent, Cincinnati, Symphony-related, links:, Cincinnati, critic, Janelle, Gelfand, contributes, a, TAFTO, article;, Conductor, Paavo, Järvi, was, sentenced, yesterday, for, operating, a, vehicle, while, intoxicated--hate, for, negative, publicity, to, be, the, only, way, to, get, the, symphony, in, the, news., I, can, imagine, all, the, tut-tutting, going, on, in, response, to, this,, but, I, say, if, he, keeps, conducting, like, he, has, been, while, we've, been, in, Cincinnati,, let, 'im, drink, all, he, wants., CSO, is, world-class,, especially, when, Paavo's, conducting., It's, one, of, the, things, I'll, miss, most, about, leaving, town.**, *, PS, -, Radu, Lupu, &, Yefim, Bronfman, were, great, this, season., Bronfman's, Brahms, 2nd, Concerto, was, huge;, I've, never, heard, such, a, big, sound, with, so, many, different, colors--even, more, impressive, in, cavernous, Music, Hall., **, This, blog, is, Jacksonville-bound, in, August., What's, going, on, musically, there?, Don't, know, yet., Stay, tuned., posted, by, jason, @, 6:02, PM,   , 1, comments, Wednesday,, August, 13,, 2008, Nat'l, Lefty, Day, August, 13, is, National, Lefthanders, Day!, Both, I, and, the, better, half, (upgraded, to, "the, wife", as, of, July, 5th), are, lefties,, so, are, various, family, members., The, clerk, at, our, little, nearby, post, office, celebrated, with, cake, and, made, all, of, her, customers, sign, their, credit, card, slips, left, handed., The, samples, she, showed, us, were, pretty, entertaining., Thanks, to, Steve, Smith,, I, now, know, that, Kaija, Saariaho, is, a, lefty,, too., I, like, the, anecdote, Steve, has, about, her, troubles, writing, manuscript, scores--they, sound, familiar., If, you, haven't, read, it, yet,, follow, the, link, on, his, post, to, his, recent, NYTimes, profile, of, Saariaho., I'm, still, hoping, to, be, in, the, vicinity, of, a, performance, of, either, opera, or, La, Passion, de, Simone, someday., The, better, half, shows, off, her, left, hand,, new, rings, and, her, mussels, (in, Nice!)., posted, by, jason, @, 8:11, PM,   , 2, comments,

connection, between, two, opus, 80s, in, F, minor:, the, Prokofiev, Violin, Sonata, and, the, Mendelssohn, Quartet., Naturally, I, would, collect, other, 80s, into, a, playlist:, Bach,, Cantata, 80,

is, a, very, good, thing., posted, by, jason, @, 9:30, AM,   , 1, comments, Monday,, August, 20,, 2007, Pictures?, Why, not?, My, orchid, just, finished, blooming, for, the, first, time, in, 2, years., I, wish, it, would, bloom, more, regularly,, but, then, it, probably, wishes, it, were, fertilized, once, in, a, while., Sometime, a, couple, years, back, I, searched, in, vain, for, pictures, of, Royal, Poinciana, trees., They, grow, all, over, Miami, and, bloom, beautifully,, but, this, is, the, first, time, in, a, long, while, that, I, got, home, during, the, blooming, season., This, one's, on, the, University, of, Miami, campus., To, get, the, idea, of, full, bloom,, image, the, orange-red, blooms, covering, the, whole, canopy, like, a, blanket., Also, on, campus,, ibises!, Which, makes, sense--the, school's, mascot, is, an, ibis., Quoth, the, UM, website:, "Folklore, maintains, that, the, Ibis,, a, symbol, of, knowledge, found, in, the, Everglades, and, Egypt,, is, the, last, sign, of, wildlife, to, take, shelter, before, a, hurricane, and, the, first, to, reappear, after, the, storm.", One, more...The, hippest, looking, beer, I, know, is, Brother, Thelonious, Belgian, Abbey, Ale., The, better, half, just, ran, across, a, web, reference, to, it, (on, Cafe, Aman),, so, at, the, local, liquor, emporium, we, picked, up, a, bottle., Proceeds, go, to, the, T.,
