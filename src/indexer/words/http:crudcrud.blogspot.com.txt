[CRUD, CRUD, CRUD, CRUD, is, a, tour, through, the, stacks, of, records,, demo, tapes,, etc., that, surround, me., No, recycled, MP3s,, CD, tracks,, or, reissues, here., Average, price, paid, for, the, records, below, is, $3., Very, few, I, have, spent, more, than, $5, on., I, present, to, you, some, of, my, favorites., It, keeps, the, guilt, of, hording, this, crud, distant., 6.20.2012, The, Ethics, of, This, Stuff, I've, been, doing, this, blog, for, years, and, it, has, provided, many, of, you, with, much, good, music., It, is, also, something, that, I, have, enjoyed, doing., When, I, started, doing, it,, I, struggled, with, the, issue, of, posting, music, without, compensating, the, artist., I, rationalized, my, actions, by, not, posting, full, releases,, by, (mostly), sticking, with, obscure, and, very, difficult, to, find, releases,, by, not, running, ads,, by, hosting, the, music, myself, and, not, through, some, scumbags, like, Megaupload,, etc., But, the, fact, is,, these, were, rationalizations., Oh,, sure, there, is, the, little, disclaimer, at, the, side, stating, all, music, is, up, here, for, educational, purposes, and, that, it, will, be, removed, by, request, -, but,, while, not, dishonest,, that, statement, is, born, out, of, an, urge, to, cover, one's, ass, rather, than, any, felt, obligation, to, educate., And,, while, I, have, never, had, a, complaint, about, Crud, Crud, from, an, artist, or, artist, representative, (in, fact,, I've, gotten, fan, letters, from, artists, I've, posted),, I, have, always, felt, a, bit, uncomfortable, doing, this., Besides, doing, this, blog,, I, also, run, a, couple, small, record, labels., Over, the, years,, sales, have, gone, from, pretty, damn, good, to, not, very, damn, good,, almost, pretty, damn, bad., Meanwhile,, the, music, I, put, out, has, gotten, more, and, more, popular., Many, people, listen, to, it,, but, they, don't, pay, for, it., One, of, the, Nothing, People, found, a, torrent, site, that, tracked, the, number, of, times, a, file, had, been, downloaded., He, looked, up, their, (then), most, recent, album, Soft, Crash, and, found, that, it, had, been, downloaded, 40,000, times., How, many, of, those, people, listened, to, it, is, unknown,, perhaps, half, of, the, downloaders, are, hoarders., But, let's, say, half, of, the, people, who, downloaded, it, listened, to, it,, that, an, audience, of, 20,000, got, the, album, for, free., Now, consider, how, many, copies, of, Soft, Crash, my, label, sold., I, pressed, 1000, copies, on, vinyl., The, band, was, compensated, with, 200, copies., About, 50, copies, were, sent, out, as, promos, to, radio, stations,, magazines,, and, blogs., Of, the, 750, remaining, copy,, I, have, sold, 650., I, will, assume, that, the, Nothing, People, held, on, to, 50, copies, and, sold, the, rest., So, that, is, a, grand, total, of, 800, copies, of, Soft, Crash, sold, vs, at, least, 20,000, downloaded, off, one, torrent, site, and, listened, to., The, 800, copies, that, the, Nothing, People, and, I, sold, were, paid, for., The, 20,000, "copies", off, of, that, torrent, site, were, not., I've, know, about, this, for, a, few, years, and, it, still, bugs, the, shit, out, of, me., However,, I, have, still, done, this, blog. ,   , About, a, week, ago, a, young, intern, at, NPR, wrote, a, piece, stating, that, she, had, 11,000, songs, in, her, computer, but, only, had, bought, 15, cds, ever., She, felt, a, little, guilty, but, what, she, was, doing, was, to, convenient, to, change., David, Lowery, of, the, bands, Cracker, &, Camper, Van, Beethoven, wrote, a, very, passionate,, well-thought-out, and, informative, response,, which, I, urge, you, to, read., It, is, long, but, you, will, learn, a, lot, about, how, music, and, the, internet, works, these, days, and, what, "artists", like, myself, are, up, against., (The, link, to, the, initial, NPR, piece, is, in, the, first, paragraph, of, Lowery's, letter). , Knowing, that, since, the, beginning, of, this, blog,, I've, danced, around, the, issues, addressed, by, Lowery,, that, I've, complained, about, regarding, the, Soft, Crash, album,, I, can, no, longer, continue, doing, Crud, Crud, as, I, have, been, doing, it., I, mean,, technically, I, could,, but, to, do, so, would, make, me, more, of, a, hypocrite, than, I, already, am, and, that, is, something, I, do, not, want, to, be., So,, until, I, can, figure, how, to, do, Crud, Crud, in, a, way, that, I, find, is, honest, and, ethical, (such, as, getting, permission, to, post, things,, recording, music/sounds, out, in, the, wild,, using, music, which, I, own, the, rights, to,, etc.),, this, thing, will, be, on, hiatus, (hiatus, not, retirement). , #, posted, by, Scott, Soriano, :,

Before, Crud, Crud,, I, did, a, record, review, site, called, Soriano's, Occasional, Review., On, it,, I, reviewed, records, like, I, do, here,, though, with, no, MP3s., Maybe, a, few, of, you, saw, that, site,, most, of, you, probably, did, not., It, was, pre-blogosphere,, linked, to, no, one,, found, out, only, by, friends, and, those, who, did, an, internet, search, for, a, certain, record., Every, once, in, a, while, on, Crud, Crud, I, recycle, a, review, I, did, there;, however,, computers, being, what, they, are, and, me, not, being, the, most, studious, backer-upper,, a, lot, of, the, reviews, are, lost, to, memory., My, review, of, the, classic, children's, record, Clyde, &, Phyllis, is, one, of, those, lost, to, technology., That, loss, is, fine, because, there, is, more, to, the, story, than, the, original, review., But, but, but, to, get, to, that, story, we, must, start, with, the, record., Clyde, &, Phyllis, is, more, than, a, children's, record,, it, is, a, bubblegum, pop, opera., The, music, is, pure, bubblegum,, sweet, but, not, saccharine,, funny,, engaging,, and, creative., The, story, is, great, and, it, goes, like, this., Clyde, is, a, guitar, playing, elephant., Having, learned, his, craft, in, the, zoo,, he, plays, for, animal, and, humankind,, billed, as, the, "World's, First, Guitar, Playing, Elephant.", His, popularity, grows, such, that, he, is, able, to, open, his, own, night, club,, Clyde's, Den., One, night, he, spies, Phyllis, in, the, crowd., She, is, not, mere, groupie, bait, but, heartthrob, material., Clyde, desperately, wants, her., However,, He, has, two, problems:, First,, Phyllis, kind, of, likes, someone, else., He, tries, to, conquer, this, obstacle, by, showing, up, at, her, house, to, serenade, her., Phyllis, informs, him, that, it, ain't, gonna, work., Clyde, is, "too, big", for, her,, and, "too, much, to, handle.", Phyllis,, you, see,, is, an, ant., Clyde, walks, off, dejected,, actually,, defeated., In, his, wanders,, he, discovers, that, NASA, is, looking, for, an, astronaut, to, explore, the, moon, for, 20, years., He, applies, and, becomes, the, world's, first, elephantnaut., He, figures, that, since, he, can't, have, Phyllis, he, "might, as, well, explore, the, moon.", Once, there,, though,, he, gets, depressed, so, he, mopes, around, singing, to, himself., His, wandering, is, interrupted, by, a, pissed, off, Moon., The, Moon, doesn't, like, the, fact, that, someone, is, on, him, and, threatens, Clyde., Clyde, explains, that, he, is, only, on, the, Moon, because, he, can't, have, his, true, love, on, Earth., The, Moon, considers, Clyde's, situation, and, tells, him, that, he, will, think, about, it., True, to, his, word,, the, Moon, comes, up, with, an, idea., Why, don't, Clyde, and, Phyllis, get, married, and, move, to, the, Moon., Out, in, space,, gravity, will, keep, him, from, crushing, her., (The, Moon, doesn't, figure, out, how, they, will, consummate, this, relationship,, elephant, penis, and, ant, vagina, being, two, radically, different, sizes, -, or, so, I, am, told.), Clyde, thinks, the, idea, is, great., He, hops, into, his, space, shop,, goes, down, to, Earth, and, proposes, to, Phyllis., She, says,, "Yes,", and, they, take, off, to, space., End, of, story...at, least, the, story, of, Clyde, &, Phyllis., I, think, I, wrote, a, bit, more, about, how, great, a, record, it, was, and, that, I, found, it, for, a, buck, up, in, Diamond, Springs, at, the, Ye, Olde, Record, Shoppe, and, bought, it, because,, hell,, would, you, pass, up, a, record, with, a, guitar, playing,, glammed, out, elephant, on, it?, Certainly, not., After, that, review,, I, got, a, bunch, of, emails., One, of, them, was, from, Roger, Flax's, son,, who, told, me, that, he, remembered, his, dad, making, the, record, and, it, got, a, lot, of, spins, at, the, Flax, Manor., There, were, a, few, notes, thanking, me, for, bringing, back, good,, childhood, memories., The, record, collectors, wrote, to, ask, about, pressing, info., And, then, there, were, the, people, who, wanted, a, copy, of, it., My, policy, then, was, my, policy, now:, I, don't, make, copies, of, things, I, post., It, is, not, that, I, want, to, deprive, people, of, the, music., Nah,, it, is, that, I, have, a, life, and, do, not, have, the, time, to, make, tapes, or, CDRs, of, every, record, that, stirs, a, fond, memory., The, problem, with, Clyde, &, Phyllis, is, that, I, seemed, to, be, the, only, person, in, the, world, (according, to, Google, and, Yahoo), who, had, a, copy, of, the, record., The, requests, came, often, and, they, came, hard., Please., Please., Please., I, will, send, you, money,, all, the, money, you, want, (within, reason),, I, was, told., A, woman, from, San, Francisco, named, Susan, wrote, that, she, would, bake, me, a, pie., A, pie?, Well,, I, have, been, known, to, be, a, prisoner, of, pie., Hmmm...., No., No., Sorry, lady,, save, your, pie, for, another, guy., Then, Professor, Cantaloupe, wrote., He, hosted, a, radio, show, that, focused, on, kid's, music., Well,, I, wasn't, going, to, turn, down, a, fellow, dejay,, especially, one, named, Professor, Cantaloupe., So, I, made, a, CDR, of, it, and, contacted, the, people, who, wanted, a, copy, of, the, recording, and, requested, a, couple, bucks,, some, music,, or, a, bottle, of, single, malt, Scotch., Only, a, few, people, replied, but, one, was, Susan, from, San, Francisco,, the, lady, who, offered, me, a, pie., Susan, wrote, that, she, was, in, San, Francisco, and, she, desperately, wanted, the, recording., Perhaps, she, might, have, a, friend, drive, her, to, Sacramento, to, pick, it, up?, "Clyde, &, Phyllis, is, very, important, to, me,", she, wrote., "I, checked, it, out, of, the, school, library, and, only, returned, it, when, I, was, forced, to., Unfortunately,, the, next, person, to, have, the, record, after, me, broke, it!", She, added, that, she, had, been, searching, for, the, record, for, years, and, I, was, a, saint, or, some, kind, of, deity, for, offering, her, a, recording, of, the, record., At, least,, I, think, that, is, how, that, went., Anyway,, she, hemmed, and, hawwed, about, what, she, wanted, to, do, and, then, wrote, that, she's, send, Scotch., Fine, by, me,, lady., I, get, the, Scotch, and, you, will, get, the, CDR., The, Scotch, came, on, the, best, of, all, possible, days., I, had, just, spent, all, day, in, an, emergency, room, dealing, with, my, mom's, complications, from, chemotherapy., I, was, beat., I, stopped, by, work, to, check, my, mail, and, there, was, a, very, nice, bottle, of, single, malt, waiting, for, me., CDR, was, popped, in, the, mail, and, an, email, was, sent, to, Susan, thanking, her, for,

me, emails., Those, who, have, written, me, know, that, I, can, be, one, chatty, fucker, and, sometimes, even, funny., I, charmed, her, with, my, humor,, she, charmed, me, with, hers., She, told, me, what, kind, of, music, she, liked., I, sent, her, House, of, Love, and, Patty, Waters., She, asked, if, she, could, buy, me, a, drink, the, next, time, I, was, in, Frisco., I, said, sure, and, left, it, at, that., She, finally, called, me, on, my, delay, tactics., I, made, up, a, work, related, task, that, would, take, me, there, and, told, her, I, would, be, wearing, a, beret, and, a, kilt., She, almost, canceled, our, "date.", I, assured, her, that, I, actually, looked, like, the, comic, book, guy, on, the, Simpsons., She, almost, canceled, our, "date.", We, met,, had, drinks,, had, dinner,, laughed,, talked,, and,, then,, like, the, decent, upstanding, man, that, I, am,, I, drove, home., A, couple, weeks, later,, she, came, up, to, Sacramento., We've, been, together, since., That, was, almost, three, years, ago, and, everything, is, great,, actually,, better, all, the, time., We, both, travel, and, do, absolutely, nothing, while, together,, and, it, is, seamlessly, great., I, am, now, the, stepfather, of, a, fine, little, dog., She, supports, my, record, buying, mania., It's, the, best, thing, I've, ever, had., I'd, like, to, think, that, "We'll, float, in, space, together...", After, we, got, together,, top, on, my, "must, find", list, was, another, copy, of, Clyde, &, Phyllis., It, took, a, few, months, of, intense, searching, but, I, found, one, in, Chicago., It, had, been, listed, the, day, I, checked, and, bamm, it, was, mine., On, Susan's, next, birthday,, I, gave, it, to, her., She, was, overwhelmed, with, emotion, and, so, was, I., Now, I, know, two, people, with, the, record., About, a, year, latter, I, found, her, a, copy, of, Chicken, Fat,, but, all, that, inspired, was, a, little, dance., That's, cool,, I, like, to, dance,, too.,

his, two, sisters, set, down, in, Manila, as, the, Wanderers, Trio., Occupation, of, the, Philippines, by, the, Japanese, during, World, War, II, broke, up, the, group,, but, Ruben, kept, singing,,

on, enough, of, them, (and, other, Filipino, records), that, I, swore, off, anything, that, originated, from, those, islands, (something, I, am, reconsidering, since, scoring, the, Aguilar, and, then, this). , Aside, from, the, language,, there, is, nothing, remotely, Filipino, about, this, Ruben, Tagalog, record., It, sounds, like, a, very, nice, lounge, record, with, a, very, nice, baritone, and, a, hint, of, exotica., It, has, a, sound, that, is, dated, enough, to, be, romantic., Close, your, eyes, and, imagine, people, dancing, to, this, and, then, realize, that, they'd, be, dead, by, now.,

reflecting, on, not, knowing, who, Lepa, Brena, -, a, Serbian, singer, who, has, sold, more, than, 40, million, albums, -, was, and, that, the, world, is, really, much, bigger, than, we, think, it, is., Well,, here's, one, more, example, of, that., Freddie, Aguilar, is, not, only, the, pop, musician, of, the, Philippines, but, his, importance, crosses, from, culture, to, politics, and, into, the, history, books. , Musically,, Aguilar's, importance, centers, on, two, things., First, is, he, wrote, and, performed, a, song, called, "Anak", (which, is, the, title, cut, of, this, record, and, which, you, can, hear/watch)., "Anak", sold, millions, of, copies, when, it, was, released., It, not, only, lodged, itself, in, the, Philippine, charts, at, number, one,, it, topped, the, charts, in, Japan,, Indonesia,, Malaysia,, and, other, countries, in, Southeast, Asia., There, are, over, 100, versions, of, it, recorded,, in, 23, languages., Number, two:, Prior, to, "Anak"'s, success,, Aguilar, was, one, of, many, artists, associated, with, Pinoy, Rock,, the, Filipino, version, of, rock, &, roll,, which, started, in, the, 1960s, but, really, took, off, in, the, Seventies., Pinoy, Rock, was, to, serve, as, part, of, the, cultural, roots, of, opposition, to, the, dictatorship, of, Ferdinand, Marcos., Politically,, Aguilar, is, important, because, he, is, one, of, the, artists, who, headed, up, opposition, to, Marcos., His, recording, of, the, protest, song, "Bayan, Ko", (with, additional, lyrics, criticizing, Marcos), became, the, anthem, of, the, "People, Power", movement,, which, lead, to, the, peaceful, revolution, which, toppled, Marcos., Aguilar, was, harassed, by, Marco's, henchmen, but, stood, as, a, cultural, icon, against, the, dictatorship,, while, giving, public, support, to, opposition, leaders. , Now, I, didn't, know, any, of, that, before, I, found, this, record,, even, though, I, have, a, goddamn, book, on, Pinoy, Rock, (Punks,, Poets,, and, Poseurs),, a, book, that, I've, read, a, couple, times., And, though, the, book, focuses, mostly, on, the, Pinoy, scene, from, the, mid-Eighties, to, the, Nineties,, Aguilar, is, mentioned., Duh. , As, I've, written, before,, all, of, this, is, a, nice, history, lesson,, but, that, is, all, it, is, if, the, music, doesn't, deliver., Aguilar, does., While, "Anak", is, a, nice, song,, it, is, the, rest, of, the, album, which, I, dig, the, most., Aguilar's, best, stuff, is, quiet,, moody,, and, mildly, psychedelic., It, has, the, feel, of, Danny, Kirwan-era, Fleewood, Mac, mixed, with, a, bit, of, Leonard, Cohen, (music, not, vocals)., When, Aguilar, "rocks,", it, is, a, laid, back, sound,, something, that, is, a, bit, like, a, bluesy, Sir, Douglas, Quintet., It's, really, nice, stuff., #, posted, by, Scott, Soriano, :, 21:19,  0, comments, 12.23.2011, El, Ritmo, Inconfundible, de, Columbia, De, Nuevo, Los, Hispanos, De, Columbia, El, Ritmo, Inconfundible, de, Columbia, LP,

everyone, reading, this, knows, the, story, of, the, evolution, of, Rhythm, &, Blues, from, Black, gospel, music, and, the, secularization, of, church, music, by, Ray, Charles, and, others. , Prior, to, this, break,, along, with, jazz,, gospel, was, the, innovating, force, in, American, music. , However, as, R&B, developed, and, became, Soul, (and, then, Funk),, gospel, lost, its, place, as, the, leader., For, a, while, it, stuck, to, its, sound, and, musically, became, pretty, stagnant., While, people, like, Andre, Crouch, brought, gospel, much, commercial, success, and, a, wider, audience,, musically, there's, been, no, one, on, par, with, James, Brown,, Sly, Stone,, George, Clinton,, Prince,, Quincy, Jones,, etc., But, what, there, has, been, are, moments,, reactions, to, whatever, sound, was, reverberating, in, Soul., In, the, Seventies,, gospel, funk, takes, hold., Vernard, Johnson, pioneered, gospel, sax,, with, sounds, that,, at, times,, echoed, Albert, Ayler., Later,, gospel, rap, took, hold., Between, gospel, funk, and, gospel, rap,, there, was, another, reaction, happening., That, was, gospel's, response, to, modern, soul,, i.e., the, music, of, Prince,, Cameo,, Rick, James,, Lakeside,, Gap, Band,, Zapp,, etc., For, the, random, music, fan,, this, is, not, a, genre, I, recommend, jumping, into., Like, modern, soul,, the, gospel, reaction, has, a, much, higher, miss, ratio, to, the, hits. , Though, there, are, great, songs, in, the, genre,, I, have, yet, to, find, an, album, as, back-to-back, great, as, Zapp, II, or, Price, 1999., Nothing, close, to, Cameo's, Knights, of, the, Sound, Table, or, Rick, James, Street, Songs., Could, be, lurking, out, there, but, I, haven't, come, upon, it., I, have, found, the, mod, gospel, equivalent, of, Gap, Band, 8 , and, the, Mary, Jane, Girls, LP, (unfortunately, in, quality, not, content!)., But, I, have, found, a, handful, of, really, great, songs., Take, the, title, cut, from, Carey, Foster's, (only?), album, Somewhere, Along, the, Line., Backed, by, keyboard, and, drum, machine,, hanging, on, a, single, riff,, Foster's, "Somewhere...", sounds, like, it, came, from, the, studio, of, Sly, Stone, (think, Little, Sister)., And, check, out, the, backing, vocal, aping, Sly's, guitar, before, engaging, in, some, killer, singing., Foster, goes, between, sing, talking, and, gospel, wailing, with, perfection., Listen, to, this, a, couple, times, in, a, row, and, you'll, be, bouncing, up, and, down,, trying, to, sing, along, with, the, background, singers., Great, song., Unfortunately,, nothing, else, like, it, on, the, album. , #, posted, by, Scott, Soriano, :, 17:19,  0, comments, 9.03.2011, Radio, Playlist, for, 08.30.11, Skeleton, Crew, The, Border, [Rift] , If, -, Then, -, Else, Hey,
