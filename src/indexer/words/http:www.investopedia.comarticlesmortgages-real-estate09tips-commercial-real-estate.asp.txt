—, 11:10, AM, EST, Share, Ask, any, real, estate, professional, about, the, benefits, of, investing, in, commercial, property,, and, you'll, likely, trigger, a, monologue, on, how, such, properties, are, a, better, deal, than, residential, real, estate., Commercial, property, owners, love, the, additional, cash, flow,, the, beneficial, economies, of, scale,, the, relatively, open, playing,

also, see, a, bigger, cash, flow, with, commercial, property., The, math, is, simple:, you'll, earn, more, income, on, multifamily, dwellings,, for, instance,, than, on, a, single-family, home., Know, also, that, commercial, property, leases, are, longer, than, on, single-family, residences., That, paves, the, way, for, greater, cash, flow., Lastly,, if, you're, in, a, tighter, credit, environment,, make, sure, to, come, knocking, with, cash, in, hand., Commercial, property, lenders, like, to, see, at, least, 30%, down, before, they'll, give, a, loan, the, green, light., Map, Out, a, Plan, of, Action, Setting, parameters, is, a, top, priority, in, a, commercial, real, estate, deal., For, example,, ask, yourself, how, much, can, you, afford, to, pay, and, then, shop, around, for, mortgages, to, get, a, sense, of, how, much, you, will, pay, over, the, life, of, the, mortgage., Using, tools, like, mortgage, calculators, can, help, you, develop, good, estimates, of, the, total, cost, of, your, home., Other, key, questions, to, ask, yourself, include:, How, much, do, you, expect, to, make, on, the, deal?, Who, are, the, key, players?, How, many, tenants, are, already,

are, used, to, estimate, the, net, present, value, of, future, profits, or, cash, flow;, the, process, is, also, called, capitalization, of, earnings., Cash, on, Cash, Commercial, real, estate, investors, who, rely, on, financing, to, purchase, their, properties, often, adhere, to, the, cash-on-cash, formula, to, compare, the, first-year, performance, of, competing, properties., Cash-on-cash, takes, the, fact, that, the, investor, in, question, doesn't, require, 100%, cash, to, buy, the, property, into, account,, but, also, accounts, for, the, fact, that, the, investor, will, not, keep, all, of, the, NOI, because, he, or, she, must, use, some, of, it, to, make, mortgage, payments., To, uncover, cash, on, cash,, real, estate, investors, must, determine, the, amount,

them, -, specifically, those, who, are, ready, and, eager, to, sell, below, market, value., The, fact, is, that, nothing, happens, -, or, even, matters, -, in, real, estate, until, you, find, a, deal,, which, is, usually, accompanied, by, a, motivated, seller., This, is, someone, with, a, pressing, reason, to, sell, below, market, value., If, your, seller, isn't, motivated,, he, or, she, won't, be, as, willing, to, negotiate., Discover, the, Fine, Art, of, Neighborhood, "Farming", An, excellent, way, to, evaluate, a, commercial, property, is, to, study, the, neighborhood, it's, located, in, by, going, to, open, houses,, talking, to, other, neighborhood, owners,, and, looking, for, vacancies., Use, a, "Three-Pronged", Approach, to, Evaluate, Properties, Be, adaptable, when, searching, for, great, deals., Use, the, internet,, read, the, classified, ads, and, hire, bird, dogs, to, find, you, the, best, properties., Real, estate, bird, dogs, can, help, you, find, valuable, investment, leads, in, exchange, for, a, referral, fee., The, Bottom, Line, By, and, large,, finding, and, evaluating, commercial, properties, is, not, just, about, farming, neighborhoods,, getting, a, great, price,, or, sending, out, smoke, signals, to, bring, sellers, to, you., At, the, heart, of, taking, action, is, basic, human, communication., It's, about, building, relationships, and,
