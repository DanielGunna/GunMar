[Rob's, Movie, Vault, Louis, C.K., 2017, Posted, April, 9,, 2017, by, Rob, Gonsalves, Categories:, comedy,, concert, film,, Uncategorized, In, his, new,, simply, titled, concert, film, Louis, C.K., 2017,, the, eponymous, comedian, doesn’t, waste, any, time, with, pre-concert, sketches., He, just, gets, right, into, it:, “So, I, think, abortion, is,, um,, here’s, what, I, think,”, Louis, begins,, and, the, audience, guffaws, knowingly., A, lot, of, what, Louis, C.K., says, is, in, quotes, —, “Here’s, what, a, clueless, white, guy, sounds, like”, is, the, unspoken, preface,, followed, by, an, observation, along, the, lines, of , “I’m, not, condoning, rape,, obviously, —, you, should, never, rape, anyone., Unless, you, have, a, reason,, like, if, you, want, to, fuck, somebody, and, they, won’t, let, you.”, The, point,, to, an, intelligent, audience,, is, that, there, isn’t, a, reason;, Louis, also, lays, down, a, level, of, satire, of, self-justifying, rhetoric., So, when, Louis, steers, his, abortion, bit, into, a, statement, that, “women, should, have, the, right, to, kill, babies,”, the, bit, becomes, more, about, the, irreconcilable,, eternally, warring, language, used, in, the, abortion, debate, than, about, abortion, itself., Louis, C.K., 2017, finds, Louis, in, his, usual, amiably, schlubby, but, seriously, askew, conflict, with, life, —, a, concept, that, gets, no, respect, from, him:, the, abortion, material, more, or, less, ends, with, Louis, saying, that, life, is, overrated, anyway., (Another, bit, has, him, musing, about, suicide, in, a, way, that, falls, on, neither, side, of, that, topic.), He, wears, a, suit, this, time, out,, as, he, also, did, in, his, opening, monologue, on, last, weekend’s, Saturday, Night, Live., Has, he, grown, up,, or, sold, out?, Louis, has, shed, his, typical, working, uniform, —, a, black, t-shirt, and, jeans, —, in, favor, of, an, outfit, that, more, effectively, points, up, his, opinions, as, those, of, a, goofy, white, dude., Louis, treats, his, insights, as, throwaways;, an, unimpressed, Generation, X, elder, (born, in, 1967),, he, doesn’t, buy, into, anything, as, the, one, way, to, look, at, the, world,, much, less, his, own, view., His, bit, about, how, Christianity, “won”, —, pointing, to, the, very, fact, of, the, numerical, year, we, all, agree, on, whether, or, not, we’re, believers, (hence, the, title, of, the, special,, I, guess), —, is, less, confrontational, than, just, bewildered., The, broader, his, reach,, the, more, timeless, his, comments,, the, closer, he, gets, to, being, his, generation’s, George, Carlin., But, then, he’ll, take, it, back, down, to, muddy, earth,, to, the, grimy, and, personal,, linking, him, to, Richard, Pryor., Yet, he, comes, off, as, an, original;, he, doesn’t, ape, Carlin, or, Pryor, so, much, as, earn, the, right, to, be, included, with, them, in, conversations, about, American, comedy., A, good, chunk, of, Louis’, material, can, be, taken, as, depressing., Love,, he, says,, is, nice, but, doesn’t, last;, he, even, leaves, out, the, usual, bromide, about, how, the, finest, things, don’t, last,, which, is, why, they’re, the, finest, things., I, suppose, we, can, infer, that,, but, that, would, violate, Louis’, particular, defeated, weltschmerz., Carlin, was, angry;, Pryor, was, afraid;, Louis, is, just,, like,, whatever,, this, all, sucks, (another, generational, thing)., There’s, a, cap,, though,, on, how, cynical, a, creative, person, can, get, —, especially, one, operating, at, the, level, of, Louis, C.K.,, who, in, recent, years, has, evolved, from, a, comedian’s, comedian, to, someone, who, can, sell, out, Madison, Square, Garden., He, has, achieved,, in, this, degraded, pop, culture,, the, rare, distinction, of, being, both, artistically, respected, and, wildly, popular., So, how, does, someone, whose, shtick, rests, on, himself, being, a, skeevy, bum, (but, hilariously, honest, about, his, bummy, skeeviness), respond, to, being, loved, by, his, peers, and, by, the, masses?, (Well,, maybe, not, all, his, peers, —, there, are, still, various, allegations, of, gross, behavior, in, front, of, female, comedians, he, has, to, contend, with.), On, the, evidence, of, Louis, C.K., 2017,, he, just, continues, doing, what, he’s, been, doing., He, can, do, five, minutes, on, the, most, piddly-ass, thing,, and, then, tie, it, into, a, coherent, (though, frumpy), filter, on, the, world., The, subtext, of, his, more, outrageous, bits, is, “Yeah,, listen, while, this, scuzzy, idiot, presumes, to, tell, you, what, he, thinks, about, [fill, in, the, blank],”, which, is, why, his, opening, sentence, about, abortion, gets, a, big, laugh, even, though, it, doesn’t, read, funny, on, paper., A, consummate, actor,, as, proven, on, his, dazzling, and, much-lamented, FX, show, Louie,, he, can, give, the, impression, that, his, act, isn’t, honed, and, perfected, over, the, course, of, dozens, of, gigs, but, just, a, guy, riffing, off, the, top, of, his, head., As, mopey, as, his, material, can, get,, the, fact, that, Louis, C.K., can, work, at, his, level, and, be, successful, is, one, reason, to, stay, optimistic., Comments:, Be, the, first, to, comment, Silence, Posted, April, 2,, 2017, by, Rob, Gonsalves, Categories:, adaptation,, drama,, one, of, the, year's, best,, underrated, Silence, is, very, likely, the, most, Catholic, movie, Martin, Scorsese, has, ever, made,, which, makes, it, very, Catholic, indeed, —, mega-Catholic,, über-Catholic., It’s, a, real, high, mass, of, a, film,, done, with, high, craft, in, the, highest, seriousness., I’m, seriously, divided, on, it,, but, ultimately, I, have, to, lean, in, its, favor., I, feel, protective, of, it,, as, if, it, were, a, pencil, sketch, or, a, mandala., Pain, and, guilt, radiate, from, every, frame,, alongside, incongruous, natural, beauty., I’m, not, sure, if, it’s, a, work, of, art, or, a, tract, of, instruction,, and, certainly, it, couldn’t, be, less, interested, in, reflecting, the, concerns, of, the, day, or, satisfying, the, commercial, cravings, of, the, day., Like, Scorsese’s, The, Last, Temptation, of, Christ,, it’s, timeless, and, placeless;, its, true, milieu, is, inside, Scorsese’s, head., The, climate, in, Last, Temptation, was, red, and, dusty;, the, one, in, Silence,, 17th-century, Japan,, feels, cold, and, wet,, shot, by, master, cinematographer, Rodrigo, Prieto, in, infinite, gradations, of, blue, and, gray,, yet, never, feeling, desaturated., The, mood, is, frightened, but, determined, spirituality, in, the, face, of, violent, oppression., Christianity, in, this, land, is, punishable, by, torture, and, death,, unless, the, accused, voluntarily, steps, on, an, image, of, Christ,, thus, signaling, their, renunciation, of, God,, their, apostasy., (We, hear, the, word, “apostatize”, in, this, film, about, as, often, as, we, hear, a, certain, other, word, in, Scorsese’s, gangster, films.), Two, Portuguese, Jesuit, priests,, Rodrigues, (Andrew, Garfield), and, Garrupe, (Adam, Driver),, volunteer, to, sneak, into, Japan, to, look, for, their, former, mentor, Father, Ferreira, (Liam, Neeson),, who, is, said, to, have, apostatized., They, find, a, blue,, rainy, place, haunted, by, terrified, Japanese, Christians, and, the, stone-faced, samurai, who, hunt, them., The, problem, with, Scorsese’s, alter, egos, in, his, movies, about, faith, is, that, they,, for, him,, are, filled, out, with, his, own, guilt, and, devotion., The, rest, of, us, may, perceive, these, heroes, as, somewhat, hollow,, undefined., Andrew, Garfield, does, what, he, can,, but, Rodrigues, is, drawn, as, a, bit, too, much, of, a, noble, sufferer,, only, intermittently, aware, that, his, steadfast, refusal, to, apostatize, might, have, more, to, do, with, his, pride, than, with, any, genuine, love, of, God., Fortunately,, Scorsese, acknowledges, this,, and, throws, some, of, our, identification, to, a, few, of, the, Japanese, characters., There’s, Kichijiro, (Yōsuke, Kubozuka),, a, Judas, stand-in, who’s, also, the, mad, fool, of, the, piece,, always, moving, between, sacrifice, and, betrayal;, or, Mokichi, (Shinya, Tsukamoto,, bad-boy, director, of, Tetsuo, the, Iron, Man, and, many, others),, a, devout, old, Christian;, or, especially, Inquisitor, Inoue, (Issey, Ogata,, whose, voice, is, one, of, the, most, amazing, purrs, of, self-satisfied, evil, I’ve, ever, heard, in, a, movie)., Given, that, the, priests, are, so, devoted, to, their, faith, they, sometimes, seem, completely, out, of, touch, with, reality,, and, given, that, Scorsese, lets, the, Japanese, have, humor, and, complexity, —, humanity, —, I, don’t, think, Silence, can, be, waved, off, as, white-saviorism., Scorsese, sees, the, problem, with, all-or-nothing, thinking, on, either, side., Technically,, Silence, is, a, Michelin, three-star, restaurant., Emotionally, it’s, impacted,, uncertain;, Scorsese, never, met, a, doubt, he, didn’t, love, to, chew, over., Sometimes, it, seems, his, real, subject, all, along, has, been, faith, darkening, into, doubt, and, then, brightening, back, towards, faith,, and, on, and, on, eternally., Paradise,, says, a, woman, in, the, film,, is, a, place, with, no, suffering, and, no, work, (and, no, taxes,, she, adds),, but, what, kind, of, drama, is, that?, As, David, Byrne, said,, heaven, is, a, place, where, nothing, ever, happens., For, Scorsese,, it’s, all, about, the, struggle,, which, for, him, is, the, tension, between, religious, asceticism, and, the, visceral,, sensual, pleasure, he, derives, from, cinema, —, watching, it, and, making, it., His, movies, about, faith, tend, to, end, more, or, less, happily, because, the, end, of, a, film, means, that, a, film, has, been, made., The, famous, cliché, about, Scorsese, is, that, the, movie, theater, is, his, church, and, vice, versa., Silence, is, an, interiorized, work, surrounded, by,, almost, mocked, by,, flesh-punishing, yet, ravishingly, gorgeous, nature., In, that, respect, it’s, as, Catholic, as, the, blood, flowing, through, Scorsese’s, veins, and, his, emulsion., Comments:, Be, the, first, to, comment, The, Transfiguration, Posted, March, 26,, 2017, by, Rob, Gonsalves, Categories:, art-house,, horror, Milo, (Eric, Ruffin),, the, African-American, teenager, whose, struggles, animate, The, Transfiguration,, is, enamored, of, vampire, movies., He, has, a, stash, of, them, on, videotape, in, his, bedroom, closet,, and, he, prefers, the, “realistic”, ones, —, like, George, Romero’s, Martin, or, Tomas, Alfredson’s, Let, the, Right, One, In., Milo, might, also, enjoy, The, Transfiguration,, because, it,, too,, is, realistic, —, vampires, don’t, burn, in, sunlight,, and, they, definitely, don’t, sparkle., They, just, go, around, preying, on, the, vulnerable,, punching, a, hole, in, their, carotid, arteries, and, slurping, up, the, gore., When, I, say, “they,”, though,, I, really, only, mean, Milo,, in, the, literal, sense., The, movie, is, full, of, metaphorical, bloodsuckers,, stealers, of, innocence,, abusers, and, sociopaths., Such, is, life, in, New, York, City., Since, the, movie, isn’t, religious, at, all, —, Milo, would, no, doubt, be, unaffected, by, a, crucifix, or, holy, water, if, they, were, used, against, him, —, one, might, wonder, why, writer-director, Michael, O’Shea, titled, it, The, Transfiguration,, other, than, that, it, sounded, cool, and, dark., Nobody, is, really, transfigured, here, in, the, Christian, sense,, although, some, might, say, the, movie, itself, transfigures, schlock, into, art., It’s, funny, about, vampire, films, —, they, lean, into, the, artsy, mode,, the, elegant, and, the, expressionist,, far, more, easily, than,, say,, werewolf, films, or, zombie, films., Just, recently, we, had, Jim, Jarmusch’s, Only, Lovers, Left, Alive, and, Ana, Lily, Amirpour’s, A, Girl, Walks, Home, Alone, at, Night,, and, O’Shea’s, film, joins, their, number,, reveling, in, the, glum, goth, mood,, the, awkward, silences,, the, gurgle, of, blood, in, the, dark., Milo, meets, a, newcomer, to, his, building, —, Sophie, (Chloe, Levine),, an, abused, girl, almost, as, affectless, as, Milo, is,, though, she’s, quicker, to, laugh., Milo, is, almost, always, clenched, and, blank-faced,, but, around, Chloe, he, loosens, up, a, bit., For, a, while,, hanging, out, or, watching, violent, videos,, they, seem, well-matched,, one’s, psychological/emotional, blank, spots, complementing, the, other’s., Milo’s, even, more, dour, older, brother, Lewis, (Aaron, Clifton, Moten),, an, Army, veteran,, is, at, least, happy, to, see, Milo, comfortable, around, someone,, even, if, she’s, a, white, girl., That, fact, makes, Milo, even, more, of, an, object, of, derision, for, the, local, gang,, who, enjoy, tormenting, him., Milo’s, connection, with, the, gang, doesn’t, end, up, where, you’d, expect, it, to, in, a, vampire, film,, and, his, relationship, with, Sophie, doesn’t,, either., The, Transfiguration, is, bound, to, be, called, a, cross, between, Martin, and, Moonlight,, though, it’s, not, as, erotic, as, those, films., What, it, seems, to, have, under, the, hood, is, something, about, how, inhuman, conditions, can, produce, inhuman, people, (or,, as, Stephen, King, would, put, it,, “this, inhuman, place, makes, human, monsters”);, almost, everyone, we, see, exists, in, some, spiritually, null, zone., There, might, also, be, something, about, how, black, teenage, males, are, demonized,, made, the, monsters, of, the, media, narrative., Milo, might, be, the, result, of, generations, of, neglect, benign, and, not-so-benign., He, doesn’t, seem, to, have, much, race, consciousness,, though., He’s, too, deeply, into, his, vampire, fixation, —, like, Martin,, he, believes, he, is, one,, so, in, terms, of, effect, he, pretty, much, is, one., The, performances, are, uniformly, natural, and, unaffected;, O’Shea, understands, that, quiet, desperation, speaks, louder, than, hysteria., (He, also, has, the, wit, to, give, cameos, to, Troma, schlockmeister, Lloyd, Kaufman, and, art-house, horror, auteur, Larry, Fessenden,, whose, disparate, styles, influence, this, film’s.), People, will, sit, together, on, the, side, of, the, wide, frame,, isolated, yet, united., The, compositions, are, thoughtful,, though, always, a, little, jiggly., O’Shea, takes, his, time, and, creates, an, allusive, atmosphere, whose, meanings, are, up, for, grabs., The, Transfiguration, could, have, snapped, into, sharper, focus;, it, remains, a, bit, thematically, diffuse,, a, little, underdone., But, at, its, most, haunting, it, earns, its, place, in, that, bedroom, closet, next, to, Martin, and, the, rest., Comments:, Be, the, first, to, comment, The, Assignment, Posted, March, 19,, 2017, by, Rob, Gonsalves, Categories:, art-house,, film, noir,, thriller, Watching, Another, 48, HRS, on, TV, recently, with, the, sound, off,, for, some, reason,, I, found, myself, drawn, into, the, movement,, the, colors,, the, cinema., That, movie, is, a, lazy,, stupid, sequel,, certainly, not, the, finest, hour, of, its, director,, Walter, Hill., But, Hill, is, a, visual, samurai,, and, for, a, few, minutes, I, just, let, myself, coast, on, the, smooth,, feral, images., Hill’s, latest,, the, controversial, pulp, thriller, The, Assignment,, has, a, few, moments, like, that., Too, few., An, alarming, chunk, of, it, amounts, to, two, people, in, a, room, swapping, stiff, dialogue., Given, the, advance, anti-buzz, —, the, very, premise, an, affront, to, the, struggle, of, transgender, people, —, I, was, anticipating, a, good, crappy, time,, a, low-rent, guilty, pleasure,, but, the, sad, truth, is, it’s, too, dull, to, be, offensive., Hill, is, only, as, good, as, his, script,, and, this, one,, which, he, and, collaborator, Denis, Hamill, tinkered, with, for, years,, doesn’t, do, him, any, favors., A, hitman,, Frank, Kitchen,, a, lithe, and, scowling, fellow, with, a, beard,, kills, a, lowlife, who, turns, out, to, be, the, brother, of, an, insane, plastic, surgeon, (Sigourney, Weaver)., The, surgeon, has, her, revenge, by, having, Frank, abducted, and, brought, to, her, operating, table;, before, long,, Frank, looks, like, Michelle, Rodriguez,, with, the, accompanying, lady, parts,, and, of, course, without, his, former, man, parts., I, say, “his”, because, Frank, is, not, transgender;, he, had, gender, reassignment, surgery, without, his, consent,, so, the, use, of, trans-friendly, pronouns, doesn’t, quite, apply, here., What, we, have, here, isn’t, truly, transphobic., It’s, really, more, of, a, gendernaut, rewrite, of, Hill’s, 1989, Johnny, Handsome., In, both, films,, the, assumption, is, that, surgery, to, change, a, scoundrel’s, appearance, will, also, change, his, heart;, Weaver’s, cracked, surgeon, sounds, almost, the, same, as, Forest, Whitaker’s, much, more, altruistic, sawbones, in, Johnny, Handsome., In, this, case,, it’s, presumed, that, changing, macho,, cold-hearted, Frank, into, a, woman, outwardly, will, also, make, him, inwardly, more, feminine,, less, violent., Of, course,, the, surgeon, is, also, a, woman,, and, she’s, fairly, cold, and, has, no, trouble, getting, thugs, to, do, her, psychotic, bidding., Unpacking, this, movie, for, what, it, might, say, about, gender, will, only, result, in, clutter., It’s, basically, noir:, people, don’t, change;, people, can’t, change., Towards, the, end,, as, Frank, slaughters, his, way, closer, to, the, surgeon,, Hill’s, casual, mastery, of, violence, kicks, The, Assignment, into, gear., It’s, cheaply, done,, and, it’s, depressingly, clear, that, Hill’s, days, of, having, budgets, like, the, ones, he, had, for, 48, HRS, or, Southern, Comfort, are, long, behind, him., But, there’s, some, snappy, brutality., It, doesn’t, make, up, for, the, talkiness,, though,, or, Hill’s, habit, of, using, corny, scene, transitions,, or, the, highly, expendable, subplot, involving, Frank, and, a, comely, but, unethical, nurse, (Caitlin, Gerard)., Hill, was, enamored, of, the, film’s, premise, for, decades,, but, he, never, made, the, premise, into, a, movie., Weaver,, sitting, in, a, straitjacket,, talks, to, shrink, Tony, Shalhoub, for, what, seems, like, a, lifetime,, and, talks, and, talks,, and, every, time, Hill, goes, back, to, this, room, and, these, two,, we, tap, our, feet, and, wait, for, the, film, to, get, started, again., Weaver, tries, for, some, Dr., Lecter, sangfroid, in, bringing, this, arrogantly, arch, character, to, life,, but, it’s, a, monotonous,, unsmiling, performance, from, a, usually, good-humored, actor., Rodriguez, looks, for, something, real, in, this, pulp, universe, and, fails,, falling, back, into, her, sullen, default, mode., Walter, Hill, turned, this, material, into, a, French, graphic, novel, before, he, made, the, movie,, and, the, movie, has, the, same, gritty,, debauched, tone, as, a, European, comics, album, for, adults, only., The, acting, needed, to, be, heightened,, the, dialogue, cruel, and, sharp, as, a, shiv., There, aren’t, even, quotable, lines, or, amusing, turns, of, phrase., The, transgender, community, has, far, worse, things, to, fear, and, rage, against, than, this, pallid, exercise., Walter, Hill, alone, may, know, why, he, still, wanted, to, make, this, movie;, the, rest, of, us, won’t, know, from, watching, it., Comments:, Be, the, first, to, comment, Who’s, Crazy?, Posted, March, 12,, 2017, by, Rob, Gonsalves, Categories:, art-house, Once, upon, a, time,, an, American, filmmaker, in, Belgium, happened, across, a, group, of, other, Americans., The, group, were, members, of, New, York’s, experimental, Living, Theatre,, whose, founders, (Julian, Beck, and, Judith, Molina), were, back, in, the, States, doing, time, for, tax, evasion., While, waiting, for, their, spiritual, father, and, mother, to, arrive,, the, Theatre, people, herded, into, a, deserted, farmhouse, along, with, the, filmmaker, —, Thomas, White, —, and, created, Who’s, Crazy?,, a, barely, feature-length, attempt, shown, at, a, couple, of, festivals, and, then, considered, lost, for, decades., During, that, time, it, was, known,, if, at, all,, among, jazz, scholars, because, of, its, soundtrack, by, Ornette, Coleman., Finally,, in, 2015, a, print, of, the, film, was, found, in, White’s, garage.  ,     , Like, Coleman’s, score, —, performed, while, Coleman, and, his, collaborators, watched, the, film, —, the, action, in, Who’s, Crazy?, is, largely, improvised., We, begin, aboard, a, bus, transporting, a, bunch, of, mental, patients., The, bus, breaks, down,, an, inmate, escapes,, and, while, two, guards, chase, after, him,, the, rest, of, the, inmates, break, free, and, crowd, into, the, farmhouse,, where, they, enact, various, scenarios, meant, to, illuminate, or, satirize, societal, tropes, (trial,, marriage,, communal, meals)., Sometimes, the, inmates, chant, or, emit, barbaric, yawps;, other, times, they, speak, in, solemn, theater, jive., Most, often,, the, harried,, lunging, music,, a, boomerang, spinning, towards, discovery,, speaks, for, them.  ,     , Modern, viewers, might, have, fun, imposing, connections, between, this, and, earlier, or, later, works., It, definitely, shares, DNA, with, Marat/Sade,, King, of, Hearts,, The, Idiots,, and, The, Ninth, Configuration,, not, to, mention, the, Living, Theatre’s, own, The, Brig., One, actor,, bearded, and, saturnine,, could, be, a, brother, to, Oscar, Isaac, in, Inside, Llewyn, Davis;, the, cast, in, general, shares, that, hipster, aura., We’re, always, aware, that, we’re, watching, a, performance, —, the, movie, doesn’t, make, us, enter, into, the, imaginative, contract,, where, we, agree, to, accept, the, shown, events, as, “real.”, White’s, camera, meanders, or, stares, at, a, man, numbly, applying, greasepaint,, prefiguring, Lance, the, acid-head, surfer, smearing, camo, grease, on, his, face, in, Apocalypse, Now.,   ,     , What, makes, Who’s, Crazy?, more, than, a, curiosity,, a, relic, from, the, noble-lunatic, era, of, Leary, and, Laing,, is, its, spirit, of, play, —, the, actors, are, reaching, for, truth,, ecstasy,, life, in, death., All, very, po-faced, and, pompous,, but, fun, to, take, in, small, doses, (here, and, there, it, reminded, me, of, some, of, the, elliptical, little, theatrical, whimsies, Edward, Gorey, used, to, put, on, in, Cape, Cod)., Like, a, lot, of, contemporaneous, avant, garde, cinema,, the, movie, is, a, result, of, shooting, for, hours, and, then, manhandling, it, into, some, sort, of, order, in, the, editing, room., There’s, a, loose, narrative, with, some, cross-cutting, creating, what, we, read, as, subplots., Ultimately, it, comments, on, its, own, medium, —, experimental, narrative, often, staggers, towards, postmodernism., Maybe, two, or, three, characters, take, turns, owning, the, film, simply, because, they, get, more, screen, time;, we, might, feel, there, are, equally, prominent, characters, littering, the, cutting-room, floor., Even, avant, garde, in, 1965, has, its, limits:, no, women, or, black, actors, (there, are, a, few, seen, here), assume, the, center.  ,     , I, value, this, work, more, than, I, value,, say,, E., Elias, Merhige’s, grimly, archetypal, Begotten, (1989), because, it, revels, so, cheerfully, in, its, own, nonsense,, and, the, illogic, consorts, organically, and, gorgeously, with, those, Coleman, riffs., (The, only, other, movie, Coleman, scored, was, David, Cronenberg’s, Naked, Lunch,, and, Who’s, Crazy?, at, times, feels, like, one, of, Cronenberg’s, early,, intimate, shorts.), There’s, something, fascist-apocalyptic, about, the, movie’s, milieu,, a, cold, foggy, place, where, wild, innocents, are, pursued, by, bears, with, badges,, but, within, that, context, the, Living, Theatre, people, celebrate, and, exult., (Apparently, Mom, and, Dad, didn’t, much, care, for, the, result:, Julian, Beck, sniffed, that, the, movie, was, false, to, the, Theatre’s, “energy, vector.”), Owing, as, much, to, silent, comedy, as, to, hip, new, notions, of, confrontational, drama,, Who’s, Crazy?, pleases, by, its, very, inability, to, please, in, a, conventional, sense., It, gives, the, people, what, they, want,, though, —, conflict,, thrills,, love,, music,, song, —, just, not, in, the, usual, package., Known, for, its, jazz,, it’s, pretty, jazzy, itself,, and, ends, up, being, a, more, potent, tribute, to, that, musical, form, than, a, certain, recent, musical, that, won, a, few, Oscars., Comments:, Be, the, first, to, comment, They, Call, Me Jeeg, Posted, March, 5,, 2017, by, Rob, Gonsalves, Categories:, drama,, fantasy,, foreign, The, grimly, realistic, Roman, superhero, drama, They, Call, Me, Jeeg,, which, swept, the, Italian, equivalent, of, the, Oscars, last, year, and, will, soon, open, in, America,, doesn’t, put, any, particular, emphasis, on, its, feats, of, power, and, heroism., They, just, happen,, in, a, gray-blue, gunmetal, world,, and, sometimes, they, go, viral, on, YouTube., The, title,, perhaps, bewildering, to, some,, refers, to, a, 1975, Japanese, anime, called, Steel, Jeeg., The, protagonist,, career, thief, Enzo, Ceccotti, (Claudio, Santamaria),, falls, into, a, submerged, barrel, of, toxic, waste, and, emerges, with, heightened, strength, and, healing, powers., Alessia, (Ilenia, Pastorelli),, the, mentally, unstable, daughter, of, one, of, Enzo’s, associates,, is, obsessed, with, Steel, Jeeg, and, sees, the, newly, super, Enzo, as, her, long-awaited, Jeeg., At, first,, though,, Enzo, does, nothing, more, noble, with, his, gifts, than,, say,, ripping, off, an, ATM., And, when, I, say, “ripping, off, an, ATM,”, I, mean, he, literally, rips, it, off, of, a, building., In, a, movie, like, this,, special, effects, are, used, in, a, matter-of-fact, way,, and, it, often, leads, to, strange,, memorable, details;, in, a, Marvel, or, DC, superhero, movie,, for, instance,, you, won’t, hear, the, unique, hollow, thud-thud, of, a, shoe, being, shaken, with, a, severed, toe, rattling, around, inside, it., You’ll, hear, it, in, They, Call, Me, Jeeg,, for, sure., But, you’ll, also, see, things, like, Enzo, making, a, ferris, wheel, turn, with, his, bare, hands, to, cheer, up, Alessia,, who’s, in, one, of, the, cabins, —, it’s, a, nicely, understated, but, still, grandly, romantic, moment., The, severed, toe, belongs,, or, belonged,, to, Enzo,, who, has, already, healed, from, gunshots, and, now, assumes, he, can, simply, duct-tape, the, toe, back, onto, its, little, stump, and, wait, for, the, flesh, and, bone, to, meld., What, happens, the, following, day, is, a, deadpan, sick, joke,, and, it, establishes, that, this, slice, of, fantasy, in, a, grubby, real, world, has, its, limits., Enzo, can’t, fly,, for, example,, but, he, can, survive, long, falls,, though, even, then, he, rises, slowly, and, has, to, shake, off, the, effects, of, the, impact., Even, a, stubbly, superhero, like, Enzo, needs, a, supervillain,, and, he, gets, one, in, the, form, of, Fabio, (Luca, Marinelli),, a, manic, and, preening, young, gangster, who, relishes, the, theater, of, evildoing., Fabio, fancies, himself, a, singer, and, used, to, be, on, Italy’s, version, of, Big, Brother., He’s, always, holding, rallies, in, his, head,, and, the, numbers, are, tremendous., At, first, I, thought, Marinelli’s, performance, was, cringe-worthy,, but, soon, realized, he, was, playing, a, scared, kid, playing, a, bad-ass, —, putting, layers, of, identity, on, the, character., His, flashy, corruption, runs, counter, to, the, cracked, innocence, of, Alessia;, Ilenia, Pastorelli, makes, her, a, shattered, girl, stronger, in, the, broken, places,, with, a, fantasist’s, desperately, escapist, zeal., The, acting, in, They, Call, Me, Jeeg, is, far, better, than, it, needed, to, be,, sharper, and, respectful, of, people’s, complexities, and, need, to, see, themselves, as, the, center, of, their, stories., The, movie, sneaks, up, and, bounces, some, satirical, riffs, off, of, the, nature, of, fame, in, the, selfie/YouTube/Instagram, culture., The, climax, involves, cobwebbed, tropes, like, the, ticking, bomb, and, the, antagonists, facing, off, one, last,, big, time., But, director, Gabriele, Mainetti, dials, down, the, traditional, histrionics,, and, we, end, up, thinking, more, about, the, people, involved., On, some, level,, They, Call, Me, Jeeg, walks, the, same, path, as, previous, überschmuck, films, like, Super,, Defendor,, Ichi, the, Killer,, and, Chronicle., But, it, also, comments, on, its, own, genre, in, a, way, that, those, films, more, or, less, didn’t., The, characters’, imaginations, have, been, fed, by, the, same, pop, culture, that, feeds, ours;, everyone, acts, the, roles, of, the, people, they, would, like, to, be,, but, we, see, the, cracks, in, the, façades., Those, cracks, fuel, the, tensions, of, the, film, far, more, than, punches, or, explosions, do., Comments:, Be, the, first, to, comment, Oscar, Night, 2017, Posted, February, 27,, 2017, by, Rob, Gonsalves, Categories:, oscars,, Uncategorized, The, most, enduring, image, of, last, Sunday’s, Academy, Awards, ceremony, will, not, be, that, of, a, tearful,, grateful, recipient, of, the, golden, bald, man., Nor, will, it, be, clips, from, any, of, the, winning, films., No,, the, picture, that, will, persist, for, many, years,, haunting, the, nightmares, of, every, future, producer, of, the, Oscars, show,, will, of, course, be, the, shot, of, a, card, held, aloft, —, a, card, pronouncing, Moonlight, the, Best, Picture, winner, instead, of, the, erroneously, announced, La, La, Land., This, was,, globally,, perhaps, not, a, significant, moment,, but, in, the, context, of, Oscar, Night, it, was, seismic., People, from, La, La, Land, had, time, to, get, up, onstage, and, begin, their, acceptance, speeches,, for, fuck’s, sake,, before, the, error, was, clarified, and, made, known., Even, a, Moonlight, booster, and, La, La, Land, detractor, like, myself, couldn’t, help, but, feel, a, twinge, of, pity, for, the, hard-working, creatives, whose, dream, had, been, so, decisively, and, publicly, ripped, away., Well,, drama, and, excitement, were, things, the, Oscars, had, been, missing, for, too, many, years,, and, here, were, drama, and, excitement,, all, right., It, was, nice, to, see, that, the, ceremony, was, still, capable, of, surprise,, albeit, accidental., After, all,, La, La, Land, was, considered, the, favorite, to, sweep,, the, flagbearer, for, the, Magic, of, Movies, and, the, Beauty, of, Artistic, Dreams., The, irony, is, that, while, La, La, Land, paid, fawning, lip, service, to, those, qualities,, Moonlight, actually, embodied, them,, finding, poetry, in, despair., That, it, not, only, won, but, literally, wrested, victory, from, the, jaws, of, defeat, will, only, add, luster, to, the, narrative, of, the, little, movie, that, could., Aside, from, all, that, (and, the, lesser-known, goof, listing, The, Piano, producer, Jan, Chapman, among, the, dead, in, the, In, Memoriam, segment, instead, of, costume, designer, Janet, Patterson),, it, was, a, competent, enough, evening., Jimmy, Kimmel, had, some, decent, barbs, in, his, pocket,, and, as, usual, he, got, considerable, mileage, out, of, his, faux, feud, with, Matt, Damon., (I, can, imagine, baffled, Oscar-night, viewers, unfamiliar, with, the, Kimmel-Damon, beef, that’s, been, going, on, for, over, a, decade, on, Kimmel’s, late-night, show., “Why, is, he, being, so, mean, to, Matt, Damon?”, they, might, have, said.), Kimmel’s, Mean, Tweets, were, amusing, as, always,, the, bit, with, the, bus, tour, maybe, not, so, much., The, thing, about, Moonlight’s, win, —, sorry,, but, this, was, the, night’s, big, story, —, is, that, it, garnered, a, Screenplay, (adapted), award,, while, La, La, Land,, over, in, Original, Screenplay,, lost, to, Manchester, by, the, Sea., Hindsight, is, always, 20/20,, but, La, La, Land, not, winning, a, writing, trophy, may, not, have, been, a, positive, sign, for, its, Best, Picture, win., A, Best, Picture, not, winning, a, Screenplay, award, is, not, unprecedented, —, it, isn’t, even, that, rare, (The, Artist, was, the, last, film, to, do, so), —, but, it, doesn’t, exactly, help., In, the, end,, Moonlight, director, Barry, Jenkins, had, to, be, content, with, his, shared, Screenplay, Oscar, and, the, knowledge, that, he’d, helmed, the, big, winner,, while, La, La, Land, director, Damien, Chazelle, settled, for, Best, Director, and, the, five, other, Oscars, it, won., One, last, thing., Many, fans, of, Bill, Paxton,, who, died, right, before, the, Oscar, ceremony,, grumbled, that, he, wasn’t, included, in, the, In, Memoriam, piece., The, reason, is, simple:, the, montage, is, created, weeks, in, advance,, and, generally, covers, the, period, from, February, 1, of, the, previous, year, to, January, 31, of, the, current, year., This, is, also, why, Alan, Rickman, and, David, Bowie, weren’t, acknowledged, this, year, —, because, they, were, included, last, year., Paxton, will,, one, hopes,, be, remembered, during, Oscar, Night, 2018., Know, what, else, will, be, remembered, next, year?, That, card, being, held, up,, declaring, La, La, Land’s, brief, reign, as, Best, Picture, winner, as, dead, as, Paxton., Comments:, Be, the, first, to, comment, «, Older,
