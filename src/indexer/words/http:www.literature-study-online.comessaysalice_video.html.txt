[And, Alice, Played, a, Video, Game., Alice,, Harry, Potter, and, the, Computer, Game:, a, study, of, the, relationship, between, children's, fantasy, adventure, stories, and, interactive, computer, games, by, Souvik, Mukherjee, English, Literature, Literature, Links, English, Literature, Essays, English, Literature, Bookshop, Short, Story, Writing, Books, on, Film, Alice's, Adventures, in, Wonderland,, by, Lewis, Carroll, American, McGee's, Alice., Electronic, Arts, Harry, Potter, and, the, Sorcerer's, Stone, J, K, Rowling, Harry, Potter, and, the, Sorcerer's, Stone., Electronic, Arts, How, often, one, wishes, to, learn, some, magic, and, to, be, Peter, Pan, or, Harry, Potter, or, visit, Wonderland, with, Alice!, But,, then, again, I, often, wonder,, would, their, stories, remain, the, same, if, I, stepped, into, their, roles?, Would, I, have, acted, differently?, And,, would, that, have, changed, the, narrative, altogether?, Then,, what, if, every, one, of, us, wanted, to, 'be', Harry, Potter,, in, his, or, her, own, separate, way?, Then, what, would, happen, to, the, infinity, of, Harry, Potter, stories,, thus, generated?, The, result, we, might, expect, would, be, chaos., The, actual, result,, however,, would, be, something, else:, it, would, be, a, computer, game!, In, this, paper, I, would, like, to, propose, that, the, multiple, possibilities, of, narrative, action, in, children's, fiction,, especially, fantasies, such, as, Alice's, Adventures, in, Wonderland, or, the, Harry, Potter, stories,, bring, these, stories, very, close, to, computer, games., I, believe, that, certain, sub-genres, of, children's, fiction, work, with, premises, similar, to, the, computer, game, as, regards, narrative, flexibility, and, other, features., A, child's, dream,, as, in, Alice, or, in, Hojoborolo,, can, create, an, unreal, world, full, of, constant, activity, as, in, computer, games., These, can, be, shown, as, prototypes, for, computer, games, or, games, in, the, making., I, shall, therefore, take, two, children, from, fiction, to, compare, the, child, in, literature, with, the, child, in, the, game:, Alice, in, Through, the, Looking, Glass, and, Harry, Potter, in, Harry, Potter, and, the, Sorcerer's, Stone, (also, known, as, Harry, Potter, and, the, Philosopher's, Stone)., The, chief, reason, behind, the, choice, is, that, they, are, both, popular, and, representative, of, their, respective, centuries., The, other, reason, is, purely, technical:, both, characters, have, been, represented, in, eponymous, computer, games., I, am, here, using, the, American, McGee's, Alice, and, Harry, Potter, and, the, Sorcerer's, Stone,, both, made, by, Electronic, Arts,, as, examples, of, such, games., Since, I, haven't, as, yet, played, the, Harry, Potter, game,, I, shall, use, the, Alice, game, for, a, first-hand, account., I, shall, however, use, screenshots, and, game, reviews, to, comment, about, both, of, them., But, first, let, us, see, how, a, computer, game, actually, works., The, computer, game, consists, of, infinitely, branching, levels, of, narrative., The, story, changes, from, player, to, player., In, fact,, the, player, is, both, the, author, of, the, story, as, well, as, reader., Therefore, very, often,, comparisons, have, been, made, with, Jorge, Luis, Borges's, short, story, The, Garden, of, the, Forked, Paths, or, with, hypertext, and, interactive, fiction., The, game, does, not, follow, narrative, time:, every, action, in, it, happens, 'now'., Because, of, the, innumerable, possibilities, involved,, the, game, is, distanced, from, reality., And, it, often, evaluates, the, player's, skill., Let, us, then, build, up, a, workable, definition, from, these, clauses:, The, computer, game,, then,, is, an, activity, taking, place, on, the, basis, of, formally, defined, rules,, containing, an, evaluation, of, the, efforts, of, the, player, and, the, story, of, which, differs, from, player, to, player., When, playing, a, game,, the, rest, of, the, world, is, ignored., The, American, dramaturgist, and, computer, theorist, Brenda, Laurel, has, extended, the, idea, of, stories, to, interact, with, and, take, part, in, in, a, more, theoretical, way., [1], In, this, proposed, system,, the, computer, program, must, take, on, the, role, as, author, while, the, game, progresses., Any, action, by, the, player, must, lead, to, the, system, adapting, the, fictive, world., According, to, the, game, designer, Chris, Crawford,, computer, games, have, four, basic, characteristics, (Crawford, 1982), [2]:, 1., Representation:, A, game, is, a, closed, formal, system, that, subjectively, represents, a, subset, of, reality., (By, subjective,, Crawford, means, that, a, game, is, not, necessarily, trying, to, represent, reality.), 2., Interaction:, The, game, acknowledges, and, reacts, to, the, player., (Unlike, a, puzzle,, which, simply, lies, still.), 3., Conflict:, A, game, presupposes, a, conflict., This, can, be, either, between, several, players, or, between, the, players', goal, and, whatever, prevents, the, player, from, reaching, that, goal., 4., Safety., The, player, is, safe, (in, a, literal, sense), from, the, events, in, the, game., (Gambling, presents, a, special, case,, where, the, outcome, of, the, game, is, designed, to, have, impact, in, the, real, world.), To, this, fourfold, definition,, I, will, add, a, fifth, clause:, 5., The, construction, of, narrative:, as, stated, before,, every, game, keeps, constructing, its, own, narrative., We, will, first, look, at, the, inherent, game-like, structure, in, both, the, stories, of, Alice, and, Harry, Potter., Then, we, shall, consider, each, of, the, five, defining, clauses, of, the, formal, computer, game, and, see, how, applicable, they, are, to, the, stories, of, Alice, and, Harry,, and, thereby, to, some, types, of, children's, fiction., Before, that,, however,, we, could, possibly, look, at, a, few, other, types, of, literature, and, see, how, closely, they, resemble, the, computer, game., I, have, concentrated, on, children's, fiction, set, in, fantasy, environments, and, not, on, 'serious', children's, fiction., Children, like, Oliver, Twist, or, Little, Nell, are, essential, part, of, an, emotional, and, realistic, environment., Hence, they, have, no, place, in, the, computer, game., The, real, world, excludes, a, large, number, of, choices,, which, can, be, made, in, the, fantasy, world., As, Humpty, Dumpty, says, to, Alice,, 'When, I, use, a, word,, it, means, just, what, I, choose, it, to, mean'., You, couldn't, do, that, in, the, real, world,, could, you?, As, for, emotions,, I, do, not, think, any, extant, computer, game, can, accommodate, what, E., M., Forster, calls, a, 'round', character., Instead, there, is,, a, rather, flat, character, whose, involvement, in, the, plot, is, not, emotional,, but, rather, a, matter, of, exploring, a, world,, solving, problems,, performing, actions,, competing, against, enemies,, and, above, all, dealing, with, objects, in, a, concrete, environment., This, kind, of, involvement, is, much, closer, to, playing, a, computer, game, than, to, living, a, Victorian, novel, or, a, Shakespearean, drama., Certain, other, types, of, narration, have, often, been, cited, as, being, very, close, to, the, game-structure,, namely, science, fiction, and, the, cinema., My, argument, would, be, that, these, do, not, show, an, equal, degree, of, interactivity, to, the, game,, or, for, that, matter, the, children's, fantasy., I, shall, elaborate, on, this, later, on,, when, I, look, at, interactivity, separately., Most, children's, fiction,, however,, shows, a, game-structure, to, some, extent., Let, us, see, how., Both, Alice, and, Harry, are, playing, games, in, their, respective, stories., Through, the, Looking, Glass, can, be, looked, at, as, a, chess, game, in, progress., Lewis, Carroll, himself, comments, on, the, playability, of, his, story:, 'As, the, chess-problem,, given, on, the, next, page,, has, puzzled, some, of, my, readers,, it, may, be, well, to, explain, that, it, is, correctly, worked,, so, far, as, the, moves, are, concerned.', [my, italics], This, comment, makes, the, game, associations, of, his, book, even, more, obvious., In, fact,, both, Alice, books, are, based, on, games., Alice's, Adventures, in, Wonderland, could, be, seen, as, a, kind, of, card, game,, and, we, have, already, spoken, of, Through, the, Looking, Glass., Besides, the, cards, and, the, chess, games,, they, also, contain, plenty, of, mathematical, puzzles, and, word, games., Being, awfully, bad, at, maths,, I, would, not, dare, bother, you, with, mathematical, problems., Speaking, instead, of, word-games,, Humpty, Dumpty's, analysis, of, the, Jabberwocky, poem, is, a, famous, example:, "To, 'gyre', is, to, go, round, and, round, like, a, gyroscope., To, 'gimble', is, to, make, holes, like, a, gimlet.", "And, "the, wabe', is, the, grass, plot, round, a, sundial,, I, suppose?", said, Alice,, surprised, at, her, own, ingenuity., "Of, course, it, is., It's, called, 'wabe',, you, know, because, it, goes, a, long, way, before, it,, and, a, long, way, behind, it, ., ., ., ", "And, a, long, way, beyond, it, on, each, side,", Alice, added., "Exactly, so., Well,, the, 'mimsy', is, 'flimsy, and, miserable', (there's, another, portmanteau, for, you).", Both, Humpty, and, Alice, are, playing, with, English, words, and, juggling, with, them, to, create, new, ones., The, reading, of, the, Jabberwocky, poem, is, also, a, game., Alice, uses, a, mirror, to, read, it, and, finds, a, poem,, which, resembles, English., But, there, could, be, plenty, of, other, ways, to, look, at, it., There, could, also, be, an, utter, failure, to, make, anything, out, of, it., Other, than, these, the, books, are, replete, with, all, sorts, of, games:, there, is, croquet,, a, caucus-race, and, a, mock-chivalric, joust., Like, the, many, games, in, the, Alice, books,, Quidditch, in, Harry, Potter, seems, to, contain, many, games, in, one,, perhaps, a, combination, of, hang-gliding,, hockey,, and, bungee, jumping., And, Harry, loves, quidditch;, there, are, over, three, games, of, quidditch, played, in, the, first, book, alone., As, in, Through, the, Looking, Glass, here, too, there, are, games, of, chess,, called, wizard, chess,, being, played., Harry's, best, friend,, Ron, Weasley, is, a, past, master, of, this, game., In, the, Harry, Potter, stories,, games, actually, play, a, major, part, in, problem-solving., In, the, first, book,, two, of, the, spells, guarding, the, philosopher's, stone, involve, game, playing., Harry, has, to, play, one, of, his, best, games, of, quidditch, to, gain, the, key, to, the, door., The, door, itself, opens, to, reveal, another, game:, this, time,, a, huge, set, of, wizard, chess, where, the, huge, pieces, actually, destroy, themselves., To, cross, the, floor, they, have, to, checkmate, the, white, king, and, conquer, the, white, army,, which, guards, the, passage., ''It's, obvious,, isn't, it?", says, Ron., "We've, got, to, play, our, way, across, the, room.", Like, all, games,, the, games, played, in, these, books, have, their, objectives., It, might, be, to, cross, a, passage, as, in, the, last, example,, or, to, go, to, a, new, place, as, in, Through, the, Looking, Glass,, or, simply, to, win, house, points, for, Gryffindor, as, in, Harry's, quidditch, matches., Similarly,, the, story, as, a, whole, has, its, objective:, to, destroy, Voldemort's, evil, plans, in, Harry, Potter, and, for, Alice,, to, become, a, queen, or, simply, to, go, home., Now, it, would, be, instructive, to, compare, this, with, the, computer, game, per, se., This, too, has, its, objective:, victory, or, the, maximum, points, scored., If, the, game, evaluates, the, player,, Harry, Potter, in, the, story, is, also, being, constantly, evaluated, and, keeps, gaining, or, losing, house-points., The, formal, set, of, rules, that, form, the, base, of, the, computer, game, can, be, compared, to, the, basic, conventions, of, the, fictional, narrative., We, said, earlier, that, while, playing, a, game, the, rest, of, the, world, is, ignored., This, is, evident, both, in, Alice, and, in, Harry, Potter., The, definition, we, prepared, for, the, computer, game, is, therefore, equally, true, of, these, books., What, remains, now, is, to, consider, the, five, clauses, which, were, used, to, evaluate, the, effectiveness, of, the, computer, game,, namely:, representation,, interactivity,, narrative, construction,, conflict, and, safety., About, the, representation, of, a, subset, of, reality,, I, do, not, have, much, to, say., The, Harry, Potter, story, has, a, quasi-real, environment,, which, is, a, 'not-so-well-known, part, of, England'., But, it, is, there, and, even, has, its, own, ministry, -, the, ministry, of, magic., The, same, goes, for, Alice., Interactivity, of, games, and, narratives, has, long, been, a, controversial, topic., Questions, of, how, interactive, a, game, or, a, book, can, be, are, matters, of, dispute., But, that, the, computer, game,, at, least,, is, to, some, extent, interactive, has, been, accepted., Once, I, start, a, game,, I, can, control, the, fate, of, my, narrative., I, keep, interacting, with, a, set, of, rules, and, thereby, make, my, own, changes, and, augmentations, to, a, narrative, existing, only, in, its, shell,, as, in, the, base, narrative, told, at, the, beginning, of, games, like, American, McGee's, Alice, and, Harry, Potter, and, the, Sorcerer's, Stone., This, interactivity, is, not, present, in, normal, forms, of, fiction, where, there, is, no, possibility, of, intruding, into, the, plot., Nor, would, it, be, possible, in, the, movie, or, in, science, fiction, as, much, as, in, children's, fiction, like, Harry, Potter, that, involves, fantasy, and, a, game-structure, as, shown, earlier., For, example, Harry, Potter, has, to, work, out, a, riddle, for, reaching, the, philosopher's, stone., He, has, to, discover, a, hidden, set, of, rules, by, which, he, changes, his, story, in, his, favour., In, other, forms, of, narrative,, barring, some, forms, of, science, fiction, [3],, the, possibilities, of, change, are, far, the, lesser., Not, so, in, the, Harry, Potter, stories., Hogwarts, literally, keeps, changing, itself., The, staircases, keep, moving, and, changing, places., Doors, pretend, to, be, walls., Paintings, move, from, canvas, to, canvas., On, top, of, everything,, there, is, Peeves, the, poltergeist, to, confuse, you., Similarly,, in, Wonderland, Alice, finds, no, help, in, the, Cheshire, cat, when, she, asks, for, directions:, "In, that, direction,", the, Cat, said,, waving, its, right, paw, round,, "lives, a, Hatter:, and, in, that, direction,", waving, the, other, paw,, "lives, a, March, Hare., Visit, either, you, like:, they're, both, mad.", But, there, are, always, plenty, of, possibilities, present:, if, the, staircase, had, not, confused, him,, Harry, would, never, have, discovered, the, secret, door, guarded, by, the, three-headed, dog., The, story, could, then, have, been, entirely, different., Had, Alice, not, played, the, chess-game, the, way, she, did, the, story, could, have, taken, a, different, turn., She, could, either, have, won, the, game, in, more, than, the, eleven, moves,, which, make, up, her, story, or, she, could, have, lost, all, her, pieces., It, is, just, that, both, Harry, Potter, and, Alice, have, used, the, numerous, choices, available, to, construct, their, stories, as, we, read, them, now., The, errant, staircase, could, have, behaved, itself, in, the, Philosopher's, Stone, and, Alice, could, have, proved, a, less, competent, chess-player., For, that, matter,, so, could, Ron, Weasley., God, knows, what, would, have, happened, then., I, can,, however,, give, you, one, alternative., For, this, I, must, tell, you, a, story:, The, White, Rabbit, popped, up, every, now, and, then, and, told, me,, 'Don't, dawdle, Alice., We, must, be, on, our, way'., And, guess, who, was, my, guide!, it, was, the, Cheshire, cat., And, as, can, be, expected,, it, ditched, me, whenever, I, needed, advice, and, vanished, into, thin, air., Suddenly, two, chessmen, attacked, me:, the, knight, charged, and, the, castle, blocked, my, way., Luckily,, I, found, the, vorpal, sword, in, time, and, killed, them, both., Now, was, the, time, to, set, out, and, kill, the, Jabberwocky., But, I, believe,, I, had, been, a, trifle, careless, and, a, red, pawn, cut, my, head, off, with, an, axe., And, before, I, had, fully, realized, what, had, happened, I, heard,, as, I, had, heard, so, many, times,, the, Hatter's, insane, laugh, and, once, again, the, game, was, over., This,, though, I, am, a, rather, bad, storyteller,, is, not, entirely, my, own, concoction., Yet, in, a, way,, it, is., This, was, just, one, outcome, of, my, playing, the, game, called, the, American, McGee's, Alice,, which, I, have, already, introduced., The, basic, plot, might, belong, to, the, game, but, the, choices, which, take, it, further, are, mine., And, even, if, I, might, not, have, realized, it,, I, was, constructing, an, entirely, new, narrative, while, playing., Let, us, now, discuss, the, other, chief, clause, that, we, have, spoken, of:, the, construction, of, the, narrative., In, the, process, let, me, introduce, the, basic, story, of, the, two, computer, games,, for, those, of, us, who, are, not, already, familiar, with, them., For, this, purpose, I, shall, use, game, reviews, published, in, popular, gaming, magazines, or, web, sites., TechTV,, a, computer, game-oriented, web, site, comments:, The, key, to, this, game's, success, is, its, simplicity., You, navigate, through, Harry, Potter, with, the, arrow, keys, or,, occasionally,, the, mouse., Gameplay, is, in, the, third, person, and, your, view, is, fixed, over, Harry's, shoulder,, his, Hogwarts, cloak, flapping, in, the, wind, behind, him., The, game, begins, with, a, quick, voice-over, synopsis, of, the, story's, opening, events., Gameplay, kicks, in, after, the, Sorting, Hat, places, Harry, (at, his, request), in, Gryffindor., Next, we, meet, Albus, Dumbledore,, who, invites, Harry, to, explore, the, castle, but, reminds, him, not, to, be, late, for, class., The, game, then, takes, on, a, tutorial, tone, as, Harry, explores, Hogwarts, and, its, environs, and, learns, how, to, cast, spells, and, navigate, the, puzzles, he'll, face, later., In, other, words,, this, game, is, about, jumping, puzzles,, timing, puzzles,, and, exploration, -, all, very, simple, and, not, at, all, challenging., There, is, no, death, here,, only, the, prospect, of, Harry, fainting, and, having, to, restart., Instead, of, posing, a, challenge,, Harry, Potter, offers, variety, and, charm., It, never, lets, you, stay, in, one, place, for, long., One, minute, you're, engaged, in, jumping, puzzles,, the, next, you're, levitating, giant, statuary, onto, platforms,, and, then, you're, riding, a, broom, ., ., ., I've, already, spoken, about, the, Alice, game,, but, the, Electronic, Arts, Review, would, perhaps, be, of, some, more, help:, When, Alice, answers, a, distressed, summons, to, return, to, Wonderland,, she, barely, recognizes, the, befouled, setting., From, the, fungal, rot, of, the, Mushroom, Forest, to, the, infernal, chemistry, of, the, Mad, Hatter's, Domain, and, beyond,, Wonderland, festers, to, its, core., Undaunted, by, the, diseased, ambience,, cavernous, confusion,, and, mortal, danger, that, surround, her,, Alice, must, undo, the, chaos., Equipped, with, courage,, a, keen, appetite, for, the, bizarre,, and, a, lethal, array, of, transmogrified, toys,, she'll, penetrate, the, strongholds, of, her, enemies,, confront, the, forces, of, evil,, and, put, the, wicked, Queen, of, Hearts, in, her, place., In, this, game,, of, course,, one, finds, the, basic, plot, of, the, Alice, stories, given, a, different, twist., As, far, as, I, have, been, able, to, play, it,, all, the, characters, from, the, book, are, there,, but, the, hints, of, evilness, in, the, Queen, of, Hearts, and, the, madness, of, the, Hatter, and, the, March, Hare, have, been, given, a, diabolic, twist., For, regular, gamers, this, game, is, scarcely, different, from, the, 3-d, shooting, games, (first-person-shooters), like, Doom, or, Quake., Both, games, involve, constant, action., The, action, is, dependent, on, the, player's, choice., If, the, player's, interpretation, of, the, situation, differs, then, he, makes, different, choices., These, choices, determine, what, puzzle, he, must, solve, and, in, what, time, sequence., Together, with, that, there, is, the, constant, risk, of, failure., As, in, my, case,, where, the, white, pawn, attacks, me, from, behind., There, is, also, the, chance, of, getting, lost, in, the, game, world, if, one, strays, onto, the, wrong, path., This, is, again, reminiscent, of, Borges's, The, Garden, of, Forked, Paths., Borges, makes, his, character,, the, famous, sinologist, Stephen, Albert, say,, 'time, forks, perpetually, towards, innumerable, futures'., The, narrative, in, the, game, too,, forks, towards, innumerable, futures., In, this, sense, the, game, has, also, been, compared, to, the, hypertext., The, hypertext, theorist, David, Bolter, claims, that, when, Wolfgang, Iser, and, Stanley, Fish, argue, that, the, reader, constitutes, the, text, in, the, act, of, reading,, they, are, describing, hypertext., If, that, is, so,, then, the, reader-response, theory, can, also, be, applied, to, the, computer, game., Of, course,, the, reader-response, theory, itself, has, several, positions, within, it,, so, this, might, prove, difficult., We, could, possibly, apply, Fish's, theory,, that, the, reader, creates, the, entire, text,, to, the, computer, game., Instead, of, 'creates', perhaps, one, should, say, 'recreates', because, the, game, is, not, completely, free, of, the, base, narrative., This, would, then, bring, us, to, a, question, of, control, over, the, narrative., Game, design, theory, talks, of, controlled, access, vis-à-vis, random, access., Controlled, access, refers, to, the, series, of, choices, which, govern, the, game,, and, random, access, to, the, element, of, uncertainty, plus, the, base, plot, of, the, game., it, is, only, with, a, balance, of, the, two, that, a, narrative, can, be, properly, constructed., I, would, argue, that, even, in, the, books,, Alice, and, Harry, try, to, maintain, this, balance, as, they, play, along, their, respective, game, patterns, and, construct, their, stories., Let, us, take, an, example, from, Harry, Potter, and, the, Sorcerer's, Stone., Harry, has, suddenly, been, moved, from, the, human, world, to, the, wizarding, world, by, the, giant, Hagrid., This, is, an, instance, of, random, access., Whoever, knew, that, the, boy, from, Privet, Drive, had, magical, powers!, That, he, has, to, go, to, Hogwarts, and, join, the, sorting, ceremony, is, compulsory., Such, events, in, the, book, correspond, to, the, basic, rules, of, the, game., But, when, he, puts, on, the, sorting, hat, a, different, thing, happens., He, makes, a, desperate, mental, effort, to, exercise, his, choice, not, to, join, the, Slytherins., This, is, controlled, access., Harry, Potter, has, made, a, controlled, choice., Therefore, even, in, narrative, construction,, the, book, has, some, similarities, with, the, games., The, next, things, to, consider, would, be, the, penultimate, and, ultimate, clauses, of, our, comparison:, conflict, and, safety., Without, conflict, there, cannot, be, any, fun, in, achieving, your, objective., And, fun, is, essential, to, any, game., It, is, the, reason, why, we, play., This, is, one, area, where, both, the, Harry, Potter, books, and, the, game, are, the, most, similar., In, both, of, these, there, is, the, major, conflict, with, Voldemort, and, certain, minor, conflicts, between, Draco, Malfoy, and, Harry,, or, with, the, ever-wrathful, Snape., In, the, American, McGee's, Alice, game,, the, conflict, is, simple:, almost, every, creature, in, the, diabolic, Wonderland, is, an, enemy., The, conflict, in, the, Alice, books,, however,, is, more, difficult, to, define., Robert, Polhemus, in, his, essay, Play,, Nonsense,, Games:, Comic, Diversion, has, this, to, say, about, the, nonsense, in, Carroll:, But, there, is, an, equally, strong, hostile, impulse, in, nonsense, -, the, desire, to, satirize, the, senselessness, of, the, world., The, Red, Queen, sums, it, up:, 'you, may, call, it, 'nonsense', if, you, like, ., ., ., but, I've, heard, nonsense,, compared, with, which, that, would, be, as, sensible, as, a, dictionary!', As, usual, in, Carroll,, what, at, first, seems, self-enclosed, is, in, another, light,, mimetic, and, referential., The, nonsense, poem, A-sitting, on, a, gate, says, in, effect, that, there, are, things, in, Wordsworth's, Resolution, and, Independence, just, as, absurd, as, anything, the, white, knight, can, devise.", The, conflict, in, the, Alice, books, is, against, society, and, a, backdrop, of, nonsense, veils, it., [4], Safety, in, a, computer, game, implies, both, the, players, literal, safety, from, the, violence, in, the, game, and, the, apparent, distance, from, the, rest, of, the, world, while, playing., In, the, literal, sense,, we, must, admit,, neither, Alice, nor, Harry, are, safe, from, the, action, in, their, stories., In, fact,, Harry, comes, out, of, it, badly, injured, after, his, encounter, with, Voldemort., But, as, far, as, the, distance, from, the, outside, world, is, concerned,, we, must, remember, that, when, Harry, fights, Quirrell,, he, is, completely, alone., As, for, Alice,, she, is, in, a, strange, world, of, dreams, and, the, outside, world, is, far, away, as, long, as, she, is, asleep., We, have, seen, the, intrinsic, similarities, of, these, two, books, with, their, counterparts, in, computer, games, and, with, the, structure, of, computer, games,, in, general., Analysed, in, terms, of, the, defining, clauses, of, such, games,, these, books, reveal, many, similarities., Many, of, the, clauses, have, been, as, easily, applied, to, these, books, as, to, games., Like, the, player, of, the, computer, games,, both, Harry, and, Alice, create, and, simultaneously, read, their, own, stories., The, story, as, we, currently, have, it, in, Harry, Potter, and, the, Sorcerer's, Stone, and, in, Through, the, Looking, Glass, can, then, be, seen, as, one, played, game, among, the, infinite, playable, games, possible., Among, the, latter,, even, my, own, abortive, Alice, game, finds, its, place., Here, I, would, like, to, point, out, that, some, children's, books, capitalized, on, their, game-like, narrative, flexibility, long, before, video, games, were, conceived, of., At, a, recent, seminar, on, the, History, of, the, Book,, Dr., Alexis, Tadie, drew, attention, to, a, parallel, story, narrated, in, the, marginalia, of, a, British, soldier's, copy, of, Kim, [5]., The, fact, that, the, story, of, Kim, can, be, read, also, as, a, Tommy's, life-story, is, intriguing,, indeed., In, effect,, then,, perhaps, the, soldier, who, possessed, that, copy, of, Kim, was, playing, 'the, Great, Game', mentioned, in, the, novel,, in, his, own, way., Thus, we, can, see, how, certain, types, of, children's, fiction, can, be, looked, at, as, proto-computer, games., And, though, unlike, computer, games, in, that, they, tell, just, one, story, at, a, time,, they, are, similar, because, they, contain, numerous, other, potential, narratives., I, would, like, to, conclude, by, saying, that, the, child, in, the, book, looks, forward, to, the, child, in, the, game, and, thereby, to, an, ideal, inexhaustible, narrative., Bibliography:, Texts:, Lewis, Carroll., Through, the, Looking, Glass., [available, online], J, K, Rowling., Harry,
