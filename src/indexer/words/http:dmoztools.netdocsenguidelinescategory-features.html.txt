Usenet, Groups, Mozilla, Images, Alphabet, Bars, Use, alphabet, bars, to, organize, sites, as, a, last, resort., Generally,, editors, should, use, them, sparingly, because, they, are, not, easy, for, end-users, to, navigate., Examples, of, when, alphabet, bars, may, be, useful, include, collections, of, hundreds, of, URLs, or, @links, that, cannot, easily, be, subcategorized,, such, as, artist, names, and, authors., Editors, often, find, it, useful, to, consult, with, fellow, editors, to, determine, if, an, alphabet, bar, is, the, best, choice, for, subcategorization., To, create, an, alphabet, bar,, click, on, the, "Make, an, alphabar", link, on, the, category, edit, page., This, tool, will, guide, you, through, the, process, of, creating, the, alphabet, bar, and, placing, sites, under, the, correct, letter., Sort, Priority, Subcategories, and, @links, may, be, grouped, together, in, up, to, 3, sets., Horizontal, lines, separate, these, groupings., Each, group, is, separated, by, a, horizontal, line., Using, Sort, Priority, Sort, priority, should, group, similar, categories, together, in, a, logical, and, intuitive, way., Sort, priority, can, be, used, as, an, alternative, to, creating, an, additional, layer, of, subcategories., Sort, Priority, is, meant, to, list, the, most, popular, or, frequently, visited, subcategories, near, the, top, of, the, display., It, is, also, used, to, separate, two, different, aspects, of, a, category., Sort, priority, is, usually, not, useful, in, a, category, that, does, not, have, many, subcategories,, because, splitting, them, into, two, or, three, groups, will, not, really, change, the, appearance, of, the, category., Keep, the, end-user, in, mind, when, sorting, categories,, as, this, tool, is, meant, to, help, them, browse, and, navigate, the, directory., Setting, Sort, Priority, If, others, edit, your, category,, make, sure, you've, discussed, your, ideas, for, sort, priority, with, them, before, setting, sort, priority., To, set, the, sort, priority, for, your, category,, click, on, the, "Set, sort, priority, for, subcategories", link, on, the, category, edit, page., Use, the, radio, buttons, next, to, the, category, names, to, specify, how, subcategories, should, be, sorted., @Links, Also, known, as, symlinks,, @links, point, to, categories, that, could, serve, as, subcategories, of, the, current, category., Symlinks, are, distinguished, with, the, @, at, the, end, of, the, category, name., There, can, be, many, @links, in, a, single, category., @links, are, mixed, in, with, the, subcategories., A, new, subcategory, that, might, duplicate, the, entries, of, an, already, existing, category, should, include, an, @link, to, that, category., Having, more, than, one, category, with, the, same, listings, means, more, work, for, editors, and, a, less, useful, directory, for, users., Example:, Arts/Performing_Arts/Magicians@, -, This, @link, leads, the, user, to, Arts:, Performing, Arts:, Magic:, Magicians., Thus,, the, Magicians@, category, in, the, example, is, @linked, to, Magic/Magicians, and, Magic/Magicians, is, @linked, from, Arts:, Performing, Arts., Creating, @links, To, add, an, @link, in, a, category,, go, to, that, category's, Edit, page, and, click, "[Add, @link]", at, the, end, of, the, list, of, subcategories., Use, slashes, to, separate, categories, in, the, path, to, the, category, you, want, to, link, to,, and, replace, any, spaces, in, the, category, name, with, underscores, ("_")., On, the, editing, page,, an, @link, to, a, category, that, you, do, not, have, editing, privileges, for, will, appear, in, black, (since, you, can't, edit, in, that, category)., Editing, Tip:, You, may, copy, the, category, title, from, the, browser, address, bar, like, this,, "Computers/Internet/WWW/Searching_the_Web/Directories",, and, then, paste, that, text, into, the, "Category", blank, in, the, form., Most, systems, will, copy, text, by, using, the, command, "ctrl-c", and, paste, copied, text, by, using, the, command, "ctrl-v"., Deleting, @Links, The, "delete, link", button, next, to, the, @links, on, the, editor, page, is, not, an, instruction, that, the, link, needs, to, be, deleted., If, you, accidentally, click, on, the, "delete, link", button, (or, you, wanted, to, delete, an, @link, but, then, changed, your, mind),, click, on, "Cancel"., Related, Categories, Related, category, links, point, to, categories, on, connected, topics, in, other, areas, of, the, directory., There, should, only, be, a, few, related, categories, in, each, subcategory., Often, a, reciprocal, link, between, two, categories, will, be, set, up, as, an, @link, in, one, direction, and, a, related, category, in, the, other, direction., Creating, Related, Categories, To, create, a, related, category, link, go, to, your, category's, edit, page, and, click, [Add/remove, related, DMOZ, categories], and, enter, the, category, names., When, to, Use, an, @link, vs., a, Related, Link, and, @links, and, Related, Categories, Note:, @link, and, related, category, link, requests, can, be, made, through, editall, and, meta, editors,, should, you, not, have, editing, rights, in, a, category, where, you, think, an, @link, or, related, category, link, would, be, useful., Each, category, has, a, forum, thread, devoted, to, these, types, of, requests., The, thread, is, usually, titled, "Rename/Delete/Move/Sort, Requests"., Do, not, insert, @links, or, related, category, links, that, lead, back, to, your, editor, Bookmarks, or, Test, categories., These, are, personal, workspaces,, and, are, not, meant, for, public, view., Language, Groups, Formerly, known, as, "altlangs",, the, Language, Group, system, cross-links, categories, on, the, same, subject, in, different, languages., To, add, a, category, to, a, Language, Group, use, the, [Add, to, language, group], option;, you, only, need, to, add, one, category, from, the, group,, all, the, other, links, are, then, added, and, updated, automatically., A, category, may, only, belong, to, one, language, group,, so, some, care, is, needed, in, its, selection., Some, categories, only, have, near, equivalents;, please, use, a, Relcat, instead, of, a, Language, Group., Others, have, no, equivalent;, in, this, case, the, Language, Group, should, be, left, blank., The, concept, of, Language, Groups, (editor, forum, thread), is, quite, close, to, that, of, the, previous, Altlang, system,, so, much, of, the, documentation, still, applies:, Alternative, Language, Linking:, Please, Take, Care, and, Alternative, Language, Links, Category, Charters, and, Guidelines, On, the, category, edit, page,, the, link, named, "Edit, Category,

editors, in, your, category, should, agree, to, them, before, they, are, posted, in, this, section., DMOZ, Guidelines, apply, to, every, branch, and, category, of, the, directory., Editors, in, some, top, level, branches, of, the, directory, have, created, their, own, set, of, guidelines, that, are, meant, to, complement, these, general, directory-wide, guidelines., Category, guidelines, provide, instructions, for, handing, unique, taxonomy, and, ontology, issues, relevant, to, the, category's, subject, area., Please, note, that, category, specific, guidelines, should, never, contradict, anything, in, these, guidelines,, and, nothing, in, the, category, guidelines, supersedes, the, DMOZ, Guidelines., A, repository, of, links, to, category, specific, guidelines, and, FAQs, are, maintained, at, Computers:, Internet:, Searching:, Directories:, DMOZ:, Policies, and, Procedures:, Editing, Guidelines., Category, FAQs, A, category, FAQ, is, a, way, to, provide, information, to,
