[Medieval, Unicode, Font, Initiative, Disclaimer:, This, site, is, managed, by, scholars, in, Medieval, studies, with, the, aim, of, establishing, a, consensus, on, the, use, of, Unicode, among, medievalists., It, is, not, affiliated, with, or, endorsed, by, Unicode., Background, The, Medieval, Unicode, Font, Initiative, is, a, non-profit, workgroup, of, scholars, and, font, designers, who, would, like, to, see, a, common, solution, to, a, problem, felt, by, many, medieval, scholars:, the, encoding, and, display, of, special, characters, in, Medieval, texts, written, in, the, Latin, alphabet., MUFI, was, founded, in, July, 2001, by, a, workgroup, consisting, of, Odd, Einar, Haugen, (Bergen),, Alec, McAllister, (Leeds), and, Tarrin, Wills, (Sydney/Aberdeen)., The, members, of, the, workgroup, communicates, primarily, by, e-mail,, but, have, occasionally, met, in, Leeds, (July, 2002, and, 2003)., The, first, MUFI, group, meeting, was, held, in, Bergen, (30-31, August, 2003),, the, second, in, Lisboa,, (10-12, March, 2005),, the, third, in, Bonn, (12-13, June, 2006),, the, fourth, in, Mainz, (23, June, 2008),, the, fifth, in, Bergen, (7-8, April, 2011),, and, the, sixth,, also, in, Bergen, (8-9, September, 2015)., As, of, August, 2006,, MUFI, has, a, board, of, four, members, (listed, in, the, right, column, of, this, page).,  , Why, Unicode?, Unicode, is, the, new, international, font, standard., In, version, 8.0, (published, 17, June, 2015),, it, covers, more, than, 100,000, characters, in, living, as, well, as, historical, scripts., It, is, fully, supported, by, computer, platforms, like, Linux,, Mac, and, Windows., There, is, simply, no, alternative, to, Unicode., Many, characters, needed, by, medieval, scholars, are, already, defined, in, Unicode,, but, a, great, number, of, other, characters,, and, especially, abbreviation, marks,, are, missing., The, Private, Use, Area, in, Unicode, may, be, used, for, encoding, missing, characters,, but, we, would, like, to, see, as, many, special, characters, defined, in, the, official, area, as, possible., For, this, reason,, the, MUFI, groups, is, pursuing, two, lines,, (a), coordinating, the, allocation, of, medieval, characters, in, the, Private, Use, Area, and, (b), proposing, missing, medieval, characters, to, Unicode.,  , MUFI, character, recommendation, Although, the, ultimate, goal, of, the, MUFI, group, is, to, add, a, representative, and, well, defined, inventory, of, medieval, characters, to, the, Unicode, Standard, it, will, be, necessary, to, assign, characters, to, the, Private, Use, Area, for, some, time., In, order, to, establish, a, coordinated, usage, of, this, area,, the, MUFI, group, has, published, a, recommendation, for, the, selection, of, characters, from, the, Unicode, Standard, and, for, characters, to, be, assigned, to, the, Private, Use, Area., This, recommendation, coordinates, the, usage, of, the, PUA, with, several, other, fonts, and, font, projects,, notably, the, TITUS, project, and, Junicode., The, first, version, of, this, recommendation, was, published, in, 2003,, the, second, in, 2006,, the, third, in, 2009,, and, the, fourth, in, 2015., The, fourth, version, contains, 1512, characters, (of, which, 782, have, been, selected, from, various, charts, in, the, official, part, of, the, Standard,, and, 730, are, located, in, the, Private, Use, Area)., It, is, compliant, with, v., 8.0, of, the, Unicode, Standard, and, has, a, persistent, URI, at, the, University, Library, in, Bergen:, http://hdl.handle.net/1956/10699,

v., 3.0, and, v., 4.0, of, the, recommendation,, pipelines, with, new, characters, have, been, published:, Proposals, for, new, MUFI, characters,  , MUFI, font, page, Several, MUFI, compliant, fonts, are, presently, being, developed., All, fonts, contain, a, wide, selection, of, special, characters, and, make, extensive, use, of, the, Private, Use, Area, in, the, Unicode, Standard., Fonts, will, be, available, either, as, shareware, (for, a, modest, fee), or, as, freeware., MUFI, font, page, This, page, contains, a, list, of, all, MUFI, compliant, fonts, with, details, on, design,, format,, availability, etc.,  , Medievist, proposals, to, Unicode, Members, of, the, MUFI, group, and, other, scholars, have, submitted, several, proposals, to, Unicode, for, the, inclusion, of, new, characters, in, the, Standard:, Unicode, proposals,  , LINCUA, How, should, code, points, be, allocated, to, the, Private, Use, Area?, MUFI, is, a, recommendation, for, medievalists,, but, there, are, a, number, of, other, scripts,, some, of, them, neighbouring., In, a, recent, paper,, Andreas, Stötzner,, suggests, a, way, forward:, Towards, a, linguistic, corporate, area?, The, plan, is,
