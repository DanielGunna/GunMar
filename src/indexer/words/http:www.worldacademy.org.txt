The, World, Academy, of, Art, and, Science, is, composed, of, 730, individual, Fellows, from, diverse, cultures,, nationalities,, and, intellectual, disciplines,, chosen, for, eminence, in, art,, the, natural, and, social, sciences,, and, the, humanities., Established, in, 1960, by, distinguished, individuals, concerned, by, the, impact, of, the, explosive, growth, of, knowledge,, its, activities, seek, to, address, global, issues, related, to, the, social, consequences, and, policy, implications, of, knowledge., The, Academy, serves, as, a, forum, for, reflective, scientists,, artists,, and, scholars, to, discuss, the, vital, problems, of, humankind, independent, of, political, boundaries, or, limits,, whether, spiritual, or, physical, --, a, forum, where, these, problems, can, be, discussed, objectively,, scientifically,, globally,, and, free, from, vested, interests, or, regional, attachments,, to, arrive, at, solutions, that, affirm, universal, human, rights, and, serve, the, interests, of, all, humanity., WAAS, is, founded, on, faith, in, the, power, of, original, and, creative, ideas, --, Real, Ideas, with, effective, power, --, to, change, the, world., Its, motto, is, "Leadership, in, thought, that, leads, to, action.", The, spirit, of, the, Academy, can, be, expressed, in, the, words, of, Albert, Einstein:, "The, creations, of, our, mind, shall, be, a, blessing, and, not, a, curse, to, mankind.", Its, Fellows, share, the, ambition, (as, the, Founders, said, in, their, 1960, Manifesto), "to, rediscover, the, language, of, mutual, understanding,", surmounting, differences, in, tradition,, language,, and, social, structure, which,, unless, fused, by, creative, imagination, and, continuous, effort,, dissolve, the, latent, human, commonwealth, in, contention, and, conflict., Scientific, discovery, and, technological, innovation, keep, developing, instruments, of, unparalleled, power, for, fulfillment, or, destruction., We, humans,, more, and, more,, are, taking, into, our, own, hands, the, future, evolution, of, our, bodies,, our, minds,, the, civilizations, we, create,, and, the, very, planet, we, inhabit., So, it, is, imperative, that, we, guide, what, we, do, by, what, we, know,, and, guide, what, we, know, by, what, we, value., The, aim, of, the, Academy's, founders, was, to, function, as, "an, informal, WORLD, UNIVERSITY, at, the, highest, scientific, and, ethical, level,, in, which, deep, human, understanding, and, the, fullest, sense, of, responsibility, will, meet.", The, World, Academy, is, incorporated, in, the, State, of, California, and, is, recognized, by, the, US, Internal, Revenue, Service, as, a, tax, exempt, private, foundation, under, section, 501(c)(3)., MISSION, The, World, Academy, of, Art, and, Science, is, an, association, of, committed, individuals, drawn, from, diverse, cultures,, nationalities,, occupations, and, intellectual, pursuits, spanning, the, arts,, humanities, and, sciences,, conscious, of, the, profound, social, consequences, and, policy, implications, of, knowledge,, and, united, by, a, common, aspiration, to, address, the, urgent, challenges, and, emerging, opportunities, confronting, humanity, today., Our, mission, is, to, promote, cross-disciplinary, dialogue, generative, of, original, ideas, and, integrated, perspectives, that, comprehend, the, root, causes, and, effective, remedies, for, our, common, problems,, while, furthering, those, currents, of, thought, and, social, movement, that, affirm, the, value, of, human, dignity, and, equitable, development., The, Academy, dedicates, itself, to, the, pursuit, of, creative,, catalytic, ideas, that, can, provide, to, present, and, future, generations, enlightened, leadership, in, thought, that, leads, to, effective, action., HISTORY, The, idea, of, founding, an, international, association, for, exploring, major, concerns, of, humanity, in, a, nongovernmental, context, grew, out, of, many, conversations, that, took, place, among, leading, scientists, and, intellectuals, in, the, years, following, World, War, II., Prominent, among, this, group, were, people, such, as, Albert, Einstein, and, Robert, Oppenheimer, who, had, played, a, part, in, the, development, of, the, atomic, bomb, and, were, deeply, concerned, about, how, it, and, other, scientific, advances, might, be, used, –, or, misused., This, informal, project, took, a, major, step, forward, in, 1956,, when, a, meeting, –, The, First, International, Conference, on, Science, and, Human, Welfare, –, was, held, in, Washington,, D., C., The, organizers, were, two, American, scientists:, Richard, Montgomery, Field, of, Princeton,, who, had, worked, for, many, years, as, chairman, of, an, international, committee, on, the, social, values, of, science;, and, John, A., Fleming,, former, President, of, the, International, Council, of, Scientific, Unions., At, the, end, of, the, conference,, participants, agreed, to, take, steps, toward, the, formation, of, a, World, Academy,, and, elected, an, International, Preparatory, Committee, for, that, purpose., Its, members, were:, (from, France), Pierre, Chouard,, George, Laclavére, and, G., Le, Lionnaise;, (from, the, United, Kingdom), Ritchie, Calder,, H., Munro, Fox, and, Joseph, Needham;, and, (from, the, United, States), Robert, Oppenheimer., The, Academy, was, formally, founded, (and, its, first, officers, elected), in, 1960., They, were:, as, President,, Lord, John, Boyd, Orr, of, Scotland;, as, Vice, Presidents,, Hermann, Joseph, Muller, of, the, United, States,

They, defy, comprehension, and, resolution, based, on, the, prevailing, principles, of, social, science., The, specialized, knowledge, developed, by, separate, disciplines, is, inadequate, to, deal, with, the, increasingly, complex, interdependencies, of, the, real, world., Knowledge, needs, to, evolve, to, keep, pace, with, the, evolution, of, society., The, evolution, of, a, complex,, highly,

academies?, Is, there, really, a, common, meeting, point, between, art, and, science?, Is, there, a, unique, contribution, that, WAAS, can, make, to, the, world’s, knowledge?, At, the, New, Delhi, General, Assembly,, Fellows, explored, facets, of, a, new, program, framework, developed, by, the, Strategic, Planning, Committee, (SPC), which, seeks, to, answer, these, questions, in, the, affirmative., Rather, than, distinguish, itself, by, specializing, on, a, particular, set, of, disciplines,, issues, or, geographic, area,, the, framework, is, an, attempt, to, formulate, a, comprehensive, approach, and, integrated, perspective, of, knowledge, inclusive, of, all, disciplinary, perspectives, and, applicable, to, social, problems, and, opporunities, in, all, fields., The, core, of, the, framework, is, a, human-centered, conception, of, what, constitutes, reliable, knowing,, a, question, posed, to, the, SPC, by, Ruben, Nelson., In, his, presentation, to, the, GA,, Garry, Jacobs, explained, how, this, conception, applies, to, WAAS’s, projects, on, new, economic, theory,, individuality, and, limits, to, rationality., Pushpa, Bhargava, pointed, out, that, a,

following, the, end, of, the, Cold, War,, suddenly, surfaced, with, renewed, intensity, when, Korea, tested, nuclear, weapons, and, long, range, missiles, and, news, surfaced, of, Iran’s, secret, nuclear, weapons, program, in, 2007., Then, the, subprime, mortgage, crisis, exploded, in, late, 2008,, spreading, havoc, through, financial, markets, across, the, world., It, was, followed, quickly, by, a, sudden, and, substantial, slowing, of, economic, growth, in, OECD, countries,, rising, levels, of, unemployment, and, most, recently, a, crisis, of, excessive, government, debt., In, spite, of, the, enormous, attention, being, given, to, each, of, these, issues, by, specialists, nationally, and, internationally,, progress, on, all, fronts, appears, to, be, nearly, at, a, standstill, or, at,

activities, threatens, to, destabilize, and, undermine, the, remarkable, progress, of, the, previous, five, decades., This, project, is, predicated, on, the, assumption, that, each, of, these, problems, defies, solution, because, they, all, represent, problems, that, transcend, the, sovereign, powers, of, the, nation-state., None, of, them, can, be, fully, and, satisfactorily, addressed, by, nation-states, acting, individually., All, are, symptoms, of, the, evolution, of, world, society, to, a, stage, where, concerted, and, coordinated, global, action, is, required, to, meet, the,
