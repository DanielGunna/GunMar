[BIDDINGTON'S, ART, GALLERY--Contemporary, Paintings,, Sculpture, &, Prints.,   , CREATIVE, PROCESS--Artists', Studio, Visits., BIDDINGTON'S, Content, INDEX., Evaluating, Quality, in, Contemporary, Art, Rules, of, Thumb--those, pithy, sound-bites, of, distilled, experience--are, useful, decision-making, tools:, Buy, the, rumor,, sell, the, fact., Bulls, make, money,, bears, make, money,, pigs, get, slaughtered., Look, at, her, mother., In, the, complex, world, of, contemporary, art,, such, succinct, words, of, wisdom, are, scarce., Objectively, judging, the, art, of, ones, own, time, is, difficult,, but, deciding, where, hype, ends, and, art, begins, is, key, to, making, a, satisfying,, intelligent, art, acquisition., Happily,, the, extended, Biddington's, family, includes, people, who, not, only, make, art,, but, who, also, think, about, the, role, and, value, of, art, in, culture., An, artist, whose, perspective, I, especially, appreciate, once, suggested, to, me, 3, simple, rules, for, discerning, whether, or, not, an, artwork, has, what, it, takes, to, stand, the, test, of, time., If, you, are, considering, a, work, of, art, and, can't, quite, make, a, judgment, about, it,, try, using, the, PPP, Test, as, a, decision, screen:, PAST   PRESENT   PERSONAL, Contemporary, Art, Test, A, work, of, art, must, balance, three, elements, :, PAST--Does, it, understand, the, past?, PRESENT--Does, it, elucidate, the, present?, PERSONAL--Does, it, reflect, a, personal, vision?, An, artwork, too, involved, in, the, past, tends, to, be, derivative, and, insipidly, decorative., Whatever, the, genre,, it, is, not, art, but, just, a, pretty, picture., An, artwork, ignorant, of, visual, history, tends, to, be, naive, in, concept, and/or, realization., Amusing, and, childlike,, this, kind, of, art, fails, to, make, use, of, thousands, of, years, of, artistic, creation., Idiot, savantes, are, as, rare, in, art, as, they, are, elsewhere., An, artwork, too, much, of, its, time, is, immediately, attractive, but, doesn't, age, well., Lacking, a, universal, aspect, that, fine, art, embodies,, its, destiny, is, time-capsule, nostalgia., Several, over-hyped, contemporary, artists, come, to, mind., An, artwork, that, does, not, vibrate, with, its, time, fails, one, of, the, primary, missions, of, art:  to, be, a, predictive, and, interpretive, tool, of, the, culture., From, Michelangelo,, to, Vermeer,, to, Picasso,, to, Warhol--all, of, these, great, artists, resonated, like, tuning, forks, with, the, world, around, them., An, artwork, too, autobiographical, becomes, "dear, diary"., While, paintings, by, the, very, self-involved, or, the, insane, may, be, vivid, and, telling,, the, chronicle, of, a, personal, pathology, is, not, art., An, artwork, with, too, little, personal, imprint, lacks, originality, and, vision., This, failing, deprives, the, viewer, of, one, of, the, primary, joys, of, art:, to, leave, personal, limitations, behind, and, experience, the, world, through, another's, inciteful,, inventive, persona., Next, time, you, walk, into, a, gallery, and, can't, quite, connect, with, the, art,, try, testing, it, for, its, PAST  PRESENT  PERSONAL, balance., Odds, are,, you'll, get, a, feel, for, the, substance,, intent, and, quality, of, the, work, a, lot, more, quickly, than, usual., MORE, Jake:, PPP, Test:,
