For, the, past, two, years, or, so,, we, at, cMusicWeb, have, been, scheming., While, we�re, proud, of, what, we�ve, built, here, in, this, corner, of, the, web,, and, appreciate, the, thousands, of, you, who, support, us, by, visiting, each, month,, we, felt, it, was, necessary, to, reinvent, ourselves, a, little., So, we, held, a, contest,, asking, you, to, give, us, a, new, name, in, exchange, for, free, swag., You, answered, overwhelmingly,, but, we, decided, to, go, with, an, idea, that, had, been, bouncing, around, our, editing, scrums, for, a, while., And, the, idea, for, inReview.net, was, born., Our, website, has, always, been, driven, primarily, by, reviews�that�s, what, we, think, we, do, best�but, we�ve, always, been, about, more, than, Christian, music,, even, if, that�s, our, most, frequent, focus., So, if, you�re, wondering, why, we, opted, for, the, new, moniker,, that�s, essentially, it., And, while, �real, life�, has, often, gotten, in, the, way, of, our, desire, to, deliver, the, new, site,, our, owner, and, webmaster, Dan, Ficker, has, been, working, his, tail, off, to, meet, our, desire, to, bring, you, what, we�ve, been, promising, for, so, long, in, spring, 2006., The, time, has, come,, folks., inReview.net, is, here, --, albeit, not, entirely., When, you, visit, us, over, there, in, a, few, seconds,, you�ll, see, a, blog-style, site, that, gives, you, a, glimpse, of, what�s, to, come., It�s, not, perfect,, and, we�re, still, working, on, upgrading, it,, but, we�re, quite, excited, about, what, the, new, site, will, enable, us, to, do., We, hope, you, share, that, enthusiasm., Here�s, a, small, list, of, what, inReview, will, offer, but, cMW, couldn�t,, and, a, rundown, of, what, will, stay, the, same:, *, Because, the, new, site, is, blog-style,, all, of, our, staff, will, be, able, to, post, content, as, soon, as, it, has, passed, through, our, editing, system., Essentially, what, that, means, for, you, is, more, content, on, a, timelier, basis., *, Going, blog-style, also, means, you�ll, be, able, to, post, your, comments, (or, random, thoughts), at, the, bottom, of, each, article,, with, one, click, of, your, mouse., Love, us, or, hate, us,, it�s, all, good., Just, be, sure, we, know, what, we�re, doing, wrong, or, right., *On, that, note,, we, also, have, a, new, set, of, message, boards, in, the, Forum, section., This, was, an, underutilized, feature, on, cMusicWeb,, but, we, do, hope, you�ll, hit, us, (and, each, other), up, with, whatever, you, feel, like, talking, about, in, our, new, home., *, But, the, essence, of, what, we�re, about, won�t, change., We, continue, to, offer, the, most, incisive,, honest, and, highest-quality, reviews, of, anyone, who, covers, the, Christian, music, industry, while, never, confining, ourselves, to, that, industry., We, continue, to, bring, you, interviews, that, go, further, than, other, sites, do, and, ask, original,, thoughtful, questions., Our, approach, to, music, has, always, been, different,, and, it, will, continue, to, be, so., What, you, read, here, you, won�t, be, able, to, find, anywhere, else, That�s, about, it., As, mentioned,, it�s, a, work, in, progress,, but, we�re, definitely, keyed, up, about, it., Continue, to, check, cMusicWeb.com, for, archived, reviews,, artist, pages,, interviews,, columns, and, features,, but, check, inReview.net, regularly, for, new, stuff., Actually,, NOW, would, be, a, good, time., Thanks, again, for, your, time, and, support., We�re, blessed, and, we, know, it., Sincerely,, The, Staff, of,
