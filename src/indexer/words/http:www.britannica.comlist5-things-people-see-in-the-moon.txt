List, 7, Deadliest, Weapons, in, History, ©, 1902, Star, Film, The, Moon, keeps, one, side, facing, Earth, because, its, rotation, period, is, the, same, as, its, orbital, period., The, Earth-facing, side,, the, near, side,, is, splotched, with, dark, spots, called, maria, (Latin, for, “seas”),, which, are, the, remnants, of, giant, volcanic, eruptions, that, happened, early, in, the, Moon’s, history., There, was, no, pattern, to, these, eruptions,, but, as, people, see, figures, in, natural, phenomena, like, clouds, and, rock, formations,, so, too, have, they, seen, figures, in, the, Moon., Here, are, some, of, the, most, notable., 1The, Man, in, the, Moon, The, most, famous, of, these, lunar, pareidolia, (the, name, for, seeing, a, pattern, where, there, isn’t, one), is, the, man, in, the, moon., The, man, in, the, moon, is, either, the, face, or, the, body, of, a, man,, but, usually, the, chief, representation, is, of, a, face,, such, as, the, one, that, got, a, rocket, in, the, eye, in, George, Méliès’s, early, film, masterpiece, A, Trip, to, the, Moon, (1902)., However,, sometimes, a, whole, human, figure, is, seen,, usually, carrying, sticks, or, thorns., Shakespeare, mentions, this, burden, in, A, Midsummer, Night’s, Dream:, “I,, the, man, in, the, moon;, this, thorn-bush,, my, thorn-bush.”, 2The, Woman, in, the, Moon, Others, have, seen, a, woman, in, the, Moon., The, Samoans, tell, the, story, of, Sina,, who, once, during, a, famine, was, outside, at, night, pounding, bark, into, cloth, with, a, mallet, and, board., The, Moon, rose,, and, its, appearance, reminded, her, of, a, giant, breadfruit., Sina, said, to, the, Moon,, “Why, can’t, you, come, down,, and, let, my, hungry, child, have, a, bite, of, you?”, The, Moon, was, greatly, offended, but, came, down, nevertheless,, only, to, take, Sina,, her, child,, mallet,, and, board, back, up, into, the, sky., 3The, Rabbit, in, the, Moon, Several, cultures, see, a, rabbit, in, the, Moon,, with, the, Sea, of, Tranquility, (where, Apollo, 11, landed), as, the, rabbit’s, head, and, the, Seas, of, Nectar, and, Fertility, as, the, rabbit’s, ears., Why, is, the, rabbit, in, the, Moon?, In, a, Sri, Lankan, legend,, Buddha, was, once, lost, in, a, forest,, and, a, rabbit, told, him, the, way, out., Buddha, thanked, the, rabbit, and, said, that, he, was, poor, and, hungry, and, thus, unable, to, repay, him., “If, you, are, hungry,”, said, the, rabbit,, “light, a, fire, and, kill,, cook,, and, eat, me.”, Buddha, made, a, fire., The, rabbit, jumped, in., Buddha, pulled, the, rabbit, out, and, placed, him, in, the, Moon., (Similar, tales, are, told, in, other, cultures, about, a, rabbit’s, sacrifice.), In, China,, the, rabbit, Yutu, helped, the, moon, goddess, Chang’e, when, she, was, pursued, by, her, lover,, Hou, Yi,, after, she, took, the, immortality, elixir, that, the, gods, gave, him., The, Chinese, space, program, immortalized, this, legend, by, calling, their, lunar, spacecraft, Chang’e, and, the, rover, that, Chang’e, 3, placed, on, the, Moon, Yutu., 4The, Toad, in, the, Moon, In, another, variant, of, the, Chang’e, story,, Chang’e, drinks, the, immortality, elixir, and, is, changed, into, a, toad., The, Salish, people, of, the, Pacific, Coast, of, North, America, tell, the, story, of, a, wolf’s, love, for, the, toad., Once, upon, a, time,, the, wolf, fell, madly, in, love, with, the, toad., The, toad, did, not, trust, the, wolf, and, went, into, hiding., The, wolf, was, disconsolate,, and, one, night, the, wolf, prayed, to, the, Moon, to, shine, brightly, on, the, world, so, he, could, find, his, beloved, toad., The, wolf, saw, where, the, toad, was, hiding, and, chased, her, all, night., Just, as, the, wolf, was, about, to, catch, her,, the, toad, made, one, last, desperate, giant, leap…and, landed, on, the, Moon,, where, she, remains, to, this, day., 5The, Name, in, the, Moon, Some, Shiʿite, Muslims, believe, that, the, pattern, on, the, Moon, is, not, a, person, or, an, animal, but, the, name, of, Ali,, who, was, the, son-in-law, of, Muhammad., Ali, lived, from, about, 600, to, 661, CE, and, was, the, fourth, successor, of, Muhammad., Shiʿites, regard, that, only, Ali, and, his, line, could, be, the, true, caliphs., Such, a, pattern, is, seen, as, confirmation, of, the, hadith, (saying, of, Muhammad), that, he, was, like, the, Sun, and, Ali, was, like, the, Moon., Previous, List, Our, Days, Are, Numbered, Facts, About, Calendars, Next, List, 7, Winter, Solstice, Celebrations, From, Around, the,
