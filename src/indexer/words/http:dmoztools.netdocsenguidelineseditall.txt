editorial, integrity., Editall, privileges, are, granted, to, experienced, editors, who, have, exhibited, a, solid, grasp, of, the, DMOZ, Guidelines, and, excellent, editorial, skills, in, diverse, areas, of, the, directory. , Editalls, lead, the, community, by:, Keeping, "the, big, picture", in, mind, when, making, editing, decisions., Productively, participating, in, the, community, decision-making, process., Creating, user-friendly, taxonomies, that, have, sound,, logical, structure., Adding, content, that, is, current, and, relevant, to, users., Maintaining, a, consistent, edit, history, that, reflects, an, overall, understanding, of, general, and, category-specific, editorial, guidelines., Types, of, Editall, Permissions, Standard, Editall, -, Editalls, are, able, to, perform, the, following, functions:, Edit, anywhere, in, the, directory,, except, in, restricted, areas., Read, and, post, in, the, p-editall, private, editor, forum, Delete, any, category, which, contains, no, listed, or, unreviewed, sites., Create, a, new, category, and, request, up, to, 1, person, as, editor., Editall/Catmv, -, In, addition, to, all, standard, editall, functions,, an, Editall, with, Catmv, can, rename, or, move, any, category,, except, in, restricted, access, areas., CatEditall, -, This, type, of, editor, can, perform, Editall/Catmv, functions, within, a, specific, category, or, directory, node., This, permission, is, limited, to, editors, listed, under, one, of, the, main,, top, level, categories., In, the, World, branch,, Cateditall, may, be, granted, to, editors, listed, under, World/<language>, or, World/<language>/<topic>., In, exceptional, cases,, Cateditall, may, be, granted, to, an, editor, leading, a, category, reorganization, below, one, of, these, levels., You, are, not, required, to, have, top, level, permissions, prior, to, being, granted, Cateditall, permissions., You, may, be, granted, cateditall, and, top, level, permissions, simultaneously.,  However,, cateditall, is, only, granted, to, those, who, have, broad, editing, experience, in, a, main, category., Stuff, Editalls, Do, There, is, no, specific, time, commitment, required, of, editalls,, although, editall, privileges, are, generally, given, to, active, editors, interested, in, assuming, lead, roles, in, building, and, maintaining, the, directory., Depending, on, personal, tastes, and, skills, and, the, directory's, needs,, editalls, can, make, notable, contributions, by, working, in, one, or, more, of, these, areas:, Edit, in, very, broad, areas, of, their, choice,, driven, by, personal, interest, and/or, a, knowledge, of, where, help, is, needed, most., Coordinate, reorganizations, of, sites, and, categories, across, or, within, the, various, top, level, directory, nodes., Coordinate, and, participate, in, directory, wide, editorial, initiatives, aimed, at, growing, the, directory's, content, (e.g., team, evaluation, of, unreviewed), and, improving, its, quality., Act, as, authorities, on, matters, of, standard, editing,, taxonomy, and, ontology, policies, and, procedures,, resolving, questions, about, editing, practice, and, application/interpretation, of, editing, guidelines., Mentor, less, experienced, editors, on, community, standards, and, guidelines., Investigate, abuse, and, questionable, editing, practices,, bringing, them, to, the, attention, of, metas,, catmods, and, admins., Perform, change/move/delete, requests,, and, general, data, quality, assurance, and, maintenance., Editalls, have, information, organization, skills, that, transcend, specific, subject, knowledge,, qualifying, them, to, edit, in, broad, areas, of, the, directory., However,, as, the, directory, grows, and, becomes, more, diverse,, it, is, not, possible, for, one, person, to, remain, completely, informed, about, all, community, standards, that, govern, more, granular, levels, of, the, directory's, structure., Therefore,, editalls, are, not, expected, to, edit, everywhere., When, editing, in, an, unfamiliar, area,, editalls, must, take, time, to, learn, local, editing, practices, such, as, deeplinking, and, cross, listing, policies,, standardized, templates,, site, title, and, description, practices,, regional, variations, in, standard, English,, and, the, like., Although, editalls, can, edit, in, any, part, of, the, directory, without, being, listed, as, editor,, they, should, always, be, listed, as, editor, of, at, least, one, category, in, the, public, directory., As, with, any, other, editor,, resigning, all, categories, is, assumed, to, be, a, resignation, from, DMOZ., The, Editall, Interface, Editalls, have, access, to, a, number, of, powerful, editing, tools., In, addition, to, the, standard, system, tools,, a, variety, of, editor, developed, bookmarklets,, tools,, and, documents, are, available, at, Test:, Tools, for, Editors:, Tools, for, Editalls, to, facilitate, using, editall, permissions, responsibly, and, effectively., The, Editall, Dashboard, The, editall/catmv, dashboard, contains, the, following, additions, to, the, standard, editor, dashboard:, Links, to, all, top, level, categories, at, the, bottom, of, the, dashboard., A, link, to, these, guidelines., The, Editall, Category, Edit, Screen, The, editall/catmv, category, edit, screen, contains, the, following, additions, to, the, regular, edit, screen:, "Move/rename, this, Category", option, in, the, list, at, the, top., "Change, search, string", option, in, the, list, at, the, top., Catmv, and, Delete, links, next, to, @links., The, "Power, Reviewed, Edit", option,, which, brings, up, a, different, edit, screen, for, the, same, category., The, Editall, URL, Edit, Screen, Editalls, can, add, colored, notes, to, domains., See, Adding, Notes, to, URLs, for, information, and, procedures., Moving, and, Renaming, Categories, Major, category, moves, and, renames, should, not, be, arbitrary,, but, should, reflect, a, clear, community, consensus,, standard, template,, or, general, editing, guideline., Generally,, moves, are, agreed, on, in, forum, discussion, and, then, posted, to, a, central, Rename/Move/Change, thread, for, action,, with, references, to, the, thread, where, changes, were, discussed., In, some, topical, areas,, there, are, established, procedures, for, minor, changes,, such, as, posting, intended, changes, to, a, central, "Category, Create/Delete, Billboard", forum, thread, to, solicit, comments., While, you, are, expected, to, use, your, judgment, in, performing, minor, changes,, such, as, bringing, a, category, into, conformity, with, an, established, template, or, correcting, spelling, or, capitalization, errors,, if, there, is, any, doubt, about, a, change, it, should, always, be, discussed, and, agreed, upon, in, the, forum., How, to, Move/Rename, a, Category, To, move, a, category:, Go, to, the, category, edit, page, of, the, category, you, wish, to, move., Select, "Move/rename, this, category"., Enter, a, destination,, and, select, Apply., Check, the, details, on, the, next, screen,, if, they, are, correct,, choose, Confirm,, else, go, back, in, your, browser,, and, correct, the, destination, path., The, request, is, then, executed,, though, it's, always, wise, to, check, that, the, results, are, as, intended., Renaming, a, category, is, exactly, the, same, as, moving, a, category,, you, simply, change, only, the, last, part, of, the, destination, category., Things, to, Watch, Out, For, The, destination, path, should, be, entered, using, "/", and, "_",, not, ":", and, ", "., It, is, especially, important, to, watch, out, for, spaces, when, carrying, out, requests, in, a, forum, rename/move, request, thread., It, is, very, easy, to, end, up, with, an, incorrectly, named, category., Occasionally,, a, glitch, in, the, catmv, system, can, lead, to, editor, names, being, lost, when, a, category, is, moved., A, meta, can, easily, restore, editing, privileges, lost, in, a, catmv., Sort, priority, is, not, automatically, updated, after, a, category, move,, so, you, may, need, to, check, this, after, renaming, or, moving, a, category., If, an, error, page, is, displayed,, first, try, refreshing, the, page, -, If, that, doesn't, work,, please, post, in, the, Bugs, &, Features, forum., How, to, Move/Rename, @Links, To, move, an, @link:, Go, to, the, category, edit, page, containing, the, @link, you, want, to, move., Select, the, "[catmv, link]", link, next, to, the, @link., Enter, a, destination,, and, select, "Apply"., Check, the, details, on, the, next, screen,, if, they, are, correct,, choose, Confirm,, else, go, back, in, your, browser,, and, correct, the, destination, path., The, @link, is, moved, immediately., Renaming, an, @link, is, exactly, the, same, as, moving, an, @link,, you, simply, change, only, the, last, part, of, the, destination, category., Deleting, Categories, Editalls, are, able, to, delete, categories, with, resident, editors,, as, long, as, there, are, no, subcategories,, @links, or, sites, listed, in, the, category., However,, this, action, should, be, taken, only, with, extreme, caution;, it, is, almost, never, appropriate,, except, as, part, of, an, agreed, upon, category, merge,, or, when, deleting, wildly, inappropriate, subcategories., Like, all, editors,, editalls, should, be, careful, about, deleting, categories, that, may, be, linked, to, from, other, parts, of, the, directory,, or, which, may, represent, a, substantial, amount, of, work, in, creating, category, charters,, FAQs,, or, collections, of, @links,, related, category, links,, or, language, groups., The, editall, tools, category, contains, advice, on, how, to, preserve, as, much, work, as, possible, when, merging, or, reorganizing, categories., Except, for, more, obvious, cases,, it's, strongly, recommended, to, discuss, category, deletions, in, the, forums, beforehand,, and, gain, consensus, before, acting,, like, with, category, creation., Naming, Editors, to, New, Categories, Note:, In, the, original, software,, an, Editall, could, directly, grant, a, category, to, an, editor, as, part, of, the, category, creation, process., For, technical, reasons,, this, feature, did, not, get, carried, into, the, 2.0, (and, later)., The, ability, of, editalls, to, name, editors, to, newly, created, categories, should, be, used, very, selectively., It, is, not, intended, to, give, editalls, meta-like, abilities, to, decide, on, the, promotion, and, expansion, of, the, responsibilities, of, editors,, but, merely, to, complement, the, natural, role, of, editalls, in, facilitating, category, reorganizations, and, growth., Carefully, review, an, editor's, edit, history, before, taking, this, step., If, there, is, any, doubt,, decisions, should, be, left, to, meta, editors, or, catmods., Some, of, the, things, that, editalls, should, consider, in, naming, editors, to, new, categories:, Is, the, editor, doing, a, good, job, in, their, current, categories?, Has, the, editor, been, recently, rejected, for,, or, removed, from,, any, categories, by, meta-editors, or, catmods?, Is, the, new, category, the, subject, of, any, larger, controversy?, Are, reorganizations, ongoing, that, would, take, away, the, ability, of, a, parent, editor, to, work, on, subcats, they, are, currently, maintaining?, Does, the, editor, have, the, level, of, experience, necessary, for, the, expected, size, of, the, new, category?, Do, the, editor's, forum, postings, in, the, discussion, leading, to, the, creation, of, this, category, show, an, ability, to, cooperatively, work, for, the, better, of, the, directory?, If, the, category, is, in, Test,, is, it, intended, to, allow, one, or, more, editors, to, work, on, a, category, reorganization, or, other, temporary, project,, or, is, it, intended, to, be, moved, into, the, main, directory?, Is, the, editor, expecting, to, be, named, to, this, category?, (Don't, give, an, editor, an, unexpected, surprise, on, their, dashboard.), Again,, if, there, is, any, doubt, or, controversy,, or, if, you, are, not, comfortable, naming, editors, to, categories,, the, decision, should, be, left, to, a, meta, editor, or, catmod., How, to, Name, an, Editor, to, a, Category, Create, a, new, subcategory, as, usual,, then, place, a, request, in, the, dedicated, forum, thread., Changing, Category, Search, Strings, To, change, a, category, search, string:, Go, to, the, category, edit, page, of, the, category., Select, "Change, search, string"., Enter, the, search, string, in, the, "Search, String", box., This, is, the, string, that, will, be, used, for, the, external, search, engine, links., Enter, the, public, string, in, the, "Public, String", box., This, will, appear, as, the, caption, on, the, public, page,, in, the, form, "Public, String", search, on:,, and, also, next, to, the, "Change, search, string", option, on, the, edit, page., Click, Apply, It's, always, a, good, idea, to, test, the, modified, search, string, in, one, or, more, search, engines., Power, Reviewed, Edit, Power, reviewed, edit,, also, known, as, the, chainsaw,, can, be, accessed, by, selecting, the, 'Power, Reviewed, Edit', link, on, a, category, edit, page., This, feature, works, much, like, power, unreviewed, edit., You, can, go, from, power, reviewed, edit, to, the, standard, edit, page, by, choosing, "Old, Style, Reviewed, Edit"., "Cancel", will, reset, all, titles/descriptions/checkboxes, to, what, they, were, the, last, time, you, loaded, the, power, reviewed, edit, page., "Clear, Marked, Sites", will, untick, all, the, check, boxes., You, can, enter, a, note, into, the, "DMOZ, Note", field,, which, will, be, attached, to, all, edits, made, by, your, next, update/unreview/move, made, with, power, reviewed, edit., Mass, Unreviewing/Moving, Select, the, sites, you, wish, to, unreview/move, by, ticking, the, check, box, next, to, the, site., Choose, a, category,, either, by, typing, one, into, the, appropriate, box,, or, choosing, one, from, the, pull, down, menu., Select, "Move, selected, URLs", to, move, the, URLs, and, list, them, in, the, destination, category,, or, "Move, URLs, to, Unreviewed", to, move, the, URLs, to, the, destination, category's, unreviewed, queue., Note:, There, is, also, an, "Unreview, Marked, Sites", button, which, places, the, selected, sites, into, the, unreviewed, queue, of, the, current, category., Mass, Updating, Titles/Descriptions, Change, the, titles/descriptions, as, appropriate, by, altering, the, values, in, the, text, boxes., Choose, the, sites, you, wish, to, update, by, ticking, the, check, boxes, next, to, the, sites., Select, "Update, Titles/Descriptions.", Adding, Notes, to, URLs, The, colored, notes, at, the, top, of, the, "edit, URL", screen, communicate, important, information, about, a, particular, URL, or, web, site., All, (k)editalls, and, (k)cateditalls, may, post, URL, notes,, without, discussion., If, you, have, questions, about, which, color, is, appropriate, for, a, specific, site,, or, group, of, sites,, please, discuss, it, in, the, appropriate, p-editall, thread., Guideline:, Add, Note, to, URL, Feature, -, Power, Tool:, Spiegel, Editall, Projects, As, an, Editall,, you, have, the, opportunity, to, take, part, in, a, number, of, projects, that, seek, to, improve, the, quality, and, quantity, of, the, directory., You, are, not, required, to, participate, in, organized, editing, initiatives;, however,, as, an, Editall,, the, DMOZ, community, does, expect, you, to, be, actively, editing, across, the, various, subject, categories., Any, time, you, can, devote, to, directory, wide, editing, projects, is, appreciated., As, a, leader, in, the, community,, you, are, in, a, unique, position, to, seize, new, opportunities, and, fill, in, gaps, where, you, see, them., New, ideas, for, growing, and, developing, DMOZ's, content, and, improving, its, quality, are, encouraged., All, Editalls, are, encouraged, to, take, part, in, editing, projects,, and, contribute, their, expertise, in, all, areas, of, the, directory., Last, update:, Mon, Aug, 29, 13:49, EDT, 2016, Copyright, ©, 2016, AOL, Inc., (Terms, of, Use, -, License)]
