[9/21/09, Erecting, a, TV, Antenna,  , If, you, have, been, told, that, you, may, not, erect, a, small, outdoor, TV, antenna,, that, is, probably, wrong. , The, Telecommunications, Act, of, 1996, has, a, provision, that, preempts, (overrules), nearly, all, local, restrictions, such, as, deed, restrictions,, home-owners, association, rules,, renters, contracts,, and, so, on. , For, more, details, see, FCC, Fact, Sheet.,  , Late, news: , Note, that, now, is, not, a, good, time, to, buy, a, Yagi, antenna. , Present, Yagi, antennas, are, optimized, for, channel, 69. , But, in, the, U.S.,  51, is, now, the, highest, channel,, and, a, new, generation, of, Yagi, antennas, cut, for, channel, 51, will, be, the, most, desirable. , For, the, next, few, years, Yagi, buyers, must, pay, close, attention, to, the, frequency, specs.,  , Many, people, live, in, areas, where, TV, signals, are, strong. , Even, if, these, people, know, nothing, about, selecting, or, installing, an, antenna,, they, will, probably, succeed, anyway. , This, website, is, written, mainly, for, people, in, areas, where, reception, is, nontrivial, to, very, difficult. , A, trip, to, the, website, www.antennaweb.org, will, tell, you, quickly, into, which, group, you, fall. , If, your, must-have, stations, are, in, the, yellow, or, olive-green, range, then, there, is, not, much, reason, to, study, anything. , (But, if, your, present, antenna, is, disappointing, then, read, on.),  , If, you, are, not, a, do-it-yourself, type,, you, can, find, an, installer, in, the, Yellow, Pages, under, “Antennas”, (or, possibly, “Televisions, –, Dealers, &, Services”). , The, total, cost, (parts, and, labor), will, range, from, $100, for, an, easy, install, to, $800, for, a, difficult, install,, with, $300, being, the, most, typical, bill. , If, you, do, it, yourself,, you, will, pay, almost, $200, just, for, the, hardware. , (Antenna:, $70,, amplifier:, $70,, 50, feet, of, RG-6:, $30) , You, might, be, able, to, get, some, free, advice, or, a, free, rough, estimate, over, the, phone, or, by, visiting, the, installer’s, shop. , If, he, comes, to, your, home,, the, estimate, will, not, be, free, but, it, will, be, accurate.,  , There, is, a, chance, that, the, first, antenna, you, install, will, not, meet, your, expectations. , Once, an, outdoor, antenna, has, been, installed,, the, seller, will, rarely, take, it, back. , Even, Radio, Shack, will, not, take, back, an, installed, outdoor, antenna. , The, cost, of, a, second, antenna, might, wipe, out, any, savings, you, hoped, for, by, doing, it, yourself. , An, installer, will, never, charge, you, for, two, antennas, if, he, is, wrong, on, the, first, try. , Generally,, indoor, antennas, can, be, returned, if, in, the, original, packaging.,  , Proceed, at, your, own, risk:, ·        , Every, year, people, get, killed, while, erecting, antennas., ·        , There, are, places, within, the, station’s, broadcast, radius, where, reception, is, not, possible., ·        , There, are, places, where, reception, is, so, difficult, that, the, challenge, might, outwit, the, installer., ·        , Although, the, dollar, cost, of, an, antenna, system, is, modest,, a, lot, of, your, time, might, be, required.,  , The, author, will, not, accept, responsibility, for, any, unexpected, losses.,  , The, following, antenna, sections,, like, the, rest, of, the, primer,, assume, only, a, high, school, education. , But, you, will, find, them, to, be, slightly, more, technically, challenging.,  , Antenna, Issues:,
