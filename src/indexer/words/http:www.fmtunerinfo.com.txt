an, elite, team, of, trusted, contributors, have, personally, used, and, reviewed, hundreds, of, different, FM, tuners., We're, also, requesting, input, from, readers, on, about, 200, more, tuners, listed, in, the, On-Deck, Circle,, some, of, which, will, be, added, to, the, review, pages, once, first-hand, information, is, obtained, and, as, our, Editor's, time, permits., We, focus, on, tuners,, rather, than, receivers,, because, (a), very, few, receivers, come, close, to, matching, the, performance, of, that, manufacturer's, top, tuners,, and, (b), we, stick, to, what, we, know, best., Our, primary, emphasis, is, on, tuners, that, were, manufactured, between, the, early, 1970s, and, the, early, '90s,, before, home, theater, receivers, largely, replaced, separate, stereo, components., We, will, review, tuners, of, more, recent, vintage,, but, do, not, seek, them, out, as, fervently, as, we, do, the, older, stuff., Specs, Your, own, experience, with, a, particular, tuner, will, depend,, to, some, extent,, on, reception, conditions, in, your, local, area., For, example,, a, listener, in, a, metropolitan, area, where, strong, local, stations, crowd, the, FM, band, will, need, a, tuner, with, excellent, selectivity, if, he, or, she, wishes, to, receive, any, of, the, more, distant, stations, between, the, locals., (Alternate, channel, selectivity, is, the, measurement, of, a, tuner's, ability, to, reject, an, interfering, signal, 400, kHz,, or, .4, MHz,, away, from, the, station, you're, trying, to, hear., Adjacent, channel, selectivity,, rarely, quoted, in, manufacturers', specs,, refers, to, rejection, of, a, station, only, 200, kHz,, or, 0.2, MHz,, away, from, the, one, you're, tuned, to.), Overload, rejection, and, image, rejection, are, other, important, considerations, for, listeners, who, live, close, to, stations', transmitters., Listeners, in, more, remote, or, rural, areas,, however,, will, generally, be, more, concerned, with, sensitivity,, which, is, the, tuner's, ability, to, clearly, receive, weak, stations', signals., Many, tuners, with, good, sensitivity, can, be, modified, to, be, more, selective,, but, poor, sensitivity, cannot, easily, be, improved, upon., See, the, Better, FM, page, for, info, on, diagnosing, and, correcting, FM, reception, problems., Manufacturers', own, specifications, for, sensitivity, and, selectivity, are, sometimes, imprecise, or, exaggerated,, and, even, two, examples, of, the, same, model, tuner, may, be, very, different, in, performance, (especially, when, they're, 20, or, 30, years, old!)., Also,, a, tuner, that, is, out, of, alignment, will, not, function, properly;, Stereophile's, reviewers, even, used, to, receive, brand-new, misaligned, review, samples, occasionally., For, what, they're, worth,, key, specs, for, many, top, tuners, may, be, compared, on, the, Specs, Database, page., One, important, reception, characteristic, of, a, tuner, that, is, often, overlooked,, and, rarely, listed, accurately, on, a, spec, sheet,, is, the, tuner's, ability, to, handle, strong, signals, that, can, create, mixing, products., The, typical, problem, occurs, when, two, or, more, strong, local, stations, on, different, frequencies,, as, a, result, of, non-linear, effects, in, the, tuner,, combine, to, create, a, distorted, signal, at, another, frequency, that, is, stronger, than, the, station, that, should, be, there., This, usually, happens, when, the, RF, gain, transistor, and/or, mixer, is, driven, to, overload, and, creates, harmonics, of, a, local, station., These, harmonics, then, mix, with, other, strong, stations, to, create, ghost, stations, in, the, amp, or, mixer., In, very, dense, urban, markets,, the, harmonics, created, can, be, so, numerous, as, to, create, an, overall, increase, in, noise, on, all, stations., In, FM, tuners,, the, most, common, RFIM, distortion, results, from, two, stations, mixing, together, in, the, relationship, 2*f1-f2, or, 2*f2-f1., The, most, troublesome, mixing, products, are, caused, by, very, strong, stations, that, are, close, to, each, other, in, frequency,, and, also, close, to, a, desired, weaker, station., This, is, because, RF, gangs, are, generally, 2-3, MHz, wide,, and, most, tuners, have, only, one, gang, in, front, of, the, first, RF, amp, (although, better, tuners, have, two, gangs, before, the, RF, amp)., When, the, gangs, cannot, attenuate, undesirable, strong, signals,, the, ability, of, the, RF, amp, and, mixer, to, withstand, RFIM, is, tested., For, example,, subtracting, 93.3, from, the, second, harmonic, of, 94.1, would, yield, a, mixing, product, at, 94.9,, and, there, are, other, possibilities, like, f1, +, f2, -, f3., These, stations, are, all, so, close, in, frequency, that, one, gang, of, the, front, end, will, do, little, to, attenuate, them., In, cases, like, this,, using, a, directional, external, antenna, is, the, best, way, to, prevent, the, unwanted, stations, from, overloading, the, front, end., Many, tuners, also, have, provision, for, handling, strong, RF, signals,, which, usually, means, circuits, to, bypass, RF, amps,, add, attenuation,, or, both., The, problem, with, this, is, that, the, weak, station, you, want, to, listen, to, also, gets, less, gain/attenuated., It, should, be, noted,, though,, that, this, scenario, in, which, all, three, stations, are, less, than, 2, MHz, apart, is, the, worst, case., Usually, the, strong, signals, are, farther, apart, in, frequency,, or, farther, away, from, the, one, you, are, trying, to, listen, to,, and, then, the, gangs, will, do, their, job, and, attenuate, strong, offending, stations., All, other, things, being, equal,, two, bandpass, filters, will, have, better, out-of-band, rejection, than, one,, and, for, this, reason, two, gangs, before, the, RF, amp, is, preferred, over, one, in, very, strong, signal, environments., Mixing, products, can, be, referred, to, in, many, ways, -, intermod,, IMD, (intermodulation, distortion),, RFIM, (RF, intermodulation),, third-order, IM,, etc., A, calculation, of, how, an, individual, amp,, mixer,, or, composite, RF, stage, can, handle, third-order, RFIM,, called, "IP3", (third-order, intermodulation, product),, is, a, combination, of, measurement, and, graphical, extrapolation,, usually, expressed, in, dBm, (the, higher, the, better)., In, tuner, specs,, in, theory,, the, ANSI/IEEE, 185-1975, tuner, spec, for, Spurious, Response, Ratio, (6.15.1), should, capture, the, worst, case, of, three, individual, measurements,, one, of, which, is, a, very, difficult, third-order, RFIM, measurement, (section, 6.16,, RF, Intermodulation,, where, two, RF, generators,, one, at, 98.8, and, the, other, at, 99.6, MHz,, are, used, while, monitoring, 98, MHz, for, interference)., For, some, reason,, based, on, a, survey, of, tuner, owners, and, written, opinions, of, others, like, David, Rich,, it, does, not., Perhaps, the, wording, of, the, spec, itself,, confusing, at, best,, is, to, blame., Or, perhaps, creative, marketing, departments, chose, to, interpret, the, spec, to, mean, the, best,, not, worst,, of, the, three, measurements., A, few, tuner, companies, do, break, out, and, independently, specify, third-order, RFIM;, Accuphase,, for, example,, lists, 80, dB, for, the, T-109V., For, most, tuners,, however,, field, testing, under, actual, conditions, appears, to, be, the, best, way, to, determine, resistance, to, strong-signal, overload,, unless, you, have, access, to, RF, instruments, and, can, perform, the, RFIM, measurements, yourself., In, general,, many,, but, not, all,, older, tuners, designed, before, the, modern, FM, station, congestion, can, have, problems, with, RFIM., This, would, seem, to, include, models, like, the, Marantz, 10B,, according, to, personal, accounts, by, some, of, our, contributors,, who, said, the, Scott, 310, series, had, much, better, RFIM, performance., Our, panelist, David, "Anonymous", adds,, "The, problem, of, RFIM, is, caused, fundamentally, by, too, much, gain, and, not, enough, selectivity, in, the, front, end., It, is, worsened, by, adding, an, RF, amp, in, front, of, any, tuner, even, if, there, are, tuned, elements, in, front, of, it., Also,, the, use, of, RF, AGC, worsens, the, problem, and, can, create, additional, harmonics., Therefore,, having, two, or, even, three, tuning, elements, (caps, or, varactors), prior, to, any, RF, amplifier, elements, helps, a, great, deal, because, it, limits, the, bandwidth, coming, in, and, therefore, the, total, energy, being, directed, at, the, RF, amp(s), and, the, mixer., This, is, correctly, called, RFIM, and, is, usually, specified, as, a, level, of, attenuation, relative, to, a, certain, deviation, from, the, tuned, center, frequency., It, is, important, to, understand, that, a, 7, effective, gang, tuner, that, is, arranged, as, 3, tuning, elements,, an, RF, amp,, 3, elements,, a, mixer, and, a, single, element, for, the, local, oscillator, will, radically, outperform, a, 7-gang, tuner, that, has, 1, element,, an, RF, amp,, 2, elements,, another, RF, amp,, 2, elements,, a, mixer, and, 2, tuned, elements, for, the, LO., Also,, a, tuner, with, a, single, properly, designed, RF, amp, will, always, outperform, another, tuner, with, two, RF, amps, in, terms, of, the, RFIM, parameter., In, addition,, unless, varactors, are, very, carefully, selected, and, designed,, there, is, fundamentally, more, front-end, selectivity, when, one, uses, tuning, capacitors.", Our, contributor, Brian, Beezley,, however,, disagrees, with, David, on, one, point:, "RF, AGC, does, not, necessarily, worsen, RF, intermod., If, the, intermod, originates, in, the, mixer,, AGC, will, help,, not, hurt., This, is, the, usual, case., For, example,, when, I, added, RF, AGC, to, my, Kenwood, KT-7500,, stations, that, were, obliterated, by, RF, intermod, popped, out, of, the, grunge, and, became, listenable.", Ken, Wetzel,, an, RF, engineer,, posted, in, our, FMtuners, group, about, the, effects, of, antenna, amplifiers, on, RF, intermod:, "The, part, of, the, tuner, most, vulnerable, to, 'overload',, or, the, creation, of, IM, spurious, signals,, is, the, mixer., The, more, gain, that, precedes, the, mixer,, the, more, IM, the, mixer, will, create., The, IM, created, in, the, input, RF, amplifier, of, the, tuner, is, generally, insignificant, compared, to, what's, created, in, the, mixer., Overload, in, the, IF, amplifier, of, an, FM, tuner, will, not, be, noticeable, except, with, laboratory, instrumentation., RF, engineers, use, the, 'third, order, intercept, point', (IP3), as, a, figure, of, merit, of, an, RF, component's, susceptibility, to, creation, of, IM., The, higher, the, IP3, number,, the, better., I've, measured, the, IP3, of, a, few, tuners, and, found, a, wide, variation., A, Technics, ST-9030, had, an, IP3, of, +6, dBm,, while, a, Kenwood, KT-7500, had, an, IP3, of, -21, dBm,, with, other, good, tuners, falling, between, those, two., Those, values, are, for, undesired, signals, 400, kHz, apart, (alternate, channel, spacing)., For, signals, with, a, spacing, of, 1, MHz, or, more,, the, IP3, performance, improves, dramatically., As, far, as, antenna, amplifiers, go,, I, haven't, measured, consumer-grade, units,, just, a, couple, of, communications-grade, units., The, IP3, of, an, FM, head-end, preamp, was, +20, dBm,, and, the, IP3, of, a, GaAs, pHEMT, preamp, was, +11, dBm., I, would, guess, that, a, consumer-grade, antenna, preamp, would, be, in, the, range, of, 0, dBm., The, bottom, line:, Any, gain, added, before, an, FM, tuner, will, degrade, its, IM, performance., For, signals, closely, spaced,, IM, performance, will, be, limited, by, the, tuner,, degraded, by, the, added, gain, of, the, antenna, amplifier., For, signals, widely, spaced,, IM, performance, will, be, limited, by, the, (consumer-grade), antenna, amplifier., So, we, understand, what, we're, talking, about,, the, effect, of, inadequate, IM, performance, of, an, FM, tuner, will, be, the, creation, of, signals, at, the, wrong, frequencies, across, the, dial., Those, false, signals, are, usually, very, distorted., If, the, frequency, where, a, false, signal, is, created, happens, to, be, your, favorite, low-power, college, jazz, station,, the, effect, will, be, elevated, background, noise,, especially, in, stereo.", Gangs, &, Filters, Gangs:, In, our, reviews,, we, usually, mention, the, number, of, FM, (front-end), tuning, elements, in, a, tuner,, when, known., These, elements, can, be, either, variable, capacitors, or, diodes, that, vary, capacitance, as, a, function, of, voltage,, known, as, varactor, diodes., As, a, general, rule,, older, tuners, typically, have, variable, capacitors, and, newer, ones, tend, to, use, varactor, diodes,, but, there, are, exceptions, to, both., The, term, "gangs", refers, to, individual, capacitors, physically, tied, together, such, that, they, all, change, capacitance, when, the, tuning, mechanism, is, actuated., We, may, refer, to, both, varactors, and, variable, capacitor, sections, as, gangs, for, convenience,, or, call, varactors, "the, electronic, equivalent", of, gangs., Variable, capacitors, are, superior, in, a, number, of, respects:, they, are, essentially, perfectly, reliable, as, passive, components,, as, opposed, to, active, diodes, which, can, be, damaged, electrically;, and, they, maintain, their, characteristics, across, the, FM, band,, as, a, function, of, signal, level,, and, have, a, much, higher, Q, (essentially, the, ability, to, reject, unwanted, frequencies, in, favor, of, a, desired, frequency)., Variable, capacitors, create, some, measure, of, front-end, selectivity, where, it, has, no, negative, effects, on, the, signal,, as, opposed, to, selectivity, in, the, IF, which, can, have, a, profound, impact, on, the, signal., The, number, of, gangs, and, the, overall, front-end, architecture, of, a, tuner, directly, correlates, with, its, ability, to, reject, spurious, signals, and, images,, and, usually, indicates, the, tuner's, ability, to, handle, strong, signals, from, local, transmitters, without, overloading, the, front, end., Our, contributor, Brian, L., explains, why:, "Each, tuned, stage, is, tuned, to, a, particular, frequency, and, amplifies, that, frequency, only, (actually,, a, range, of, frequencies, near, the, desired, frequency)., The, RF, amps, are, tuned, by, the, gangs, of, the, tuning, capacitor,, one, gang, per, tuned, circuit., One, gang, is, left, over, to, tune, the, local, oscillator, (LO)., Therefore,, a, 3-gang, tuner, has, only, two, tuned, circuits, to, select, the, desired, station, and, reject, the, rest., A, 5-gang, tuner, has, four, tuned, circuits, to, select, only, the, desired, station's, signal, and, this, leads, to, better, attenuation, of, the, undesired, signals,, i.e.,, better, image, rejection, and, better, overload, protection, from, other, stations, removed, from, the, desired, station.", Many, other, factors,, including,, but, not, limited, to,, mixer, design, and, RF, amplifier, topology,, also, influence, RF, performance., How, the, gangs, are, arranged, and, what, they, are, used, for, is, also, critical., For, example,, a, 7-gang, tuning, capacitor, can, be, arranged, as, one, section, prior, to, the, first, RF, amp,, two, sections, prior, to, the, second, RF, amp,, two, sections, prior, to, the, mixer, and, two, sections, tuning, the, local, oscillator, and, a, buffer, (1/2/2/2),, or, it, can, be, arranged, as, (2/2/2/1)., Different, front-end, architectures, can, be, expected, to, yield, different, performance, from, the, same, number, of, gangs., However,, we, have, found, that, the, number, of, gangs, can, be, a, convenient, "shorthand", indication, of, the, overall, build, quality, of, a, tuner,, affecting, sensitivity,, image, and, spurious, signal, rejection,, maximum, signal-to-noise, ratio,, and, other, front-end, parameters., This, attention, to, detail, and, performance, in, the, RF, front, end, may,, or, may, not,, carry, through, to, the, IF,, detector,, multiplex, and, audio, stages., The, number, of, gangs, used, commercially, in, quality, tuners, has, ranged, from, a, low, of, 3, to, a, high, of, 9., Each, tuning, element, inserts, loss, that, must, be, compensated, for, by, RF, amplification, or, the, gain, of, the, antenna., Some, tuners, have, different, operating, modes, or, bypasses, that, reconfigure, or, bypass, gangs., We, have, found, that, tuners, need, a, minimum, of, 5, gangs, to, perform, optimally, over, a, wide, variety, of, reception, conditions,, but, some, 4-gang, tuners, will, provide, excellent, performance, in, most, situations., Even, some, 3-gang, tuners, are, quite, sensitive,, but, may, have, problems, with, strong, signals, showing, up, in, many, places, across, the, dial, due, to, front-end, overload., Our, contributor, Eric, B., posted, a, nice, (mostly, correct), writeup, on, counting, gangs, in, our, FMtuners, group., Here, are, some, photos, showing, two, of, the, possible, configurations, of, 4, FM, gangs, and, 2, AM, gangs, in, the, tuning, capacitors, of, the, (analog), Sansui, TU-717, and, TU-719,, and, the, varactor, (digital), equivalent, of, 6, FM, gangs, in, the, Sumo, Charlie., Filters:, All, tuners, use, IF, (intermediate, frequency), bandpass, filters, nominally, at, 10.7, MHz., From, the, 1970s, on,, multiple, 2-stage, ceramic, filters, have, been, used, to, attempt, to, eliminate, alternate, channel, interference, and, minimize, adjacent, channel, interference., "Filter, mods", are, modifications, that, involve, (among, other, things), replacing, the, tuner's, original, ceramic, filters, with, narrower, bandwidth, filters, to, improve, selectivity,, and, some, information, on, this, site, is, intended, to, assist, and, encourage, those, who, wish, to, do, so., In, our, reviews,, we, usually, include, the, number, of, ceramic, filters, for, which, the, tuner, has, slots, in, its, circuit, board,, when, known., A, tuner, with, 3, or, more, filters, can, almost, always, be, made, more, selective, with, a, filter, mod,, and, the, most, selective, tuners, use, 4,, 5, or, even, more, filters., See, Bob's, Filter, Corner, for, more, information, on, filters, and, filter, mods,, with, links, to, other, good, info,, and, see, below, for, info, on, Bill, Ammons', Filter, Adder, PCB., Would-be, filter, modders, are, cautioned, that, while, replacing, a, tuner's, stock, filters, with, new, narrower, ones, will, certainly, improve, selectivity,, if, the, new, filters, have, not, been, professionally, measured, and, matched,, there, is, likely, to, be, a, noticeable, degradation, of, audio, quality., Particularly, when, changing, filters, in, a, digitally, tuned, receiver,, one, should, ensure, that, the, new, narrow, filters, are, centered, right, on, 10.7, MHz,, because, the, filters, purchased, could, easily, be, centered, anywhere, from, 10.67, to, 10.73, MHz., Alignments, An, alignment, can, improve, a, tuner's, weak-signal, reception,, distortion,, and, stereo, separation., Also,, in, many, cases, the, tuning, dial, reads, incorrectly,, and, an, alignment, solves, that, problem, (although, it, should, be, pointed, out, that, a, well-calibrated, tuning, dial, does, not, necessarily, indicate, that, the, tuner, is, properly, aligned)., Setting, the, tuner's, detector, correctly, can, also, improve, reception, of, adjacent-channel, stations., If, one, listens, primarily, to, strong, local, stations,, it, may, not, be, apparent, that, a, tuner, is, out, of, alignment,, and, a, misaligned, tuner, can, have, sensitivity, as, high, (poor), as, 10-15, uV, and, still, sound, fine, on, locals., With, a, good, alignment,, the, sensitivity, of, many, top, tuners, can, be, improved, to, 1.5, uV, or, even, lower., To, do, a, decent, tuner, alignment,, one, needs, a, low-distortion, FM, generator, made, exclusively, for, FM, tuner, work,, like, a, Sound, Technology, ST-1000A;, a, good, AC/DC, multimeter;, a, 100, MHz, oscilloscope, with, X-Y, capability;, a, 125, MHz, counter;, a, very, good, distortion, meter;, and, a, very, low-distortion, audio, signal, source., Then, a, bunch, of, BNC, cables,, test, leads,, probes,, etc., In, some, cases,, you, may, have, to, build, adapters, or, probes, from, scratch, or, otherwise, improvise., Procuring, the, equipment, is, one, thing,, and, figuring, out, how, to, use, it, successfully, is, another., Many, people, could, do, it, with, proper, training, and, help,, but, it, is, best, learned, by, observing, in, person,, like, learning, a, trade,, rather, than, by, reading, how, to, do, it., Usually, the, manual, for, the, stereo, generator, is, a, good, starting, point., Our, panelist, Bob, discusses, alignment, techniques, in, our, FMtuners, group, in, the, series, of, posts, beginning, here,, and, here, is, a, useful, discussion, of, alignments, of, Scott, tuners,, most, of, which, have, broader, application., A, current, source, of, high-quality, FM, Stereo, alignment, generators, is, Levear, (formerly, called, Panasonic)., These, are, sold, and, supported, by, Howard, Anderson, at, WHA, Electronics,, reachable, at, whaelecATinsightbb.com, (replace, the, AT, with, an, @, sign)., When, selecting, a, shop, for, tuner, modifications,, repairs,, or, even, just, a, tuneup,, ask, what, kind, of, test, gear, they, use, to, complete, the, final, RF, checkout, and, alignment., We, believe, it, is, critical, that, RF, mods,, repairs,, and, alignments, be, fully, measured, to, ensure, that, the, tuner, meets, or, exceeds, factory, specs, as, set, forth, in, the, service, manual., This, critical,

make, it, easier, for, TIC, readers, to, locate, tuners, on, eBay,, there, are, little, "Search, eBay", links, next, to, most, TIC, tuner, listings., But, please, note, that, eBay, listings, with, misspellings, or, misplaced, hyphens, may, not, show, up, in, the, search,, so, if, you're, desperate, to, find, a, particular, tuner, you, might, want, to, do, a, search, for, all, tuners, by, that, manufacturer., Please, note, that, some, eBay, sellers, are, not, willing, to, stand, behind, what, they, sell,, reciting, the, mantra, "sold, as, is,, as, always, with, used, electronic, equipment.", They're, full, of, it!, It's, not, "always", and, it, doesn't, have, to, be, that, way., Prices, listed, on, this, site, are, for, tuners, sold, by, reputable, sellers, who, guarantee, that, they'll, work., "As, is", sale, prices, are, often, much, lower., If, you're, tempted, by, an, "as, is", listing,, ask, the, seller, specifically, what, problems, the, tuner, has,, and, if, you're, not, comfortable, with, the, response,, don't, bid., If, all, the, readers, of, this, site, try, to, avoid, "as, is", auctions, (they're, justifiable, in, some, cases),, we, may, even, help, reduce, the, number, of, shady, sellers, selling, damaged, items, "as, is", on, eBay., Here, is, an, eBay, "Rogues', Gallery", to, warn, electronics, buyers, about, nasty,, fraudulent, or, maybe, just, deceptive, sellers., If, you've, been, abused, or, scammed,, please, email, us, with, the, details., And, now,, one, of, the, sleaziest,, most, dishonest, things, we've, ever, seen., An, eBay, seller, from, Elmont,, New, York, called, "rego_rego", had, a, listing, with, the, following, line:, "This, is, a, beautiful, Accuphase, T-110CS, DIGITAL, TUNER., I'm, not, familiar, with, digital, tuners, so, please, do, your, research, before, buying., It, has, a, nice, DAC, too, if, you, don't, use, it, as, a, tuner.", The, T-110CS, was, a, CS-PCM, tuner, for, satellite, broadcasting, --, a, method, of, transmission, that, was, available, only, in, Japan, and, only, for, a, couple, of, years, in, the, mid-1990s., And, the, DAC, has, no, typical, digital, input,, only, digital, outputs,, making, this, tuner, nothing, more, than, a, very, pricey, doorstop, for, which, our, hero, hoped, to, get, $800., Our, contributor, doug, s., reports,, "I, had, some, emails, with, this, guy., He's, a, real, a$$;, is, not, at, all, interested, in, being, upfront, with, the, eBay, buying, community., He, admitted, to, me, that, I, might, be, right,, 'maybe, it's, not, a, tuner.', He's, definitely, wanting, to, scam, someone., He, even, bragged, that, he, has, already, sold, one, for, $1,000.", Hey, rego:, Welcome, to, TIC,, scumbag., Here's, another, lowlife,, a, guy, with, 100%, feedback, on, eBay, who, doesn't, mind, flagrantly, lying:, eBay, user, "phastpay", wrote,, "The, website, 'FM, Tuner, Info', states,, 'The, L0-7T, tuner, is, the, most, sensitive, and, selective, tuner, yet, reviewed'., This, great, ability, of, the, Kenwood, L-07T, tuner, to, pick, up, stations, is, due, to, its, 7, gang, tuning, capacitor, (The, most, gangs, ever, used, in, a, tuner!).", Of, course,, we, never, said, anything, of, the, kind,, and, there, were, a, number, of, 8,, 9, and, even, 10-gang, tuners., He, also, said,, "The, L0-7T, tuners, are, EXTREMELY, rare, and, not, found, in, the, US., I, waited, four, years, and, could, not, find, one, on, E-Bay", -, also, nonsense., L-07Ts, do, pop, up, a, few, times, a, year, on, eBay., He, also, sold, an, L-07TII, and, said,, "This, tuner, has, the, best, selectivity, and, Sensitivity, of, any, tuner, as, tested, by, the, web, site, 'fmtunerinfo.com'", --, another, outright, lie., We, suggest, you, avoid, any, future, auction, by, this, bottom-dweller., Sleazy, ebay, seller, "bigappleaudio_2", intentionally, posted, fuzzy, photos, of, his, Sansui, TU-X1, and, wrote, "All, the, pictures, are, part, of, my, description", to, deceive, potential, bidders, into, assuming, that, this, tuner, covered, the, U.S., and, European, FM, band,, when, a, very, close, look, at, the, photos, revealed, that, it, actually, tuned, the, Japanese, 76-90, MHz, FM, band., When, numerous, members, of, our, FMtuners, group, emailed, him, and, we, put, up, a, warning, here, on, TIC,, he, changed, his, auction, listing, to, claim, that, we, were, trying, to, hold, down, the, sale, price, for, ourselves!, Not, quite,, moron., Here's, a, cautionary, tale, for, any, eBay, seller, who, thinks, he, can, avoid, problems, with, overseas, scammers, by, only, shipping, to, U.S., addresses., One, of, our, panelists, sold, an, expensive, piece, of, jewelry, to, a, buyer, in, Torrance,, California, named, Vladimir, Khrikulov,, eBay, user, name, "iloveukvv.", 121, positive, feedbacks, in, the, prior, month,, 599, in, the, prior, six, months, and, 927, in, the, prior, year, at, that, time, (even, more, now),, so, we, thought, he, was, a, legit, buyer, even, though, he, had, made, his, feedback, private., He, paid,, and, the, necklace, was, shipped, and, delivered, to, California,, so, we're, finished,, right?, Not, so, fast., One, month, later,, our, seller, received, a, semi-literate, email, through, the, eBay, mail, system, from, the, buyer,, now, claiming, to, be, in, Russia,, complaining, that, the, necklace, was, a, "cheap, Turkish, fake.", The, necklace, had, been, purchased, for, $1,036, from, a, very, fine, jewelry, store, in, New, York, and, was, not, a, fake,, Turkish, or, otherwise., Our, scammer, declined, to, ship, the, necklace, back, but, generously, agreed, to, keep, it, if, he, got, a, refund, of, $250, of, the, original, $350, purchase, price., (Such, a, deal!), Then, he, initiated, a, PayPal, dispute, claiming, that, he, never, received, the, item,, but, when, the, seller, responded, the, scammer, changed, his, claim, to, "item, not, as, described.", After, a, month-long, fight,, PayPal's, executive, staff, eventually, believed, our, seller., Three, morals, to, this, story:, 1., Don't, sell, to, an, eBay, buyer, with, private, feedback., If, the, buyer, waits, to, initiate, an, "item, not, as, described", PayPal, refund, claim, until, after, the, seller, has, received, payment, and, left, positive, feedback,, any, negative, follow-up, comments, posted, after, the, original, feedback, will, not, be, visible., 2., On, eBay,, buyers, cannot, receive, negative, feedback, at, all,, so, scams, like, this, one, are, difficult, to, stop., 3., If, you, want, to, sell, to, overseas, residents,, be, careful., Take, good, photos, of, your, item, and, have, available, the, original, purchase, receipt, or, some, other, evidence, that, the, item, is, authentic., eBay, seller, "fareed110", has, 100%, feedback,, but, that, obviously, doesn't, mean, much, because, this, guy/gal, is, quickly, developing, a, reputation, for, ridiculous,, exaggerated, and, just, plain, lying, auction, listings., His, listing, for, a, low-end, JVC, T-X6, tuner, called, it, "legendary, &, magnificent,", "superb,, highly, collectible,", and, "absolute, top-of-the-line,, audiophile.", Wrong, on, all, counts!, This, low-end, digital, tuner, wasn't, actually, top, of, ANYTHING,, and, $269.99, plus, $120.00, for, shipping, is, about, $375, too, high., "This, tuner, is, one, of, the, very, best, JVC, tuners, ever, made, and, one, of, the, very, best, made, by, any, brand, in, the, golden, vintage, audio, era!!", Oh,, really?, Welcome, to, the, Rogues', Gallery,, Sluggo., EDIT:, Fareed110, is, trying, the, same, game, plan, with, an, Akai, AT-V04,, which, at, least, is, a, decent, tuner,, but, definitely, not, at, a, starting, point, of, $224.99., He's, asking, least, $150, too, much, on, this, one,, but, -, guess, what?, It, is, also, "one, of, the, very, best, tuners, made, by, any, brand, in, the, golden, vintage, audio, era, at, this, price, range!!", And, it, looks, like, after, fareed110, couldn't, sell, his, T-X6,, he, decided, to, list, it, again, under, the, name, "rexdino55.", With, a, starting, bid, of, $78, he's, only, about, $60, too, optimistic, this, time,, but, he, uses, the, same, ridiculous, language, as, in, his, prior, listing., This, idiot, even, points, out, that, the, tuner, is, "from, the, JVC/Victor, section, of, my, collection.", Sheesh., Several, TIC, readers, had, unpleasant, experiences, dealing, with, a, guy, named, Henry, Jean-Louis, of, Valley, Stream,, New, York,, who, used, to, pad, his, feedback, by, buying, books, for, a, penny, and, then, tried, to, sell, things, like, multi-thousand, dollar, Accuphase, equipment., He, used, to, go, by, the, names, "mcsolaar2002,", "accuphasedealer,", "nmt_student,", "lynda_boutique", and, "pure_audio_master", on, eBay, and, used, the, names, "Takanatokumoto", on, Audiogon., On, eBay,, he, made, his, feedback, and, bidders', identities, private,, which, prevents, good, Samaritans, from, emailing, the, bidders, to, warn, them., You, can, read, about, Henry, in, our, FMtuners, group, in, a, series, of, posts, that, begins, here,, or, in, the, Yahoo, Classic, Sansui, group, in, a, thread, that, begins, here., Our, thanks, to, Beatlefred, and, everyone, else, who, helps, us, keep, track, of, Henry's, activities., An, eBay, seller, from, Ontario, called, "vintage_audio_2000", appears, to, be, just, a, new, name, for, the, guy, who, used, to, call, himself, "vlad20001.", Vlad, was, not, in, Henry's, league,, but, do, a, Google, search, for, "vlad20001", and, you'll, see, why, he, should, be, avoided., Our, contributor, Chris, bought, a, tuner, from, him, and, reports:, "Vlad, waited, for, a, week, after, receiving, my, payment, before, shipping., There, was, a, 'hidden', handling, fee,, and, he, ignored, two, e-mails, regarding, info, on, shipping, dates., The, unit, was, adequately,, but, not, well, packed., In, other, words,, he, makes, the, minimal, effort, on, his, schedule.", And, then, the, tuner, arrived, with, a, mechanical, problem,, but, it's, not, certain, that, Vlad, was, aware, of, it., Another, eBay, seller, named, "trabuegentryauctions", sold, cheap, Allen, wrenches, for, $9.99, apiece, by, calling, them, "Sansui, Tuner, [or, Amplifier], Tuning, Tools.", He, ran, out, of, suckers, and, stopped, doing, this,, but, we'd, continue, to, avoid, his, other, auctions,, too,, on, principle., By, popular, demand, in, our, FMtuners, group,, an, eBay, seller, called, "qualityhifi", was, elected, to, the, Rogues', Gallery, despite, his, 100%, feedback, rating., This, clown, listed, a, Kenwood, KT-413, tuner,, which, usually, sells, for, $10-20,, for, the, bargain, price, of, $650,, implying, that, it, has, been, transformed, because, he, laid, his, hands, on, it:, "THIS, IS, A, REFERANCE, [sic], TUNER!, The, KENWOOD, KT-413, was, a, $250.00, offer, in, 1979., Now, 28, years, later, it, not, only, outperforms, the, level, it, was, when, it, was, new, but, it, will, SOUND, better, and, bring, in, MORE, stations, than, most, all, NEW, tuners!!, I, have, fine, aligned, this, set, to, a, 4uv, FM, Stereo, Sensitivity, level, that, only, a, very, few, tuners, can, compare, to, (and, I, have, probably, reworked, those!)...., The, AM, section, also, has, been, improved., I, have, other, very, fine, tuners, at, far, less, money, than, this, one,, but, due, to, the, uniqueness, of, features, and, performance, this, one, will, be, priced, at, this, level.", Of, course,, no, one, was, dumb, enough, to, buy, this, tuner., Welcome, to, TIC,, slimeball., One, of, the, sleaziest, things, we've, seen, on, eBay, was, pulled, off, by, a, seller, in, Las, Vegas, called, "glo-works.", (Apparently,, even, an, eBay, "PowerSeller", designation, doesn't, mean, the, seller, isn't, scum.), In, his, listing, for, a, Tandberg, 3001,, this, guy, copied, TIC's, entire, writeup, on, the, 3001A, without, attribution,, except, for, the, part, at, the, end, where, we, gave, typical, eBay, prices, (which, are, much, lower, for, the, 3001, than, for, the, more, recent, 3001A)., But, he, didn't, stop, there:, We, wrote, that, the, all-time, high, sale, price, for, the, 3001A, was, "a, stunning, $1,434, in, 2/04, for, a, mint, one,", but, this, scummy, seller, changed, it, to, $2,434, and, increased, the, other, numbers, as, well., When, confronted,, he, replied,, "Like, I, give, a, s--t?!?!, ...But, don't, worry....I'll, return, the, favor!", Glo-works, usually, sells, crappy, trinkets, and, we, believe, is, not, someone, to, be, trusted., EDIT, 12/9/05:, Glo-works, just, placed, a, fraudulent, "Buy-it-Now", bid, on, eBay, just, so, he, could, give, us, negative, feedback,, then, DJSpeclK@aol.com, sent, us, a, profane, email., Stay, far,, far, away, from, this, creep., EDIT, 12/15/05:, We, just, received, the, following, email, from, another, eBay, member:, "i, just, had, to, comment, about, your, comment/website, posting, about, glo-works., he, should, be, taken, OFF, e-bay,, i, contacted, e-bay, regarding, retaliatory, feedback, he, gave, me, (i, gave, him, a, neutral,, i, got, a, nasty, negative)., they, weren't, really, interested, in, doing, anything., unfortunately, i, think, we, are, out, in, the, cyberwilderness, with, this, character.", EBay, does, seem, to, be, inappropriately, protective, of, "PowerSellers":, after, a, brief, suspension, for, what, he, did, to, us,, he's, back, and, undoubtedly, ready, to, berate, more, hapless, buyers., (The, feedback, he, has, left, for, others, resembles, Vlad, with, a, serious, anger, management, problem.), Another, surprise, sleazebag, is, Patrick, Kondreck,, a/k/a, "spiritman68",, according, to, our, trusted, contributor, doug, s.:, "even, tho, spiritman68, has, good, feedback, in, over, 1600, transactions,, that, doesn't, mean, you, should, buy, anything, from, him., i, paid, ~$30, for, a, sherwood, s3300, tuna,, which, he, charged, me, $22, to, ship, (which, is, double, the, actual, shipping, cost)., there, was, absolutely, ZERO, insulation, between, the, tuna, &, the, box, bottom, -, i, have, pic, where, you, can, see, the, holes, gouged, into, the, cardboard,, from, the, screws, on, the, bottom, of, the, foot-less, tuna., this, lack, of, insulation, caused, the, tuning, knob, support, to, break,, rendering, the, tuna, virtually, useless., the, seller, agreed,, after, much, cajoling,, to, completely, refund, my, money,, return, shipping, costs, included,, due, to, such, poor, packaging., well,, i, returned, the, tuna,, &, the, seller, has, refused, to, send, back, even, one, penny., so,, he, now, has, my, money,, insurance, he, collected, from, fedex, (why, they, paid, is, beyond, me),, and, the, damaged, tuna., and,, of, course,, i, have, retaliatory, negative, feedback, on, ebay, from, him.", Another, nasty, deed, on, a, much, smaller, scale,, perpetrated, by, a, guy, called, "mistrwidget,", is, further, confirmation, that, even, a, 100%, feedback, eBay, seller, can, be, a, liar., This, jerk, selectively, copied, from, TIC's, writeup, of, the, bargain-basement, Realistic, TM-1000, (bad, enough), and, also, increased, the, dollar, amounts, of, both, the, typical, sales, price, range, and, the, high, price,, all, in, a, manner, clearly, intended, to, deceive., The, tuner, had, one, bidder, and, sold, for, $27.50,, so, no, one, was, fooled., Mistrwidget, mostly, sells, little, "vintage", crap,, but, if, he, ever, tries, to, sell, a, tuner, again, we, hope, he'll, get, the, level, of, interest, and, trust, he, deserves., An, eBay, seller, called, "rolltide98", isn't, a, scammer, like, the, guys, above,, but, his, eBay, listing, for, a, Luxman, T-115, was, so, filled, with, blatant, nonsense, that, we, wouldn't, trust, anything, he, says,, so, we'd, avoid, his, tuner, auctions., He, said, that, the, T-115, "has, won, some, industry, sound, quality, awards", (we'd, like, to, see, him, name, just, one, of, these, supposed, awards),, has, sold, on, eBay, for, $200-350, "depending, on, the, exact, model, number, and, condition", (excuse, us,, sir,, but, the, T-117,, T-110, and, other, Luxman, tuners, that, may, sell, in, that, price, range, are, totally, different, tuners, from, the, T-115,, which, always, sells, for, much, less),, and, -, best, of, all, -, "it's, a, bargain, here, on, eBay, compared, to, ordering, one, brand, new", (and, how,, exactly,, would, someone, order, a, 1981-model, tuner, brand, new, in, 2004?)., Another, BS, artist, (but, not, a, scammer), is, eBay, seller, "jeffreywrightbooks,", who, wanted, to, sell, a, Vector, Research, VU-1200, tuner, (list, price, of, $109.95, in, 1984)., This, tuner, has, a, grand, total, of, four, buttons, (power, on-off,, AM,, FM, and, muting),, and, absolutely, no, high-end, features,, but, the, eBay, auction, listing, included, a, ton, of, hilarious, audiophile-babble., Some, examples:, "This, low, profile, unit, tested, well, with, my, reference, system,, particularly, in, the, pronunciation, of, horns, and, cymbals, in, the, high, end, and, midrange,, with, plenty, of, throat, in, the, low, mids...., I, ran, this, unit, for, two, straight, days, to, capture, drift, information,, spatial, field,, and, to, search, for, anomalies, and, particular, quirks, that, occur, in, tuners, (you, might, remember, that, certain, early, production, Hafler, and, some, Kenwood, and, Sansui, tuners, are, plagued, with, memory,, drift,, and, synchronization, problems)., [What, the, heck, is, this, guy, talking, about?, -, Editor], I, lifted, the, cover,, lubricated, the, tuning, gang, bearings, and, bushings, for, quietness,, and, touched, up, the, weighted, dial, knob, to, ensure, smooth, bandwidth, travel.", OK,, fine,, he, doesn't, know, what, "bandwidth", means,, but, who, knows, what, he, squirted, in, there, to, gum, things, up., Well, Jeff,, your, ridiculous, writeup, deceived, a, couple, of, people, so, you, managed, to, unload, your, cheapie, tuner, for, $66.50,, about, $50, more, than, it's, worth,, but, now, you're, in, the, Rogues', Gallery., Was, it, worth, it?, Another, purveyor, of, misinformation, on, eBay, is, "classical88,", who, went, into, lots, of, detail, about, how, the, MCS, 3700, was, a, "relabeled", Technics, tuner, (it's, not)., He, then, added,, "Unlike, most, low, cost, digital, tuners,, stations, can, be, precisely, tuned, in, due, to, Technics, Gyro, Touch, Tuning", (even, if, this, were, a, Technics, tuner,, is, it, really, hard, to, tune, in, stations, with, digital, tuners?), and, finally, claimed, that, this, low-cost, department-store, brand, tuner, was, or, is, "used, by, many, telephone, system, installers, for, background, music, on, hold, feature.", Huh?, A, Canadian, eBay, seller, called, "roytagger", is, a, world-class, BS, artist,, if, his, auction, for, an, Akai, PS-200T, digital, tuner, is, any, indication., His, statement, that, this, unknown, tuner, "won, many, prizes, as, best, in, the, world!", is, so, ridiculous, that, it, can, only, be, an, outright, lie., He, also, claims,, "If, you, live, in, remote, areas, or, downtown, where, radio, signals, are, hard, to, pick, up,, this, is, the, best, choice, on, the, market", -, remarkable, for, a, tuner, that, none, of, our, panelists, had, ever, heard, of., Akai, did, make, some, sleepers, and, we, don't, have, a, basis, for, saying, that, this, one, is, not, a, good, tuner,, but, to, say, that, multiple, sources, recognized, it, as, "the, best", is, just, silly., Finally,, a, friend, of, TIC, says, he, attempted, to, buy, a, McIntosh, MR, 77, for, $400, from, a, guy, named, Christian, Schmidgall, of, Pompano, Beach,, Florida,, and, sent, him, a, money, order,, but, they, couldn't, agree, on, the, shipping, cost, and, the, creep, didn't, send, the, tuner, or, return, the, money., Schmidgall, used, to, go, by, "Catman777", on, eBay, but, he, changed, his, user, name, after, we, exposed, him,, so, be, careful, dealing, with, ANY, eBay, seller, from, Pompano, Beach., Contact, Us,
