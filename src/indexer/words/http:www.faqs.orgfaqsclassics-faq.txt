capital, C), or, the, adjective, "classical", refer, to, the, discipline, described, below,, rather, than, to, good, books, from, any, period., The, discipline, of, Classics, is, the, study, of, Greek, and, Roman, civilization,, from, Homer, to, Constantine,, but, including, study, of, the, direct, antecedents, of, Greece, and, Rome, in, the, prehistoric, period, of, southern, Europe, and, their, descendants, in, the, Middle, Ages., This, encompasses, both, the, Greek, and, Latin, languages, and, their, literature,, including, poetry,, drama,, history,, philosophy,, rhetoric,, religion, and, political, theory,, as, well, as, art,, architecture,, and, archaeology., Further,, discussion, of, the, relevant, cultural, milieus, brings, in, Persia,, the, Middle, East,, Egypt,, and, early, Europe., Precise, chronological, boundaries, are, difficult, to, establish,, but, the, most, common, feature, is, the, relevance, of, the, period, or, material, to, Greek, and/or, Latin, texts., An, increasing, number, of, classicists, are, devoting, their, energies, to, later, Latin, texts,, including, neo-Latin, (relatively, modern), original, works,, and, to, prehistory, or, linguistics,, especially, in, archaeology., Discussions, of, the, prehistory, of, the, Greek, and, Latin, languages, are, encouraged,, as, well., This, requires, that, some, discussion, of, related, languages, such, as, Sanskrit, and, Hittite, be, allowed., When, taught, with, an, emphasis, on, Greek, and, Latin,, this, is, often, called, Classical, Linguistics., Note, on, Dates:, All, dates, in, this, FAQ, are, given, using, BCE, and, CE, rather, than, BC, and, AD., Michael, Covington, notes:, Some, people, take, the, use, of, BCE, and, CE, in, place, of, BC, and, AD, as, an, anti-Christian, gambit., I, don't, take, it, that, way;, Jesus, wasn't, born, in, exactly, 1, A.D.,, and, saying, BCE, and, CE, makes, it, clear, we, are, using, the, conventional, year-numbering, rather, than, counting, years, from, the, actual, birth, of, Christ., ----------------------------------------, 1, Questions, And, Answers, Commonly, asked, questions, appear, here:, ----------------------------------------, 1.1, How, should, I, pronounce..., 1.1.1, Ancient, Greek?, Technical, Answer:, Ancient, Greek, had, dialects, and, regional, inflections,, so, asking, how, it, was, pronounced, is, like, asking, how, English, is, pronounced, today., The, original, inhabitants, of, Greece, were, not, Greek-speakers,, but, spoke, a, lost, non-Indo-, European, language, (traces, remain, in, some, place-names)., People, who, spoke, what, we, call, the, Greek, language, migrated, into, the, Balkan, peninsula, during, the, Aegean, bronze, age,, ~2200BCE., From, about, 1200BCE, to, 850, BCE,, there, were, several, migrations, of, Dorians,, themselves, Greek, speakers,, into, the, Peloponese,, following, the, demise, of, the, Mycenaean, realm., There, were, at, least, five, main, dialects, of, Greek, spoken, during, this, time:, Ionic,, Aeolic,, Arcadian,, Doric,, and, North-West, Greek., Prior, to, the, demise, of, Mycenae,, there, seems, to, have, been, a, North/South, split, in, Greek, dialects,, with, Arcado-Cypriot, and, Attic-Ionic, descending, from, South, Greek,, and, Doric, and, Aeolic, from, North, Greek., This, accords, better, with, the, early, inscriptions, than, the, East/West, division, usually, noted, in, older, textbooks, on, the, basis, of, post-Mycenaean, data, only., Since, the, 19th, Century,, much, of, the, pronunciation, of, the, Attic, dialect, has, been, well, described,, based, on, rigorous, principles, applied, to, close, readings, of, the, descriptions, of, ancient, grammarians., The, pronunciation, of, the, consonants, has, been, accepted, for, more, than, a, century;, the, vowels, have, been, well-known, for, more, than, 50, years;, and, with, the, advances, of, modern, linguistics, in, such, areas, as, accentology, we, now, have, a, very, good, idea, of, how, the, accent, system, worked., Practical, Answer:, It, depends, on, who, you, ask., Most, Europeans, and, Americans, use, what's, called, the, "Erasmian", pronunciation,, which, is, nothing, like, modern, Greek., Native, speakers, of, Modern, Greek, use, the, Modern, Greek, pronunciation., Others, use, less, common, systems., We, will, describe, two, pronunciations,, the, Erasmian, (traditional, in, most, European, and, American, schools), and, the, linguistic., We, will, assume, an, educated, southern, American, accent, in, our, examples,, as, well, as, using, the, ASCII, version, of, the, International, Phonetic, Alphabet, (as, devised, by, Evan, Kirshenbaum,, and, available, at, http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Evan_Kirshenbaum/IPA/)., Letter, Erasmian,

gamma+kappa/gamma/ksi/khi, is, Nk/Ng/Nks/Nkh:, sinker,, finger,, sinks,, sinking, (Also, possibly, in, gamma+mu:, Nm)., Accents:, In, the, Erasmian, system,, all, three, accents, (oxeia/acute,, bareia/grave,, and, perispomenon/circumflex), are, treated, as, simple, stress, accents., However,, as, we, know, from, the, ancient, grammarians,, these, represented, different, *pitches*,, similar, to, though, not, identical, with, the, accent, system, in, certain, Japanese, dialects., If, you, wish, to, use, a, pitch, accent, in, your, Greek, reading,, the, following, system, works, well:, 1., The, acute, is, a, rise, of, a, musical, fifth, from, the, base, level, of, the, voice,, according, to, the, grammarians., This, is, approximately, the, change, in, pitch, in, the, English, inquiring, sentence, "Yes???", 2., The, grave, is, either, a, complete, lack, of, an, expected, accent,, or, a, lowered, rise, (a, musical, third)., A, string, of, these, may, be, pronounced, levelly, on, the, higher, note, of, the, rise., 3., The, circumflex, is, usually, referred, to, as, a, falling, pitch, contour;, the, real, secret, is, that, it, consists, of, a, rise, of, a, third, followed, by, a, fall, to, ground, in, the, course, of, a, single, long, vowel, or, a, diphthong., The, explanation, for, this, is, that, long, vowels,, like, diphthongs,, can, be, viewed, as, a, sequence, of, two, short, vowels,, with, the, accent, being, applied, to, the, first., 1.1.2, Latin, A, Summary, of, Classical, Latin, Pronunciation, (from, Vox, Latina), a, short, As, first, a, in, Italian, amare, (as,

For, long, vowels,, mark, length, with, a, colon, ":", following, the, vowel., This, applies, to, both, languages., In, Greek,, the, accents, should, be, represented, by, ', (acute), `, (grave), ~, (circum-, flex), following, the, vowel, in, question., Since, the, circumflex, can, only, fall, on, a, *long*, vowel, or, a, diphthong,, the, colon, marking, vowel, length, can, be, considered, optional, with, the, circumflex., The, Greek, alphabet, should, be, transcribed, as, a, b, g, d, e, z, E:, th, i, k, l, m, n, o, ks, p, r, s, t, u, ph, ps, kh, O:, with, the, additional, long, vowels, a:, i:, u:, e:, o:, (though, the, latter, two, may, be, written,, as, is, traditional,, ei, and, ou)., Latin, may, be, written, using, i, and, u, for, both, the, vowel, and, the, consonant, sounds,, or, the, doublets, i/j, and, u/v, respectively., Many, people, prefer, to, use, i, for, both,, but, u/v, rather, than, just, u, (or, v)., ----------------------------------------, 1.3, What, are, the, best, translations, of, ...?, Good, question, :-), Translations, into, English, of, most, of, the, popular, classical, authors, may, be, found, along, with, great, authors, of, other, periods, in, the, Penguin, Classics, series., Some, of, these,, it, has, been, noted,, are, of, greater, literary, merit, than, others;, that, may, simply, be, the, way, of, translations,, from, whatever, source., The, Oxford, World, Classics, series, also, has, a, large, number, of, good, translations, of, classical, works,, not, entirely, overlapping, the, Penguin, Classics, in, coverage., Many, who, have, studied, Greek, and, Latin, since, the, early, 1900s, have, been, grateful, for, the, existence, of, the, Loeb, series, (red, covers, for, Latin,, green, for, Greek), of, facing-page, translations, of, a, number, of, important,, and, even, better,, of, entirely, unimportant,, authors., These, are, published, jointly, by, Harvard, and, Oxford., ----------------------------------------, 1.4, Who,
