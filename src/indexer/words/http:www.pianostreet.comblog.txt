3rd,, 2017, Category:, Piano, News, 1, comment, Following, the, successful, Eastern, Preludes, collection, by, the, composer, Christopher, Norton,, the, Pacific, Preludes, are, now, set, to, be, released, on, April, 4., Piano, Street’s, Patrick, Jovell, talked, to, Christopher, Norton,, who, gives, us, an, exclusive, glimpse, into, his, compositional, world., He, is, also, generously, offering, Piano, Street, Gold, members, the, score, to, Prelude, no., 7, “Now, is, the, Hour”, as, well, as, an, instructive, manual, for, how, to, practice, the, piece., These, collections, allow, us, to, explore, the, rich, musical, landscape, of, the, East, as, each, Prelude, weaves, together, native, themes, from, countries, in, this, specific, part, of, the, world., The, creator, of, the, Micro, Jazz, series, demonstrates, an, interesting, fusion, of, Eastern, and, Western, culture, and, styles, and, suits, ideally, intermediate, to, advanced-level, pianists., The, fourteen, pieces, are, perfect, for, the, concert, platform,, as, well, as, providing, excellent, teaching, material., An, accompanying, CD, puts, each, Prelude, on, the, map, with, a, fine, demonstration, performances, by, British, pianist, Iain, Farrington., EXCLUSIVE, DOWNLOADS:, Piano, score:, Now, is, the, Hour, by, Christopher, Norton, Practice, manual:, Now, is, the, Hour, by, Christopher, Norton, -, Christopher,, we, all, know, you, as, the, creator, of, the, Microjazz, series, which, is, one, of, the, most, widely, used, educational, series, ever, published, but, your, production, as, a, composer, is, vast, and, diverse., Which, was, your, idea, and, inspiration, when, you, started, creating, Preludes, collections, for, piano?, -, I, wrote, the, original, Microjazz, books, back, in, 1981, –, the, brief, I, was, given, was, “graded, pieces, in, popular, styles”, In, difficulty, terms,, none, of, the, pieces, in, the, original, series, were, easier, than, Grade, 1, or, harder, than, Grade, 5., This, is, one, of, the, reasons, the, series, became, popular, so, quickly,, the, other, reason, being, that, there, was, a, range, of, styles, that, students, found, very, appealing., I, was, originally, quite, a, “serious”, pianist,, playing, repertoire, that, included, the, Barber, Sonata,, the, Prokofiev, 1st, concerto, and, lots, of, classical, repertoire., So, it, came, quite, naturally, to, me, to, write, more, challenging, piano, music, and, a, request, to, write, longer,, more, complex, pieces, in, rock, and, Latin, styles, was,, as, they, say,, pushing, an, open, door., The, Rock, Preludes, and, Latin, Preludes,, both, written, in, the, late, 80s/early, 90s,, are, still, popular, with, students, looking, for, more, challenging, fare, that, is, also, in, a, contemporary, popular, style., -, In, 2015, the, collection, Eastern, Preludes, was, published, and, contains, pieces, which, weaves, together, native, themes, from, countries, including, China,, India,, Japan,, Korea,, and, Thailand, with, characteristically, innovative, popular, music, styles., For, many, a, performer, and, teacher, these, materials, can, work, as, performance, pieces, or, as, an, excellent, introduction, to, works, by, the, Impressionists., I, know, Debussy, is, your, favorite, composer, but, how, do, you, think, as, a, composer, when, combining, modern, modes, with, a, basically, impressionistic, soundscape?, -, I, love, Debussy, because, he, liked, to, set, up, an, atmosphere, using, complex, textures, with, often, quite, simple, melodic, material., Taking, existing, tunes, and, weaving, a, tapestry, of, sound, around, them, is, something, I, particularly, like, to, do., There, are, a, number, of, pieces, in, Pacific, Preludes, where, a, melody, is, passed, between, the, hands, while, other, figuration, happens, above, or, below., The, tunes, I, found, are, in, a, variety, of, modes,, so, there, is, an, interesting, harmonic, palette, in, the, Pacific, Preludes,, with, very, jazzy, passages,, passages, that, are, pure, texture, and, highly, rhythmic, and, exciting, pieces, as, well., -, Talking, about, the, “serious”, Christopher, Norton,, I, just, heard, performances, with, Yuja, Wang, in, Bartóks, 3rd, concerto, and, Peter, Jablonski, in, the, Stravinsky, concerto, and, these, composers’, battle, between, modernity, and, tradition., How, would, you, distinguish, art, music, in, this, context, and, how, does, this, reflect, your, own, composition, work?, -, I, have, spent, most, of, my, working, life, involved, with, educational, music,, in, which, modernity, plays, a, less, significant, role, than, in, some, other, fields!, However,, I, have, discovered, that, if, I, let, my, ear, be, the, guide, I, can, get, away, with, delving, into, slightly, more, esoteric, realms,, including, bi-tonality,, aleatoric, elements, and, free, improvisation., I, have, recently, written, a, Piano, Sonata, and, it, has, a, lot, of, time, signature, changes, and, quick, contrasting, of, highly, varied, stylistic, elements., Other, large-scale, pieces, allow, me, to, be, slightly, more, experimental., At, the, moment, I’m, digitising, the, score, of, a, Piano, Concerto,, written, when, I, was, 23,, which, includes, elements, of, Bartok, and, Stravinsky., -, Now, we, are, eagerly, waiting, for, a, new, collection, of, Preludes,, soon, to, be, released, and, named, Pacific, Preludes., What, can, you, tell, us, about, these, works?, -, The, Pacific, Preludes, use, tunes, culled, from, a, variety, of, countries, that, border, the, Pacific., My, starting, point, was, my, own, origins, –, 2, tunes, from, New, Zealand,, Pokarekare, Ana, and, Now, is, the, Hour., I, then, added, Waltzing, Matilda, from, Australia, and, from, then, on, it, was, a, matter, of, finding, appealing, melodies, from, Central, and, South, America,, from, the, USA, and, Russia, (topical!), and, from, China,, Vietnam, and, the, Philippines., There, is, a, nice, mixture, of, ballads,, extrovert, rhythmic, pieces, and, rockers,, as, well, as, a, ragtime, piece, (Waltzing, Matilda), The, pieces, are, challenging,, but, very, pianistic., -, The, Preludes, in, the, Eastern, collection, as, well, as, in, the, Pacific, collection, was, recorded, by, British, (and, Hyperion, artist), pianist, Iain, Farrington., Has, this, been, a, collaboration, which, has, blended, your, composition, process, or, raised, interpretational, or, textual, questions, or, considerations?, -, Iain, Farringdon, is, a, fabulous, pianist, and, musician, and, he, played, the, pieces, beautifully, from, the, word, go., I, had, one, or, two, suggestions, in, terms, of, articulation, and, some, slightly, unusual, pedal, effects,, but, broadly, speaking, what, you, hear, on, the, recordings, of, both, Eastern, Preludes, and, Pacific, Preludes, have, been,, as, American, politicians, like, to, say,, been, approved, by, the, composer., /nilsjohan, Leave, a,

work, which, until, recently, had, been, attributed, to, Felix, Mendelssohn,, but, is, now, proved, to, be, the, work, of, his, sister, Fanny, Mendelssohn, Hensel., These, days, Fanny, Mendelssohn, is, considered, to, be, as, worthy, of, study, as, Felix,, but, in, her, lifetime, she, was, barred, from, composing, by, her, father,, who, said, a, public, career, was, unsuitable, to, her, sex., “She, was, an, amazing, woman,, who, persevered, despite, complete, discouragement,”, her, great-great-great, granddaughter, Sheila, Hayman, told, BBC, Radio, 4’s, Today, programme., She, explains, to, Mishal, Husain, how,, “despite, complete, discouragement”,, Fanny, overcame, the, attitudes, of, the, time, to, compose, 500, pieces, of, music., “When, she, was, 14,, she, learnt, all, of, Bach’s, 48, preludes, and, fugues, off, by, heart, –, which, is, quite, a, thing, –, and, her, father’s, response, was, to, say,, ‘That’s, all, very, well,, dear, but, you’re, a, girl,, so, you, can’t, be, a, musician…, You’ve, got, to, stay, at, home, and, make, the, lives, of, men, better.’”, When, The, Easter, Sonata, was, discovered,, the, manuscript, was, marked, “F, Mendelssohn,”, and, many, concluded, it, was, by, Felix., American, Mendelssohn, scholar, Dr, Angela, Mace, Christian, proved, otherwise, after, gaining, brief, access, to, the, original,, privately-owned, manuscript, in, 2010., By, comparing, the, handwriting, to, Fanny’s,, analyzing, the, notes, and, alterations,, and, matching, the, page, numbers, to, a, missing, section, in, an, album, of, Fanny’s, music,, she,
