HAPPY, CAMPERS,  , David, Koonce, Fairway, Independent, Mortgage,  , In, the, Summer,, a, client, was, referred, to, me, by, a, Realtor, partner, of, mine,, to, do, a, non-arms, length, transaction, for, a, friend, of, her’s., A, mom, was, selling, her, home, in, Maryland, to, her, daughter., The, Realtor, did, not, want, to, be, involved, in, the, transaction, for, her, friend,, so, I, wanted, to, make, sure, the, hand, off, was, as, easy, and, painless, as, possible, for, her., I, partnered, with, Lawyers, Advantage, who, assisted, by, drawing, up, the, sales, contract, and, preparing, the, closing, documentation., As, the, process, unfolded,, it, became, apparent, that, going, the, extra, mile, -, or, 300,, was, the, only, way, this, deal, was, going, to, happen, as, the, clients, needed., The, family,, mother, and, daughter, included,, own, a, campground, in, upstate, New, York, and, were, busy, all, summer, traveling, back, and, forth, to, it, to, host, events, for, the, campers., Gathering, needed, documents, and, signatures, from, both, parties, to, complete, the, transaction, was, very, difficult,, so, I, created, a, process, and, work, flow, to, accommodate, there, travel, schedule., I, understand, what, it’s, like, to, camp, in, remote, places, and, not, have, a, fax, machine, or, the, internet, at, your, fingertips, since, I’m, from, South, Dakota!, In, this, case,, these, could, only, be, found, at, the, “local”, pharmacy, 30, miles, away., The, saving, grace, of, the, deal, was, the, process, itself, that, was, created, and, the, clear, communication, to, both, parties, as, to, exactly, what, was, needed, and, when, so, as, to, minimize, their, trips, to, the, pharmacy., As, a, result,, the, documents, were, gathered, in, a, timely, fashion,, and,, in, fact,, we, were, ready, to, close, two, weeks, early., The, next, challenge, was, orchestrating, the, signing, of, the, seller’s, closing, documents, at, the, campsite, when, the, nearest, notary, was, 2.5, hours, away., The, buyer, was, to, sign, the, next, day, in, Maryland., All, went, without, a, hitch., The, final, result, was, a, happy, pair, of, campers,, especially, the, daughter, since, she, was, able, to, buy, the, home, with, less, than, $500, out, of, pocket., The, moral, of, the, story, is, that, it, pays, to, take, the, time, to, think, through, the, process, and, structure, of, the, transaction, so, that, all, our, clients, can, become, happy, campers., Needless, to, say,, my, Realtor, partner, was, thrilled, as, well.,  , David, Koonce,  , Our, transactions, are, very, complicated,, and, we, know, that, Lawyers, Advantage, will, prepare, the, necessary, documents, correctly, and, expeditiously., Their, staff, is, welcoming, and, patient, and, they, are, exceptional, at, explaining, the, process, to, our, homebuyers, not, only, during, closing, but, while, teaching, our, Habitat, for, Humanity, pre-purchase, classes., -Dee, Danmeyer,,
