tools, to, help, you, organize, the, internet, Share, with, Buffer, More…, -, SHARES, 74, Comments, Written, by, Leo, Widrich, Apr, 17,, 2012, Last, updated:, Jan, 21,, 2016, 2, minutes, to, read, The, internet, is, a, big, place., For, a, long, time,, I, found, the, task, of, organizing, and, remembering, all, the, articles,, images,, videos,, posts,, tweets,, and, sites, to, be, formidable., The, mass, of, information, only, continues, to, grow,, but, I, have, latched, on, to, 10, free, tools, that, help, me, organize, my, online, journey., 5, are, common,, and, 5, are, just, getting, big, on, the, scene., I, hope, you, can, find, some, that, help, you, as, well., 1.) Evernote, I, have, been, using, Evernote, on, and, off, for, a, couple, years, now,, intensively, since, January., It, is, the, single, most, useful, tool, I’ve, used, for, organizing, and, remembering, online, activity,, notes,, and, ideas., I, use, the, Evernote, web, clipper, to, send, pages, directly, to, my, account,, which, syncs, easily, between, web,, desktop,, and, iPhone., In, fact,, I’m, writing, this, post, on, Evernote!, Coolest, feature? –, Evernote, recognizes, written, text.,  , 2.) Buffer, I’m, a, pretty, new, Buffer, user,, but, so, far, I, love, the, service., It, makes, your, Twitter, usage, much, more, efficient, and, valuable., Buffer, allows, you, to, schedule, your, Tweets, and, Facebook, posts, at, important, times, throughout, the, day., I, don’t, want, to, sit, on, twitter, all, day,, but, I, also, don’t, want, to, only, send, tweets, out, 5, at, a, time, in, the, morning, and, at, night., With, Buffer,, your, problems, are, solved!, Use, the, Chrome, extension, to, grab, web, pages, and, convert, them, to, tweets., Coolest, feature? –, The, main, one,, an, ability, to, schedule, your, social, media, output.,  , 3.) Flipboard, My, brother, turned, me, on, to, Flipboard,, and, it’s, been, my, news, and, information, source, ever, since., It, connects, your, social, media, accounts, and, interests, in, to, a, customized, e-zine, layout., Flipboard, is, easy, to, use,, navigate,, and, share., Star, your, favorite, tweets,, instagram, pics,, and, email, news, sites, to, remember.,  , The, 5, New, Tools, You, Need, To, Know, About,  , 6.) IFTTT, I, joined, a, couple, weeks, ago,, and, this, is, my, new, best, friend, on, the, internet!, IFTT, stands, for, IF, THIS, THEN, THAT,, and, you, can, create, application, tasks, centered, around, answering, IFTT., For, instance,, IF, THIS, (happens), e.g., I, take, an, Instagram, photo,, THEN, THAT, (happens),, e.g., said, photo, is, automatically, saved, to, my, Dropbox, account., I, set, one, up, that, will, automatically, sends, a, thank, you, tweet, when, someone, follows, me.,  , 7.) BlissControl, This, handy, site, allows, you, to, control, all, of, your, social, settings, in, one, place., Change, your, profile, pictures,, bio,, recover, passwords,, and, more., You, can, use, the, service, for, 13, social, media, sites,, including, all, your, favorites, (Facebook,, Twitter,, Google+,, and, Pinterest).,  , 8.) SocialBro, This, provides, incredibly, (almost, overwhelming), statistics, for, your, Twitter, account., From, the, beginning,, Social, Bro, syncs, your, followers, and, provides, up-to-the-minute, stats,, custom, searches,, insights,, and, more., Like, I, said,, it’s, a, ton, of, useful, information,, and, I’m, still, wading, through, it, myself!, Coolest, feature? –, Shows, the, best, times, to, tweet, based, on, your, followers, and sync, that, up, with, Buffer.,  , 9.) Pocket, (formerly, Read, It, Later), This, is, a, wonderful, tool, for, simply, grabbing, an, article, or, web, clip, that, you, want, to, read, later, (see, what, they, did, there?!),, but, don’t, want, to, add, the, entire, site, to, your, RSS, reader., Pocket,, which, has, just, launched, yesterday,, provides, a, clean,, easy, to, read, layout,, and, also, can, link, up, with, your, smartphone., All, your, future, reading, items, in, place,, ready, when, you’re, waiting, at, the, DMV., Coolest, feature? –, Pocket, also, directly, integrates, with Buffer and, lots, of, other, great, sharing, options.,  , 10.) WorkFlowy, If, you, are, the, kind, of, person, that, always, wants, to, be, in, on, the, next, cool, app,, consider, WorkFlowy, for, your, list-making,, note-taking,, project, management,, and, brainstorming., About, the, author:, Matt, Ragland, is, a, writer, who, ranges, on, topics, from, productivity,, social, media, and, outdoor, adventure., He, is, the, assisstant, Director, at, Camp, Rockmont,, and, enjoys, trail, running,, football, and, coffee., Find, out, more, about, him, on, his, blog,, on, Twitter, and, Google+, Share, with, Buffer, More…, -, SHARES, 74, Comments, Looking, for, a, better, way, to, share, on, social, media?, Schedule,, publish, &, analyze, your, posts, across, the, top, social, networks,, all, in, one, place., Get, started, for, free, Written, by, Leo, Widrich, Co-founder, and, COO, at, Buffer., I, enjoy, working, on, company, culture,, customer, development, and, marketing., For, more, personal, posts,, check, out, leostartsup., Dorian, Patterson, For, managing, my, social, media, feeds,, I, use, HootSuite., It, covers, a, large, variety, of, services, and, allows, for, scheduling., It, also, has, analytics, and, team, features,, but, I, don’t, use, those., Workflowy, is, definitely, one, of, my, favorite, apps., Glad, to, see, it, on, the, list., Matt, Ragland, Dorian,, HootSuite, is, great., It’s, definitely, one, of, the, best, all-in-one, social, media, apps., Thanks, for, mentioning, it!, uğur, özer, I, agree, with, you., Robert, Clay, I, also, use, Hootsuite., Excellent, tool,, although, the, scheduling, is, a, bit, primitive, compared, to, Buffer, and, other, tools, I’ve, used., Shawn, M, If, I, may, press, the, post’s, author,, it, appears, to, me, that, Workflowy, and, Evernote, are, very, similar., Matt,, does, one, work, better, for, different, work, or, social, contexts?, I’m, already, using, Evernote, and, like, it, very, much., I’m, intrigued, by, Workflowy,, but, I, would, like, to, hear, more, of, your, perspective, on, it, before, I, commit, to, yet, another, organization, tool., Thanks!, P.S., “Aspiring, blogger”, is, what, you, were, 6, months, ago., After, reviewing, your, blog,, you, seem, rather, well, established, as, a, blogger., Matt, Ragland, Good, question, Shawn., In, my, experience,, Evernote, is, has, so, many, more, features, and, is, a, more, powerful, app., The, integration, between, web,, native,, and, mobile, clients, is, also, a, huge, plus. , The, draw, of, WorkFlowy, to, me,, is, its, simplicity., It, does, a, couple, things,, and, does, it, really, well., Navigation, is, smooth,, search, is, powerful,, and, you, can, communicate, with, other, users., I, think, for, work, teams, that, WF, can, be, useful, because, it’s, easy, to, view, and, build, on, each, other’s, work. , Hope, that, helps!, Robert, Clay, I, use, both,, and, there, is, no, resemblance., Evernote, is, brilliant, for, storing, and, instantly, retrieving, extensive, notes, on, any, manner, of, subjects., Workflowy, is, an, outliner., It, allows, you, to, brainstorm, and, structure, your, thoughts, whether, you, use, it, as, a, planning, tool, or, a, writing, tool., Matt, Ragland, Thanks, for, clarifying, Robert,, you, made, good, points, on, the, differences, between, the, two., Much, appreciated!, Mark, Great, post!, Definitely,

Thank, you., It, would, be, good, to, know, also, the, “negative”, or, “not-so-cool”, features, of, each, of, them,, I, am, sure, they, all, have, their, downs., But, in, any, case,, I, really, appreciate, the, post,, it, has, given, me, fresh, ideas, for, my, own, blog, and, internet, activity., Matt, Ragland, Antonio,, that’s, a, great, point., It’s, important, to, consider, the, fullness, of, an, app, when, you’re, deciding, whether, or, not, to, use, it., Let, me, work, on, some, of, those, for, you!, Heath, Interesting, read., Apparently, I, need, to, move, into, the, 21st, century, a, little, bit, more–great, info!, Matt, Ragland, Heath,, the, important, thing, to, remember, when, jumping, in, to, these, web/social/productivity, apps, is, to, figure, out, what, works, for, you!, I, use, some, of, these, more, than, others,, testing, and, prodding, to, get, the, most, out, of, them., Just, don’t, get, bogged, down!, Thanks, for, reading, the, blog, Ddavis1206, Very, helpful, information.,  Thanks, Matt, Ragland, Glad, you, found, some, tools, that, helped,, appreciate, you, stopping, by!, Walker, Runner, Google, Reader, is, amazing, and, I, use, it, everyday., Looks, like, I, need, to, check, out, pocket, though., Anonymous, I’ve, really, enjoyed, using, Pocket, so, far,, I, think, the, simplicity, of, the, layout, encourages, users, to, simply, read. , Robert, Clay, I, use, 6, out, of, the, 10, constantly,, so, I, agree, with, this, list., I, would, add, two, more., Wunderlist, and, Dropbox,, both, of, which, help, a, great, deal, when, using, multiple, devices., Matt, Ragland, Robert,, thanks, for, adding, to, the, list,, I, really, enjoy, using, Dropbox, as, well,, has, been, a, big, help., I, strongly, considered, putting, it, on, the, list,, but, decided, I, used, it, more, for, personal, file, storage, and, productivity, than, organizing, web, content. , I, haven’t, heard, of, Wunderlist,, will, check, it, out! , Ems56rn, Fantastic, article!, Can’t, wait, to, try, them, all, out., Evernote, is, the, only, one, I’ve, used, and, is, great,, as, you, said., Just, tweeted, this, link!, Thank, you!, Matt, Ragland, Glad, you, found, it,

captured, the, page, better., I, also, used, to, use, the, Read, Later, feature, of, Diigo, for, this, purpose,, but, Diigo, has, pretty, much, been, supplanted, by, other, tools, for, me., Matt, Ragland, Hey, Laura,, thanks, for, reading!, In, Evernote, vs., Pocket,, the, clipping, features, of, each, service, allow, easy, access, to, articles, you, want, to, read, later., However, what, I, enjoy, about, Pocket, is, the, simplicity, of, its, layout,, and, that, it’s, a, single-function, service., Evernote, is, so, powerful, and, does, so, much,, I, often, get, distracted, with, other, tasks., If, I, just, want, to, read, 1, article,, I, go, with, Pocket., Plus,, this, method, doesn’t, clutter, up, my, Evernote, storage, limit. , But,, you, should, go, with, what, works, best, for,
