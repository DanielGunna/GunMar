best, 3-D, stereo, sound, possible., The, instruction, pamphlet, included, with, every, DSM, suggests, positioning, the, two, pickups, forward, of, the, ears, to, about, the, temple, of, a, person, (or, dummy, head), but,, there�s, more, to, the, story., The, position, the, pickups, are, placed,, back, towards, the, ears, or, forward, into, the, temple, area,, makes, a, difference, to, the, perceived, higher, frequencies, on, the, recording.,  ,  ,  ,  , Positioning, DSM�s, closer, to, the, ears, will, give, excellent, 3-D, headphones, reproduction, while, still, retaining, very, good, (much, better, than, in-ear, Binaural), loudspeaker, reproduction,, but...the, perception, of, higher, frequency, detail, is, �softer�, speaker, reproduced, than, perception, encountered, with, headphones, listening., Alternately,, positioning, the, pickups, far, forward, into, the, temple, area, increases, the, perception, of, higher, frequencies, on, loudspeakers, while, still, retaining, excellent, 3-D, headphone, reproduction!,  , Oftentimes, it�s, how, your, ear/brain, actually, perceives, that, makes, all, the, difference., That�s, psycho-acoustics, for, you!, A, better, understanding, of, this, phenomenon, is, simplified, by, realizing, that, DSM, microphones, are, positioned, at, a, place, where, you, record, the, acoustical, impression, in, dimensional, acoustic, space., Conversely,, reproducing, the, recorded, impression, involves, completing, what, you, started, by, doing, a, recording, in, the, first, place,, namely,, completing, the, action, by, reproducing, the, DSM, recorded, sound, exactly, from, same, place, it, was, mic'd!,  ,  ,  , COMMENT:, While, person, head, mounting, or, using, LiteGUY, baffle, is, best, for, consistent, acceptable, stereo, image, quality, (and, a, number, of, other, good, reasons),, some, want, "max, stealth", or, lowest, profile, possible, of, recording, gear, being, worn., Suggest, instead,, having, outfitted, a, special, shirt, or, jacket, with, (button-down?), collars, to, hide, the, pickups, from, view, underneath, the, collar, front, flaps.,  , A, custom, button, hole, located, at, the, inside, rear, of, the, collar, allow, the, pickups, +, cord, threaded, from, inside, to, being, secured, under, the, collar, flaps., Safety, pins,, gaffer's, tape,, and, a, custom, made, cloth, loop, may, be, considered, to, secure, the, pickups.,  This, arrangement, must, be, carefully, tested, to, avoid, rubbing, noises, and, blocking, the, front, view, of, pickups,, but, will, give, satisfactory, speaker, playback, recorded, results, when, head, mounting, is, not, practical.,  , While, the, stereo, image, recording, quality, is, significantly, diminished, with, collar, mounting,, there's, some advantage, when, blocking, (or, at, least, reducing) some, of, the, rear/side, crowd, sounds, is, desired.,  ,  ,  , For, the, best, 3-D, image, fidelity,, listen, to, the, DSM, recording, from, wide, spaced,, precisely, angled, speakers, directed, or, positioned, exactly, the, opposite, (reverse, facing,, 180, degree), direction, of, the, original, live, sound, recording, microphones, as, suggested, below.,  , If, a, DSM, recording, was, made, with, pickups, placed, close, to, the, ears,, best, listening, experience, is, with, open, type, headphones, having, large, 40-50+mm, sized, diaphragm., Jecklin, �Float, Phones�, electrostatics, (at, one, time, sold, by, MAY, AUDIO),, Sony, MDR-F1, or, CD2000,, and, newer, MDR-SA3000/5000, models, are, known, to, reproduce, the, most, natural, sounding, 3-D, and, optimum, high, frequency, details., If, loudspeaker, listening, is, you, main, objective,, position, the, DSM, pickups, further, forward, of, the, ears,, even, centered, into, the, temple, area, for, best, high-frequency, details, perception, with, loudspeaker, playback, systems,  , ., See, Speaker, positioning, (below), for, 2, or, more, speaker, systems, that, allow, for, best, imaging., Dolby, Pro, Logic, II, or, DTS, NEO-6, decoded, speaker, playback, (4, or, more, surround, speakers), will, give, a, realistic, 360, degree, sound, image, with, the, center-side-rear, channels, decoding, the, 2-channel, DSM, stereo-surround, correctly., This, makes, all, DSM, recorded, stereo, sound, virtually, identical, to, the, best, DVD/BD, Movie, audio, surround, experiences, For, more, natural, sounding, listening, experience, with, wider, sweet, spot, seating,, Left/Right, Stereo, Speakers, are, best, positioned, set, at, least, as, wide, apart, as, the, dead, center, sitting, or, listening, distance, is, to, the, (imaginary), connecting, line, running, from, left, to, right, speakers., Angle, the, speakers, inward, to, focus, IN, FRONT, of, the, exact, center, listening, position., Playing, back, regular, stereo, will, sound, better, with, this, arrangement, and, DSM, recorded, sounds, will, have, a, smooth,, seamless, image, that, extends, beyond, the, speakers, for, nearly, a, 180, degree, wide, stereo, image, that, sounds, good, even, if, seated, way, off, dead, center., FORMATTING, OF, FLASH, CARD, MEMORY,  ,  , New, technology, flash, card, recorders, are, very, convenient, in, being, able, to, quickly, transfer, recordings, much, faster, than, real-time,, and, then, reuse, the, memory, card., However,, some, of, the, newer, digital, decks, using, flash, memory, are, VERY, particular, on, the, format, structure, of, this, media., It, is, most, wise, to, ALWAYS, REFORMAT, flash, memory, IN, THE, DECK, whenever, removing, the, memory, card, and, placing, into, a, dedicated, card, reader, for, file, transfer, purposes., In-deck, reformat, avoids, 'mysterious', file, corruption, and, deck, freezes, common, with, using, cards, SLIGHTLY, changed, from, the, deck's, particular, standard, format, during, computer, card, transfer, processes., ALSO, very, good, practice, to, REFORMAT, EVEN, IF, NOT, REMOVED, after, all, recorded, files, needed, have, been, safely, transferred., Just, deleting, files, may, leave, non-continuous, file, space, on, the, card., Complete, reformat, wipes, clean, all, stored, files,, and, insures, the, deck, can, fully, utilize, the, space, in, a, continuous, fashion., Using, a, freshly, reformatted, memory, card, helps, avoid, recording, errors, and, deck, freeze-up, faults.,  , USEFUL, TYPES, OF, FLASH, MEMORY, FOR, AUDIO, RECORDING,  ,  , New, technology, flash, card, recorders, are, totally, immune, to, most, all, physical, movements, and, shocks., Shakes, and, bumps, that, pose, a, liability, to, ruin, the, recording, on, MD,, DAT, tape,, or, hard, drive, decks, are, not, a, problem, with, solid, state, memory, flash, recorders., Some, hard, drive, recorders, also, record, to, flash,, parking, the, hard, drive, heads, for, maximum, shock, resistance., So, it's, good, practice, to, use, flash, for, 'gorilla', field, recording,, later, transferring, to, hard, drive, when, deck, is, safely, at, rest., However,, some, flash, decks, using, solid, state, card, memory, are, particular, to, the, SPEED, TYPE, of, flash, media, used, for, audio, recording, purpose., Very,, very, fast, (some, ultra, types, and, other, advanced, types), cards, mostly, use, a, BURST, speed, rating., This, is, mechanism, useful, for, fastest, transfer, of, many, very, small, (in, comparison, to, audio, file, size), digital, camera, photo, files., Flash, BURST, schemes, do, nothing, good,, sometimes, work, AGAINST, smooth,, continuous, large, file, audio, recording,, and, is, often, the, cause, of, audio, file, interrupts,, corrupted, files,, and, deck, freeze-up., Suggest, using, FAST, proven, reliable, makes/models, of, cards,, like, SanDisk, Ultra, II, that, actual, state, continuous, write/read, speeds,, not, a, burst, speed, rating., Then, you, know, card, has, best, chance, of, working, for, all, audio, recording, purposes.,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , REDUCING, MIC, INPUT, NOISE, The, internal, mic, preamplifier, on, most, battery, powered, portable, recorders, are, mostly, adequate, for, larger, diaphragm,, high, output,, and, 'true, balanced', type, mics., However,, most, (Edirol-Roland, R-1/R-4,, Marantz, PMD-600, series),, the, FR2's, MIC/LINE, balanced, inputs,, are, highly, susceptible, to, internal/external, noise, sources., This, is, especially, true, when, running, on, the, AC, adapter, with, ANY, TYPE, of, mic, input,, and, if, inputting, an, UNBALANCED, lower, output, level, mic, or, unbalanced, line, source, (like, from, standard, configured, DSM, mics,, single, ended, preamplifiers,, and, non-balanced, mic, powering, adapters)., This, is, due, to, less, than, optimized, design, of, most, portable, digital, decks, that, include, digital, noise, getting, into, the, low, level, analog, mic, circuitry,, and, external, electrical, noise, (AC, hum,, radio, signals), working, into, ground, path, circuitry., At, least, one, exception, is, Sound, Devices, 722/744T, decks, and, (some), battery, powered, external, microphone, preamplifiers, with, refined, very, quiet/external-internal, noise, immune, inputs., SUMMARY:, For, lowest, noise, ANALOG, recording, performance,, run, deck, solely, on, battery, power,, and, input, to, these, type, decks, ONLY, true, BALANCED, output, MIC/LINE, externally, connected, equipment., PA-10DXLR5, is, a, true, input/output, balanced, powering, adapter, for, connector, upgraded, DSM, microphones, models., PA-24NJ/X, is, a, balanced, output, external, mic, preamplifier, suitable, for, all, decks, with, balanced, LINE, level, inputs.,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , AVOIDING, ANALOG, INPUT, DECK, OVERLOAD, DISTORTIONS, MOST, Mini-portables, in, use, today, will, overload to, cause, analog, circuit, clipping, distortion., Indication, that, mic, input, stage, clipping, is, likely, occurring, is, when, LEVEL, adjustment, necessitates, turning, down, to, #4, or, below, 30-40%, of, the, adjustment, range, for, seeing, VU, peak, indications, -12, dB, to, -4, dB, peaks, for, most, other, DAT, models.,  , LOOK, where, you, have, this, knob, or, the, up-down, button, adjustment, set., If, set, <, 40%, of, total, REC, adjustment, maximum,, then, good, chance, of, MIC, input, (sometimes, also, LINE), deck, overload,, at, least, until, you, know, better, from, trying, it, first., There, are, two, main, types, of, REC, Level, Adjustment, Displays, taking, the, place, of, the, DAT's, #0, to, #10, REC, LEVEL, level, knob, markings, (like, shown, in, the, picture, above-left), INSTEAD,, most, newer, digital, audio, decks, indicate, the, REC, LEVEL, Adjustment, ON, THE, LCD, DISPLAY;, usually, positioned, somewhere, BELOW, the, VU, indicator, Some, display, a, RECORD, Level, Adjustment, Left-to-Right, reading, BAR, GRAPH, that, indicates, possible, audible, input, overloads, STARTING, when, the, Bar, Graph, shows, about, 35-40%, of, 100%, full, up., If, the, REC, LEVEL, Adjustment, bargraph, indicates, an, adjustment, is, selected, below, 35%, of, full, up,, then, input, clipping, distortion, is, likely, easily, audible., Some, decks, do, not, use, a, bar, graph, to, display, where, you've, set, the, Manual, REC, LEVEL., INSTEAD,, a, series, of, numbers, are, displayed, on, the, LCD, display., The, series, of, setting, numbers, is, sometimes, in, TWO, SETS, when, in, MIC, input, mode, (Sharp, MD)., Displays, of, #0-#20, indicate, the, deck, is, set, in, "L", Low, input, sensitivity, (equivalent, to, the, 20, DB, ATTENuation, setting, on, DAT), and, input, clipping, distortion, is, unlikely, with, number, settings, indicated, at, #8, or, higher, out, of, #20, max,, for, getting, adequate, -12, dB, VU, to, 0, dB, VU, REC, signal, peak, readings., The, second, numbered, set, on, the, Sharp, MD, reads, #21-#30, indicating, the, deck, is, set, in, the, "H", High, mic, input, sensitivity, range, (equivalent, to, the, 0, DB, ATTENuation, setting, on, DAT)., BEST, TO, AVOID, using, the, #21-#30, "H", range., You, are, RISKING, having, input, clipping, distortion, UNLESS, VU, readings, are, unable, to, reach, GREATER, THAN, -14, dB, VU, with, the, deck, set, at, #20., In, other, words,, try, to, keep, maximum, recording, level, input, "headroom", by, staying, in, the, "L", Low, input, sensitivity, range,, UNLESS, VU, is, less, than, -14, dB, peak,, then, good, chance, the, +20, db, "HIGH", boost, setting, is, OK., Below, are, tips, for, using, Sony, M10, recorder:, (Settings, good, for, D50, model), ------------------, TIPS:, (For, highest, quality, recording, purposes), Use, M10, ONLY, set, in, 24, bit, recording, mode., Sample, rate, is, your, choice,, but, suggest, using, 44.1K, sample, rate, if, wanting, best, CD, compatible, editing, options., Use, M10, ONLY, with, MIC, INPUT, sensitivity, switch, set, in, "LOW", taping, over, this, switch, to, not, be, moved., "HIGH", setting, is, way, too, much, 20, dB, boosted, first, stage, gain, giving, inferior, audio, quality., Even, with, very, low, VU, levels,, LOW, setting, gives, cleaner, more, defined, 24bit, depth, audio, best, boosted, in, post, edit,, NOT, by, using, deck, in, HIGH, setting., Allow, for, having, best, headroom, dynamics, with, NOT, pushing, recording, VU, levels., Wise, to, ONLY, push, REC, levels, of, master, recording, to, -12, dB, PEAK, VU, (not, average,, but, maximum, peak, reading), so, recording, has, best, chance, of, never, clipping, even, if, much, louder, unexpected, sound, is, encountered., Use, M10, in, full, manual, (not, AUTO,, Limiter), record, level, control, mode, setting,, suggest, also, taping, over, this, switch, (AS, SHOWN, AT, LEFT), so, these, switches, are, not, moved, accidently., Wise, tact, is, to, always, engage, decj's, HOLD, feature, after, starting, so, touching, deck, buttons, do, not, accidentally, stop, recording, until, you're, finished, with, each, session., Do, all, editing, in, 24, bit, mode,, adjusting, loudness, and, all, other, changes, desired., Then,, as, last, post-edit, step,, convert, a, copy, of, edited, file, as, 16, bit, depth, .wav, if, desiring, CD, burn, file, for, disc, burning, purposes., If, desiring, MP3, conversion,, leave, edited, file, at, 24, bit, depth, as, most, MP3, encoders, work, directly, with, these, without, requiring, down, sampling, conversion., See, taperssection.com, M10, comments/tech, data, GuySonic, posted, at:, http://taperssection.com/index.php?topic=130924.0;all, On, most, models,, the, mic, sensitivity, input, switch, actually, changes, the, first, stage, amplifier, gain, instead, of, conventional, reduction, of, mic, signal, via, resistor, attenuation, network, positioned, before, the, mic, amplifier., Sharp, MiniDisc, decks, also, reconfigure, the, gain, of, the, mic, preamplifier, from, low, gain, to, boosted, gain, when, crossing, from, #0-#20, record, level, adjustment, to, #21-#30, record, level, setting, range., Depending, on, the, output, or, sensitivity, of, the, microphone, being, used, and, how, loud, the, sound, recorded, is,, the, L, or, -20, db, Attenuated, position, MAY, NOT, lower, the signal, sufficiently, to, avoid, overloads.,  , This, is, common when, using, the, larger, diaphragm, (capsule), sized, and/or, higher, output, 48, volt, phantom, powered, microphones, recording, amplified, Pop/Rock, venues., In, this, case, there, are, three, options:, 1), Use, the, Attenuation, switch, (commonly, found, on, the, microphone, body), or,  , 2), Install, an, in-series, attenuation, network, between, the, microphone, and, the, deck,, but, NOT, between, the, microphone, and, it's, source, of, 'Phantom, power', (when, mic, is, without, an, internal, battery, supply).,  , 3), Use, the, LINE, input(s), on, the, deck, which, have, at, least, -20, dB, less, gain, that, mic, inputs, and, are, much, more, resistant, to, be, overdriven, with, direct, Level, Knob, control(s);, exception, is, the, Sony, D7/8, decks, where, the, Level, Knob, does, not, totally, control, the, line, input, signal, from, causing, clipping, distortion, from, very, high, 'Pro, mixing, board, type', inputs., SUMMARY:, Remember, the, #0, to, #20, or, "L", Low, mic, sensitivity, or, -20, dB, attenuation, MIC, INPUT, mode, is, the, NORMAL, setting, for, these, decks., The, other,, higher, (boosted), gain, mode, should, not, be, used, for, quality, mic, input, purposes, (maybe, best, for, dictation,, lecture/seminar, low, level, recording),, UNLESS, UNABLE, to, reach, 50%, half, VU, scale, or, -14, dB, VU, with, loudest, momentary, peaks., USE, the, Line, input, with, large, (diaphragm/capsule), MICS, (especially, 24-48, volt), for, moderate-to-VERY-LOUD, live, events., INPUT, SETTING, TIPS, ON, NON-STOCK, DAT, DECKS, WITH, (OADE, MOD), LOWERED, PREAMP, GAIN, In, a, message, dated, 11/16/01, 6:43:09, AM, Pacific, Standard, Time,, txxxxxx@msn.com, writes:, <<, I, have, been, 'studying', your, recording, tips,, so, I, THINK, I, know, what, to, do, for, a, quality, recording., The, only, thing, I'm, afraid, of, is, turning, my, record, setting, ABOVE, '4'., I, have, never, had, to, record, above, that, level,, but, I'm, hoping, your, mics, will, allow, me, to, go, above, that,, to, avoid, clipping., Tom, Axxxxxx, >>, Hello, Tom,, I, think, you've, got, this, tip, totally, BACKWARDS., Setting, the, level, knob, Below, #4, or, below, (for, having, VU, readings, about, -12, dB, VU), means, your, mic, input, to, the, preamplifier, or, the, input, gain, is, way, too, much,, and, the, bass, is, getting, clipped, even, if, the, VU, level, shows, it, is, not, overloading!, Knob, settings, above, #4.5, (to, #10, max), means, your, mic, input, level, (and, setting, of, the, 0, dB, and, 20, dB, attenuate, switch), is, totally, OK., Please, reread, the, http://www.sonicstudios.com/tips.htm, page., Also, realize, that, most, people, with, a, DSM, pop/rock, low, gain, mic, USUALLY, MUST, have, the, M1, DAT, deck, in, the, 20, dB, attenuate, switch, setting, for, recording, amplified, club/concert, music,, and, also, remember, to, use, only, the, MANUAL, recording, mode., HOWEVER,, BECAUSE, OADE, MODIFIED, YOUR, DECK, TO, HAVE, LOWER, MIC, PREAMP, GAIN,, YOU, WILL, find, the, 0, dB, attenuate, setting, IS, MORE, LIKE, THE, NORMAL, (stock, -20, dB, deck), SETTING,, FOR, THIS, DECK, ONLY., YOU, MAY, STILL, BE, OK, to, use, the, 20, dB, setting, for, most, loud, music, concert, venues, and, the, loudest, of, club, type, venues., HOWEVER,, if, you, CANNOT, get, the, -12, dB, VU, average, reading, with, having, #10, LEVEL, KNOB, (turned, full, up), with, the, 20, dB, setting,, ONLY, THEN, USE, the, 0, dB, switch, setting,, turning, the, level, knob, down, (but, hopeful, not, below, #4.5), to, get, about, 50%, VU, deflections, or, -12, dB, VU, average, peak, readings., ALSO, READ, TAPERS, TIPS, for, more, tips, on, keeping, the, recording, level, adjustment, appropriate, for, the, music., IN, OTHER, WORDS,, your, deck, is, NOT, STOCK, (With, having, the, OADE, MOD),, so, some, of, the, suggestions, saying, that, 20, dB, or, LOW, sensitivity, is, the, normal, DOES, NOT, ALWAYS, APPLY, TO, YOUR, CURRENT, M1, OADE, MODIFIED, DECK., So,, you, may, have, to, boost, the, mic, preamplifier, gain, to, 0, dB, setting, (which, is, a, NO-NO, on, a, stock, DAT, deck, for, recording, not, so, loud, Rock/Pop, venues),, but, ONLY, if, the, 20, dB, setting, gives, too, little, gain/VU, levels., Follow, these, tips, carefully, and, PRACTICE, by, going, out, to, record, some, really, loud, club, type, pop/rock, music, A, FEW, TIMES., Much, better, to, make, your, mistakes, during, practice, than, mess, up, during, the, U2, event., Most, large, concerts, should, actually, be, a, bit, to, alot, louder, (and, cleaner, sounding), than, most, club, venues,, so, using, the, 20, dB, deck, setting, with, nearly, full, up, to, #10, level, knob, is, likely, the, best, loud, concert, recording, setting, to, start, with, even, with, having, the, OADE, mod,, but, please, be, prepared, for, big, events, with, having, some, practice, first., Best, Regards,, Leonardo, (Back, to, Tapers, Tips, Page),  , (Back, to, Page, Top), Maintain Mini-Stereo, Jack/Plug, Contacts, &, Strain, Relieve, Mic, Cords, Smaller, is, Better, for, some, things, and, not, for, others., As, portable, recording, decks,, jacks,, and, plugs, get, smaller,, the, need, to, compensate, for, less, contact, area, and, spring, force, becomes, increasingly, important, to, insure, consistent, results, when, recording.,  , Small, decks, are, dependable, as, long, as, the, recordist, is, aware, of, the, limitations;, therefore,, some, important, facts, about, what�s, not, so, robust, and, problematic, about, the, smaller, connection, hardware, is, important, to, know., FACT:, Mini-stereo, contact, spring, pressure, is, far, less, than, on, 1/4�, &, XLR, type, connectors., RESULT:, Fingerprint, residue, that�s, not, always, wiped, off, before, plugging-in, will, collect, inside, the, jack,, and, quickly, interfere, with, signal, purity,, even, generate, severe, static, (mic, DC, power), noises., The, lighter, contact, forces, of, mini-connectors, don�t, push, aside, the, film, coating, of, grease, and, grim, as, do, much, larger, connectors.,  Also, realize, that, it�s, almost, impossible, to, handle, a, mini-mic., plug, without, touching, the, metal, surface,, leaving, fingerprint, residue, on, the, plug, that�s, deposited, into, the, mic, jack, with, each, insertion, cycle.,  As, each, insertion, continues, to, add, more, residue,, the, contacts, reach, �saturation�, and, can, no, longer, push, aside, this, toughening, film., Furthermore,, contact, corrosion, from, fingerprint, salts, (like, that, of, sea, water), eventually, eats, up, the, metal, when, moisture, is, present.,  This, produces, slightly, audible, degradation, of, the, signal, quality, at, best, to, complete, intermittent, interruption, of, delicate, mic., Signals, and, will, ruin, the, recording, in, the, worst, case.,  , When, phantom, type, power, is, also, supplied, to, the, microphones, through, the, mic., jack, (as, with, external, microphone, "Plug-in-Power", feature, common, to, portable, Video,, DAT, &, MiniDisc, decks),, highly, audible, static, type, noise, is, the, result.,  This, is, especially, audible, when, the, microphones, plug, is, only, slightly, moved, by, an, unsecured, mic., cord., SOLUTION, TO, MINI-CONNECTOR, STATIC, NOISE, AND, INTERMITTENT, AUDIO, IS, AS, FOLLOWS:, Clean, &, recondition, noisy, mic., jacks, with, 91, -, 99%, pure, isopropyl, alcohol.,  Repeatedly, insert, a, headphone, type, plug, soaked, to, the, point, of, dripping, (filling, the, alcohol, bottle, cap, and, dipping, only, the, metal, part, of, the, mini-plug, works, well), into, the, mic., Jack, until, any, connection, noise, disappears.,  Monitor, the, progress, with, a, set, of, headphones, while, the, deck, is, in, a, record, function.,  Rotating, the microphones, plug, should, not, produce, audible, noise, with, cleaned, and, conditioned, contacts.,   Applying, a, contact, conditioner, to, already, cleaned, plug, and, jack, metal, parts, (Stereo, retailer, &, Sonic, Studios, available, ProGold, by, CAIG, Labs, works, great), once, to, several, times, a, year, will, help, protect, contacts, from, corrosion/wear, and, from, producing, noise, for, much, longer, between, cleanings., (Return, to, Tapers, Tips, Page),  , CAUTION, IS, ADVISED:, AVOID, PLACING, CONTACT, CLEANER, ON, ANYTHING, BUT, THE, METAL, CONNECTOR, PARTS;, Plastics, can, be, softened,,  discolored,, and, even, dissolved!,  This, may, actually, coat, the, very, metal, contacts, intended, for, cleaning!,  , Fortunately,,  deck, input, jacks, are, reasonably, resistant, to, alcohol, and, most, �plastic, safe�, cleaners, when, used, occasionally, and, with, care., WARNING:, Never, spray, anything, into, the, jacks, on, a, deck.,   Most, Minideck, jacks, are, not, the, enclosed, type, anymore,, but, are, open,, allowing, sprays, to, go, where, they, can, cause, mechanical, problems, with, the, mechanical, type, transport, mechanisms, and, coat, the, tape/optical, head(s).,  Use, the, method, described, above, with, the, miniplug,, or, purchase, a, special, plastic, cleaning, brush, from, CAIG, or, Sonic, Studios, (a, tapered, shaver/dental, plague, cleaning, brush, may, also, be, used)., Avoiding, The, Mini, Connector, Shortcomings, For, Professional, Work:, TCD-D100, &, PCM-M1, DAT, Deck, Tip, Always, wipe, off, the, mic, plug, before, plugging-in, with, a, clean, cotton, cloth, (or, shirt), or, tissue, paper., The, plug, should, be, mirror-bright-shiny, clean, before, making, the, connection., Click, for, MiniDISC, MIC, cord, securing, &, General, MD, recording, setup, tips, (The, photos, on, the, left, and, far, below, illustrate, the, best, strategy, for, Sony, DAT,, MD,, and, portable, audio, hard, disk, recording, decks), 2), Secure, the, mic, cord, between, the, deck, and, the, carrying, case,, or, use, Velcro, to, prevent, connection, movement, noise,, spontaneous, unplugging,, &, input, jack, damaging, strains, from, occurring., (Right), The, input/output, cords, are, both, secured, with, PA-24NJ, preamp's, integral, Velcro, tie., A, more, permanent, smart, right-angle, mic., cord, bend, around, the, deck, is, best, produced, by, carefully, heating, the, entire, bend, section, (a, hair, dryer, is, handy),, applying, the, necessary, bend,, then, let, cool, before, releasing, the, bend., The, Sharp, MD-MT20, minidisc, deck, has, room, for, just, 1, cord, securing, strap., Position, the, 2, Velcro, patches, (the, hook, type), as, shown, to, avoid, blocking, anything, important., Secure, the, cord, with, the, bridging, strap, (the, loop, type), as, shown, above.,  , PA, Adapters, are, accessory, for, powering, DSM, mics, and, have, options, of, also, having, "Bass, Cut", filters., The, Input, Jack, to, the, PA, connects, to, the, DSM, mic, output, Plug., This, interface, should, be, kept, from, disconnection, or, movement, by, using, one, of, the, two, available, moveable, cord, securing, straps, as, illustrated, here, in, the, two, photo, tips., The, PA's, output, plug, is, secured, to, the, deck, just, like, the, DSM, mic, plug/cord, shown, in, the, previous, tips., Are, Gold, Plated, Connectors, Naturally, Better?, Gold, is, plated, onto, a, connectors, base, metal, and, is, a, <5, to, ~25, micro-inches, very, thin, to, extra, thick, plating;, usually, much, less, than, 5, micro-inches, is, used., It, may, be, surprising, to, know, that, Gold, is, NOT, the, best, conductor, of, electricity,, silver, is, far, better,, with, copper, just, behind, as, the, most, common, materials, in, use, these, days., However,, Gold, does, make, a, better, and, more, consistent, electrical, contact, because, it, is, corrosion, resistant, to, most, everything., But, what, may, really, matter, the, most, is, what's, UNDERNEATH, the, Gold, plating., Gold, is, very,, very, soft, metal, and, is, easily, pushed, aside, leaving, the, base, metal, of, the, connector, to, show, through, in, the, most, used, areas,, which, is, exactly, the, area, where, the, metal-to-metal, electrical, connection, takes, place., Most, frequently, the, underneath, base, metal, on, gold, plated, plugs, is, BRASS;, this, looks, a, lot, like, the, gold, plating, until, it, tarnishes, and, gold, plates, very, easily, to, the, brass, metal, alloy., In, contrast,, most, NON-Gold, plated, connectors, have, a, form, of, nickel, plating, (over, brass), that, is, also, very, corrosion, resistant,, but, not, as, corrosion, resistant, as, gold., However,, nickel, plating, is, made, thicker, than, gold, and, is, a, much, less, soft, metal;, lasts, much, much, longer, as, a, plate, for, sliding, contact, purposes., If, the, gold, plating, is, really, thin, (most, usual, for, consumer, gear),, then, using, just, brass, underneath, allows, the, connector, to, look, 'good, as, gold', in, the, store,, BUT, after, getting, used, a, bit,, the, gold, plating, will, wear, through, to, expose, brass, to, corrosion., Here, is, the, bad, news:, brass, metal, surfaces, will, quickly, corrode, to, having, a, very,, very, hard, surface, skin, (acts, like, anodized, aluminum, that, resist, further, deep, corrosion), that, will, not, conduct, electricity., This, leaves, you, with, a, far, worse, connection, than, most, anything, you, can, think, of., Mostly, leaves, you, with, no, connection, until, something, scrapes, down, hard, on, the, brass, to, make, a, good, but, very, temporary, connection, again., So, as, the, gold, wears, off,, the, brass, shines, through, to, tarnish;, hard, to, keep, from, making, anything, but, very, inconsistent, and, mostly, poor, connections., This, is, the, bad, news, with, these, types, of, gold, plated, connectors,, especially, after, they, get, worn, from, active, cycles, of, plug, and, unplug, use., The, commercial, electronics, industry, also, makes, use, of, gold, plating, for, sliding, contacts,, BUT, ONLY, after, a, 15, to, 50, micro-inch, plating, of, NICKEL, is, first, laid, down, on, copper, (PC, circuit, boards), or, brass/steel, (as, for, quality, military/commercial, connectors)., In, this, way,, as, the, Gold, predictably, gets, worn, away, after, repeated, working,, but, there, is, still, a, good, nickel, plating, metal, contact, underneath., This, dual, plating, method, always, insures, that, some, kind, of, good, reliable, electrical, contact, surface, remains, after, years, of, active, service., With, Gold, plate, over, nickel,, the, brass, or, steel, base, metals, rarely, ever, wears, through, the, nickel, in, normal, expected, use., So,, it, is, often, best, NOT, to, get, the, gold, plated, connectors, as, they, more, often, DO, NOT, MAKE, A, GOOD, CONNECTION, after, too, short, a, time, of, use., Better, to, get, more, durable, nickel, (sometimes, made, better, with, silver, alloy), types, that, last, far, longer, and, can, be, cleaned, with, alcohol, easily., Brass, does, not, clean, well, and, needs, an, abrasive, material, to, scrape, down, to, some, newer, brass;, like, using, a, pencil, eraser, or, extra, fine, abrasive, grit, paper., Why, the, makers, of, these, connectors, do, not, first, plate, nickel, over, the, base, BEFORE, gold, is, almost, a, mystery, to, me,, but, go, to, Radio, Shack, and, take, a, look, at, all, those, gold, plated, connector, parts., They, all, seem, just, Gold, plated, over, Brass;, not, good, at, all., Using, Brass, as, the, only, base, metal, seems, to, look, better, when, using, the, usual, very, thin, Gold, plating;, you, will, buy, this, quicker, than, the, appearance, of, thin, gold, over, nickel,, it, would, not, be, as, bright, or, 'gold, looking', I, would, guess., If, you, have, gold, connectors,, then, I, strongly, suggest, NOT, using, anything, abrasive, to, clean, them, (at, least, until, the, gold, is, worn, out, in, critical, places),, just, use, pure, 91%, isopropyl, alcohol, on, a, cloth., I, suggest, using, some, ProGold, contact, conditioner, to, the, cleaned, connector, to, help, keep, the, brass, base, metal, from, wearing, through, the, gold, very, quickly., Remember,, that, which, is, golden, is, not, necessarily, the, best, connector, for, the, long, run., NOTE:, Sonic, Studios, gold, plated, connectors, are, a, full, 25, micro-inches, of, gold, OVER, 50, micro-inches, of, high, quality, nickel, plate;, this, will, always, provide, long, life, and, reliable, connections, for, many,, thousands, of, cycles, and, for, years, of, challenging, environmental, exposure., A, technical, sheet, on, connectors, and, what, happens, to, gold, with, and, without, ProGold, treatment, is, linked, to, my, accessories, page, at:, http://www.sonicstudios.com/access.htm, Recording, MUSIC, with, Bass, Filters:, Advisory, <<, -------------, DAT-Heads, Digest, Query, -----------------, Date:, FBI,, 21, Jul, 2000, 18:08:44, -0500, From:, ", J, V, ", Subject:, Bass, filter, for, older, Sonic, Studios, DSM-6P, I'm, looking, for, a, an, inline, bass, roll-off, box, (preferably, with, adjustable, settings), that, will, be, fully, compatible, with, the, Sonics, DSM-6, P, (, the, older, hardwired, power, supply, model), ,, i.e.,, it, can, accept, a, 1/8, inch, stereo, plug, and, can, plug, into, the, 1/8, inch, mic, input, on, my, M-1., I, understand, Marcsounds, used, to, carry, something, similar, to, this,, are, they, still, around, ?, john, >>------------------------------, GuySonic, Replies:, IN-Series, Bass, filters, for, electret, are, mostly, too, specialized, to, mix, and, match, from, different, mic, models/makes., The, unique, driving, ability, or, impedance, of, a, particular, mic, capsule, AND, the, input, resistance, (Impedance), of, the, deck's, input, will, greatly, effect, both, the, mic's, AND, the, filters, performance, and, quality, factors;, the, parameters, are, INTERACTIVE., In, other, words,, mixing, is, not, a, good, idea, in, this, case, for, more, than, one, reason, and, especially, if, you, care, about, getting, specific, and, quality, results, without, needing, to, be, also, extremely, lucky., In, specific, to, John's, situation,, the, suggested, solution, is, to, change, the, hardwired, DSM-6P, (vintage), version, to, being, up-to-date, with, current, DSM, models., This, would, allow, connection, to, any, of, the, current, PA, powering, +, Bass, filter, models, that, best, fit, his, particular, recording, requirement., (SEE, PA, powering, and, bass, filter, adapter, chart, on, page:, http://www.sonicstudios.com/pa_x.htm), The, best, service, now, for, the, updating, of, older, DSM-, 6P, models, is, the, low, cost, DSM, mic, "Refurbishment", service, that, includes, the, new, model, form-factor, update, +, diaphragm, clean, +, new, windscreens, =, mics, look, and, work, like, a, brand-new-one, and, can, be, directly, powered, by, portable, DAT/MD, decks, and/or, a, PA., bass, filtering, adapter., AND, WHILE, ON, THIS, TOPIC:, It, seems, that, "a, bit, too, much, that, bass, filtering", is, an, easy, thing, to, do, when, all, you, got, to, do, is, slide, a, switch, and, viola!, ........, there's, now, less, bass, in, the, recording., Microphone, BASS, Filtering, can, be, a, good, thing, to, even, up, the, overall, "tone", balance, of, a, recording, AND, it, also, gives, more, analog, input, or, recording, "headroom", that, helps, to, enhance, the, overall, resolution, of, higher, frequencies., In, other, words,, you, can, turn, up, the, REC, level, a, lot, more, FOR, MIDS, AND, HIGHS, because, the, strongest, (bass), sound, component, is, now, at, a, much, lower, deck, input, level., Sometimes, it's, not, that, you, can, do, it, (reduce, the, bass, content, with, a, filter),, but, it's, really, about, knowing, WHEN, and, WHEN, NOT, and, HOW, MUCH, TO, reduce, bass, sounds., If, the, sound, is, SO, loud, that, your, hearing, gets, distorted, OR, if, you, are, prudent, in, saving, your, ears, with, wearing, earplugs, (especially, when, right-up, close, to, the, stacks),, you, MAY, NOT, be, HEARING, the, overall, tonal, balance, of, the, venue, WELL, ENOUGH, TO, MAKING, the, most, appropriate, bass, filter, selection., Too, many, recordings, I've, lately, heard, seem, to, error, on, WAY, TOO, MUCH, BASS, FILTERING, as, to, lose, most, sense, of, the, real, "GUT, and, emotional, FEELing", of, the, music;, this, is, big, part, of, the, live, sound, that, I, personally, find, important., However,, very, "thin, sounding, recordings", are, MORE, OFTEN, caused, by, POST, BASS, Filtering, in, a, digital, sound, editing, (DAW), program, than, by, the, use, of, real-time, microphone, filtering,, but, both, mechanisms, can, do, equal, damage, or, benefit, to, a, recording, DEPENDING., That's, 'Depending', on, your, own, taste, in, sound, preferences, and, 'depending', on, what's, the, most, important, aspects, of, a, particular, music, style., For, example;, Maybe, some, Metal, Rock, styles, are, most, cherished, by, the, majority, of, their, fans, for, that, 'screaming, in-you-face', guitar/vocals, style, that, is, impossible, to, hear, from, being, buried, in, massive, bass, sounds, if, played, 'straight', on, home, stereos., Lose, most, of, the, bass, by, filtering, and, you'll, get, the, "in-your-face", guitar/vocal, aspect, much, easier, with, regular, good, quality, consumer, playback, gear., The, only, problem, is, it's, a, bit, on, the, thin, sound, side, of, live,, but, the, more, important, aspects, of, the, music, is, most, accessible, to, fans., QUESTION:, Would, you, THINK, to, strip, the, 'Gut, Thumping, Bass', sound, out, of, most, REGGAE, music?, Well,, of, course, you, could,, either, during, the, recording, with, a, mic, filter, OR, afterwards, with, POST, in, pure, digital, editing., But,, before, you, do, it,, please, try, to, remember, that, a, big, part, of, Reggae, and, African, music, IS, THE, POWERFUL, BASS, Sounds., Of, Course, THERE, ARE, TIMES, when, you, really, NEED, to, OR, really, SHOULD, (and, maybe, ONLY, SLIGHTLY), reduce, the, Bass, to, achieve, a, better, balance, between, a, 'live, sound', feel, and, what's, going, to, work, with, most, speaker, playback, systems, we, have, at, home, or, automobile., Just, be, careful, to, not, take, away, so, much, that, the, "ambient, or, live, feel", of, the, recording, is, inaccessible, by, a, thin, sounding, and, over, processed, sounding, recording.,  , DSM, Questions, &, Answers, DSM, Durable?, Using, in, the, RAIN, Fragile, Foam, 'Windscreens', Event, Recording, Setup, Question:, How, durable, are, they?,  Both, the, mic, unit, and, the, wiring.,  For, instance,, is, it, OK, to, wrap, the, cord, tight, and, get, it, all, into, the, smaller, container?,  Will, the, loops, that, go, around, the, glasses, take, a, time, crush, push, into, position, in, the, dark, without, breaking,, or, should, that, be, done, very, carefully?, Answer:,  Mic,, cord,, &, rubber, loop, are, more, durable, than, you, might, think., I, will, suggest, carefully, winding, the, cord, without, twisting;, like, coiling, a, hairdryer, power, cord, around, dryer, body, (like, Warren, Beatty, did, in, the, movie, �Shampoo�), so, the, coiled, cord, is, layered, flat, without, a, single, twist!,  This, takes, just, a, little, more, time, and, effort, to, keep, the, cord, as, compact, as, you, want, without, ever, showing, a, wrinkle;, without, a, twist., Done in, this, manner,, the, cord, can, be, compactly, coiled, without, stress.,  Practice, at, home, with, this.,  (And, untangle, that, twisted, hairdryer, cord!), ALSO,, the, hinged, black, plastic, capsule, �pill, box�, in, the, DSM, mic, locking, hard, case, IS, REMOVABLE;, YOU, CAN, PLACE, JUST, THE, TWO, PICKUPS, INSIDE, FOR, SAFE, POCKET, CARRYING., Pull, this, out, and, use, it, often, to, protect, the, mics, �in, transit�, when, not, mounted, on, the, eyeglasses, or, headband., It, may, work, better, to, already, have, the, mics, mounted, on, your, eyeglasses, and, have, them, hanging, down, at, chest, level, in, a, casual, manner.,  A, dark, or, dark-patterned, shirt, or, opened, jacket, will, make, the, pickups, mostly, disappear, from, viewing.,  Another, technique, is, to, have, the, pickups, secured, under, your, shirt, collar,, pulling, out, to, attach, later, when, seated.,  A, firm,, deliberate,, and, smooth, mounting, and, assembly, effort, (avoid, hasty, actions), is, best, with, all, recording, equipment, connections, and, setup;, a, relaxed, and, confident, manner, will, not, attract, attention, or, damage, your, equipment.,  , (Back, to, Q&A) ,  (Back, to, Page, Top), Question:, What, if, it, starts, raining, on, me, and, I�m, wearing, them?, Answer:,  Water, will, not, harm, the, mics, but,, if, enough, water, gets, on, the, foam, windscreen,, the, sound, will, be, reduced;, if, on, the, inside, diaphragm,, the, sound, will, be, mostly, muted, until, the, mics, dry, out, completely.,  If, it, should, rain, and, your, hair, is, too, short, to, deflect, the, moisture,, keep, a, cap, with, enough, of, a, brim, to, shade, the, pickups, from, wind, driven, rain., Dense, fog, is, usually, not, a, problem, unless, there, is, also, a, wind, blowing, directly, into, the, windscreen;, this, will, �drive�, moisture, into, the, foam,, might, cause, sounds, to, be, water, attenuated, after, a, period, of, time.,  The WHB, windscreen, headband, protects, all, water, from, reaching, the, foam, and, mic, diaphragms, but,, the, headband, fabric, can, get, water, saturated, to, the, point, where, the, sound, gets, attenuated, a, little, bit, ;, not, a, serious, problem, unless, in, a, soaking, downpour, where, an, umbrella, should, be, employed., Back, to, Q&A) , Question:,  Any, concerns, the, little, wind, screen, will, fall, off?, Answer:,  After, 4-8, years, of, steady, usage, the, windscreens, can, get, bit, worn, but,, none, have, actually, fallen, (completely), off, even, after, 8, years., The, mic, diaphragms, can, be, cleaned, after, 3-5, years, of, usage, (suggested, $85, refurbish, service), and, a, new, windscreen, can, be, attached, at, that, time., If, you, (are, the, first to!), experience, any, �lifting�, of, the, windscreen, within, two, years,, the, windscreen, will, be, repaired, at, no, charge.,  (Back, to, Q&A) ,   (Back, to, Page, Top), Question:,  I�m, psyched, to, use, them!, I�m, just, needing, a, little, guidance, about, care.,  I�m, generally, pretty, careful,, but, when, I�m, in, a, hurry, (the, lights, went, down, as, I�m, headed, to, my, seat...), I, can, be, a, little, reckless..., Answer:,  �Haste, makes, waste�, is, a, good, motto, to, abide, by, here!, I, well, know, that, feeling, and, excitement, to, get, the, recording, equipment, set, up, and, operating, while, keeping, from, distracting, my, neighbors, with, my, passion, for, recording, AND, get, it, operating, BEFORE, the, program, starts!!!,  Can�t, miss, note, with, out, regret!, You, will, not, damage, the, mics, with, reckless, abandon, (unless, you, step, on, the, pickups!), but,, you, may, do, damage, to, your, deck�s, input, jacks, and, transport, if, not, ESPECIALLY, very, gentle, and, careful, when, loading, and, unloading, the, tape;, do, make, sure, the, lid, is, ALL, THE, WAY, OPEN, until, the, latch, �clicks�, before, handling, the, tape., It, does, well, to, give, yourself, as, much, time, to, set, up, or, much, better, to, have, everything, mostly, in, place, and, ready, before, walking, in., I, like, to, have, the, glasses, hanging, down, on, my, chest, and, connected, to, the, deck, in, my, pocket, or, equipment, pouch, when, entering., I�ve, already, tested, that, the, mic,, deck,, tape,, and, connections, worked, by, doing, a, test, recording, at, home, or, before, walking, in., (I, do, this, for, may, own, piece, of, mind, and, nerves)., When, I, do, get, to, my, seat,, I, start, by, pulling, the, deck, out, (within, 3-5, minutes, of, the, venue, start),, turning, it, on, and, pushing, the, REC, button, ONCE, only, for, setup, standby, (not, in, pause, II, mode, yet),, double, check, that, I�ve, got, the, deck, in, MANUAL, LEVEL, (NOT, AUTO),, MIC, SENS, in, (L),, adjust, the, LEVEL, knob, up, (4-10), until, getting, a, definite, VU, indication,, and, put, on, the, glasses, �just, before, the, program, starts�, when, everyone�s, attention, is, mostly, on, the, stage, (even, when, recording, with, complete, permission,, a, taper, can, be, distracting, to, those, around, enjoying, the, show, so, try, to, be, considerate)., To, Record,, (TCD-D7, &, D8/D100), now, push, the, PAUSE, (II), button, TWICE, to, have, the, deck, actually, load, the, tape, AND, start, recording., Make, sure, the, deck, is, still, NOT, IN, PAUSE, and, is, really, recording, by, pushing, the, display, Counter, MODE, button, until, the, either, REM, (remaining, tape, time), or, ABS, (absolute), time, indicator, shows;, this, will, show, 00:00:01, seconds, ticking, off, (up, or, down), if, the, tape, is, actually, in, motion., You, will, see, the, 00:00:00, time, display, changing, where, before, in, pause, it, was, not., You, now, are, making, a, recording;, occasionally, check, the, deck�s, VU, but,, mostly, enjoy, the, show!, When, the, venue, starts,, adjust, for, maximum, VU, peak, at, around, -12, VU, and, leave, it, there, unless, the, show, gets, louder, later, on;, then, leave, it, there, unless, it, later, gets, louder, still.,  , NOTE:, The, D100/M1, (with, more, accurate, VU, over, D7/8), &, SBM-1, allow, for, fewer, quality, compromises, when, recording, to, close, to, maximum, 0, dB, (100%), VU, peaks,, but, care, must, be, taken, to, avoid, overrange, clipping., Best, to, be, conservative, with, average, VU, readings, of, -12dB, (50%, full, scale), with, occasional, signals, reading, no, higher, than, -4, dB, (~75%), MAX, VU, peaks, in, most, cases., This, is, good, advice, for, getting, cleanest, sounding, recordings, on, BOTH, DAT, and, MiniDisc, recorders., You, can, look, up, and, down, without, much, affecting, the, recorded, sound, but, avoid, looking, to, the, left, or, right, if, possible;, this, will, affective, the, recording.,  Grooving, with, the, music, with, side, to, side, or, �bopping�, head, motions, is, completely, acceptable, and, recommended, when, appropriate., Avoid, being, a, distraction:,  When, everyone, is, bopping, and, somebody, is, like, a, statue,, guess, who, stands, out?,  The, statue, is, distracting, to, those, around, you, gets, noticed, every, time, in, a, crowd, of, bopping, people!,  , So,, get, with, the, show, like, everyone, else, and, take, home, a, great, recorded, personal, memory.,  (Back, to, Q&A) ,  (Back, to, Page, Top), DECK, MAINTENANCE, TIPS, DECK, Cleaning, Tips:,  , Avoid, getting, alcohol, into, any, of, the, moving, part�s, bearings,, gears,, and, cams, as, this, would, dilute, the, important, lubrication, for, these, parts;, never, spray, any, solvent, into, a, tape, mechanism, to, avoid, removing, or, displacing, lubrication, from, and, onto, other, areas.,  Always, use, the, smallest, alcohol, holding, foam, swab, that, still, allows, a, decent, cleaning, area, and, precision, placement, to, only, the, areas, within, and, concerning, the, tape, path.,  , Do, be, careful, with, the, pinch, roller, and, especially, the, capstan, bearing, to, avoid, running, alcohol, down, the, capstan, and, into, the, bearing, lubrication, area;, invert, the, deck, if, possible, to, change, the, direction, of, gravity, fed, runoff, to, be, away, from, this, bearing.,  ,  , In, other, words,, always, use, as, little, cleaning, solution, as, possible, to, avoid, contamination, from, solvent, runoff, into, lubricated, parts, areas;, this, can, bleed, lubrication, from, where, it, needs, to, be, and, run, it, to, where, it, should, never, be!!,  , Often, 'foam, tipped', swabs, absorb, too, much, solvent, for, safe, cleaning.,  Instead,,  wet, a, lint, free, cotton, cloth, placed, over, the, swab, or, handle, for, more, sensitive, area, cleaning;, i.e.,, capstan, spindle/pinch, roller., The, most, important, areas, of, maintenance, remain, the, rotating, or, stationary, heads;, less, frequently,, and, on, very, used, decks...the, rubber, pinch, roller, (cleaned, &, reconditioned, with, CAIG, Labs, RBR, product).....capstan, spindle.....and, lastly......tape, path, guides, are, much, less, likely, to, be, of, any, problem;, best, serviced, with, the, occasional, dry, fabric, tape, mentioned.,  ,  (Back, to, Page, Top), THREE, BASIC, TYPES, OF, CLEANING, TAPES, COMMON, ABRASIVE, WET-DRY, TAPES, NON-ABRASIVE, DRY, FABRIC, TAPE, There, seems, to, be, (3)three, distinct, type, cleaning, tapes, sold, today, for, maintaining, R-DAT, machines., There's, the, very, common, dry, abrasive, type,, the, wet-dry, fabric, type,, and, the, dry, fabric, type, (DIC, DAT).,  Service, shops, generally, recommend, the, first, (abrasive), category, listed, below, but,, there, are, proponents, who, argue, that, any, one, type, is, superior, to, the, others., The, real, reason, for, using, a, cleaning, tape, is, to, prevent, or, remove, recording/playback, head-clogs;, the, effects, are, usually, noticeable, as, a, loss, of, high, frequency, resolution, and/or, "stuttering"., (Stuttering, is, most, noticeable, during, playback, of, a, good, recording, when, dropout, error-correction, circuits, cannot, keep, up, with, lost, data, due, to, head, clogs, that, force, the, head, away, from, close, contact, with, the, tape, surface.), Head, clogging, also, effects, the, recording, process, in, similar, manner, but, errors, are, permanently, tape, recorded., Regular, cleaning, and, good, quality, recording, tapes, is, good, preventative, maintenance, for, all, tapers.,   , COMMON, ABRASIVE, DAT, CLEANING, TAPES,  (Back, to, Cleaning, Tape, Types), The, first,, and, most, common, used,, is, the, abrasive, type, that, utilizes, a, mildly, abrasive, tape, good, for, over, 100, cleanings.,  The, tape, removes, deposits, that, clog, heads, by, a, polishing, action.,  This, type, of, cleaning, tape, will, not, be, very, effective, in, removing, particulate, or, residues, from, other, than, the, rotating, recording/playback, heads, but,, seems, effective, most, times, in, curing, a, bad, case, of, DAT, "stutter"., Some, service, shops, recommend, regular, use, of, an, abrasive, cleaner, claiming, increased, head, life!,  The, idea, here, seems, to, be, that, recording, heads, need, a, regular, aggressive, re-polishing, cycle, to, reform, the, micro-sized, head, surface, shape, or, to, remove, a, head, clogging, 'hard-glazed, tape, residue', ;, perhaps, at, the, expense, of, increased, DAT, head, wear-down!,  , Service, technicians, are, also, quick, to, point, out, that, regular, DAT, recording, tape, is, abrasive, anyway;, therefore,, R-DAT, heads, (like, VCR's), are, actually, constantly, "cleaning", themselves, in, a, wear, down, process, and, really, shouldn't, need, cleaning, if, quality, recording, tape, that's, in, good, condition, (not, worn, out), is, used., My, personal, experience,, while, limited,, has, lead, me, to, handle, each, DAT, deck, individually;even, if, I, have, two, of, same, model;, one, may, regularly, develop, clogs,, while, the, "identical", other, DAT, rarely, needs, maintenance.,  The, variations, of, how, each, deck, handles, tape, within, the, tape, path, (with, high, tension,, normal, tension,, or, too, little, tension,, etc.), will, vary, with, the, R-DAT, head's, ability, to, write-read, the, tape,, normally, or, excessive, wear, of, tape,, self-clean, or, accumulate, clogging, tape, debris,, and, either, graceful/even, head, wear, without, clogging, or, increasingly, misshapen, the, R-DAT, heads, with, use,, displaying, frequently, clogging, during, the, process., The, question, still, remains;, are, abrasive, tapes, good, for, your, DAT, machine?,  Answer:,  Maybe,, sometimes,, and, yes, occasionally;, depending, on, the, deck., The, Dry-Abrasive, type, cleaning, tapes, are, somewhat, thicker, and, less, flexible, than, normal, tape, and, as, such,, will, wear, the, R-DAT, heads, differently, than, what's, occurring, with, normal, tapes.,  This, may, be, a, benefit, for, those, decks, that, excessively, accumulate, clogs, due, to, a, misshapen, head, that's, in, need, of, re-polishing, to, a, different, and, perhaps, better, shape.,  However,, it, still, needs, to, be, determined, if, the, abrasive, cleaning, tape, is, making, the, R-DAT, head, shape, better, or, worse;, careful, evaluation, of, the, frequency, of, clogs, after, 'polishing', is, all-important., WET-DRY, CLEANING, TAPES,  (Back, to, Cleaning, Tape, Types), Like, cleaning, accessories, for, VCR's,, the, wet-dry, cleaning, tape, consists, of, a, fabric, tape, with, or, without, access, holes, in, the, cassette, shell, for, adding, drops, of, cleaning, fluid., When, cleaning, fluid, (usually, pure, alcohol/Freon), is, applied,, sections, of, the, fabric, tape, are, "wet", with, other, sections, left, dry., When, the, tape, is, "played",, the, entire, tape, path, and, the, rotating, heads, receive, alternate, solvent, cleaning, and, dry, scrubbing, action., The, wet-dry, type, tapes, seem, quite, capable, of, thorough, DAT, cleaning, but,, the, deck, must, be, left, to, "dry-out", before, regular, operation.,  Some, opponents, to, this, type, argue, that, any, kind, of, evaporating, solvent, fluid, especially, Freon, always, causes, water, vapor, moisture, to, condense, inside, the, deck.,  Pure, condensed, (distilled), water, is, harmless, and, will, dry-out, without, consequence, unless, salt, deposits, (perhaps, left, from, an, excursion, to, a, windy, coastal, beach, or, someone's, fingerprint), are, also, present, inside, the, deck.,  Corrosion, to, delicate, heads,, to, the, many, highly, polished, transport, components, (and, to, PCB, connectors), occur, if, salt, residues, get, water-wet, and, stay, moist, for, just, a, short, period, of, time., Quickly, drying, the, deck's, inside, with, a, hair, dryer, does, help, prevent, this, and, may, be, necessary, depending, on, the, use/maintenance, history, of, a, particular, deck., Proponents, of, dry, cleaning, tapes, argue, that, any, moisture, in, the, cleaning, process, is, not, worth, the, risks, of, transport, corrosion, and, that, dry, cleaning, tapes, do, a, much, safer, job, of, deck, maintenance.,  , NON-ABRASIVE, DRY, FABRIC, TAPE, (Back, to, Cleaning, Tape, Types), The, last, cleaning, tape, type, is, made, of, a, fabric, that, grabs, dirt, particles, from, the, entire, tape, path, while, scrub-cleaning, the, R-DAT, heads.,  The, dry, fabric, is, just, as, effective, in, maintaining, decks, against, clogging, and, as, just, about, as, effective, as, both, abrasive, and, wet-dry, types, in, removing, clogs;, depending, on, the, nature, of, what's, actually, doing, the, clogging., If, the, clog's, cause, is, a, thick, film, coating, (or, label, adhesive), on, the, front, surface, of, the, head,, the, wet-dry, fabric, cleaning, tape, might, have, a, better, chance, of, altern
