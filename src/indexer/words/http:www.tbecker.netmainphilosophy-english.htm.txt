PRINTS, BIOGRAPHY, PHILOSOPHY, INTERVIEWS, NEWS, CONTACT, THOMAS, LINKS, PRIVACY, SOME, BYTES, OF, MY, PHILOSOPHY,, ABOUT, MUSIC, Short, text, in, philosophy, of, music,, by, Thomas, Becker, Updated/modified, on, 29, April, 2008, (initially, published, in, April, 2003), Some, small, corrections, on, 1, May, 2008, Both, the, english, and, italian, versions, are, up-to-date, IN, SHORT, What, we, define, as, music, is, a, mental, content, generated, by, the, ears, and, the, brain,, responding, to, certain, stimuli,, both, external, and, internal., In, particular, the, stimuli, external, to, the, minds, (of, the, listeners, and, musicians), are, of, vibrational, kind, (vibrating, air, and, musical, instruments,, which, move, the, auditory, system),, and, are, useful, for, the, communication, of, musical, content,, but, are, substantially, different, from, it, (in, other, words,, music, is, inside, us,, not, outside)., Being, each, individual, unique,, cerebrally, and, psychologically,, each, one, has, its, own, particular, way, to, respond, to, the, external, and, internal, stimuli,, having, thus, a, more, or, less, different, experience, from, the, listening, of, a, same, musical, material., It's, not, possible, to, express, objective, and, absolute, judgements, about, a, tune,, not, existing, a, reference, version, of, it;, in, a, way, there, are, as, many, versions, as, there, are, listeners, (musicians, included)., PART, 1, -, INSIDE, AND, OUTSIDE, I, think, that, what, we, call, music,, and, its, beauty, (or, ugliness),, exist, only, in, the, subjectivity, (this, means, in, the, minds), of, the, listeners, and, of, the, musicians, (which, are, listeners, themselves,, also, during, composition, and, performance)., In, my, opinion,, the, "sonic", vibrations, external, to, us, (e.g., those, caused, by, an, orchestra),, being, only, air, (or, other, material), in, movement,, don't, have, anything, in, common, essentially, with, the, sounds, we, hear, in, our, subjectivity,, which, we, define, as, "music"., Music, is, in, my, opinion, generated, by, the, brain, from, external, and, internal, stimuli,, and, since, aesthetic, sensations, are, in, my, opinion, based, on, our, mental, musical, content, (so, not, on, the, stimuli, which, cause, it,, which, are, more, distant),, I, think, that, also, beauty, (or, ugliness), is, inside, our, mind, and, not, outside., The, fact, that, when, listening, to, music, one, has, the, impression, that, the, sounds, are, outside, of, us, (except, sometimes, when, using, headphones),, is, in, my, opinion, a, kind, of, mental, illusion., I'll, make, a, parallelism, to, try, to, clarify, my, idea:, let's, think, about, a, cinema, screen;, it's, a, flat, surface,, but, when, watching, a, film, projection, one, has, an, impression, of, depth, (pseudo-three-dimensionality),, as, if, there, would, be, something, beyond, (behind), the, screen., But, we, see, only, the, flat, screen., In, a, similar, way,, changing, point, of, view,, I, think, that, we, see, images, (and, hear, sounds),, perceiving, them, as, if, we, would, see, (and, hear), them, directly, outside, of, us, (in, a, three-dimensional, space),, while, in, reality, we, are, observing, (and, listening), only, contents, of, our, mind, (the, screen)., This, contents, are, indeed, caused, by, external, (but, also, internal), stimuli,, which, are, in, the, outer, environment,, but, don't, reflect, it, exactly, (as, in, this, case, the, sounds, which, we, hear, internally,, which, are, simple, matter, in, vibration, outside, the, minds, of, the, listeners, and, musicians)., This, kind, of, illusion, cannot, in, my, opinion, be, avoided,, because, it, depends, on, the, profound, functioning, of, our, brain,, but, one, can, be, aware, of, it., PART, 2, -, WE, ARE, ALL, DIFFERENT,, BUT, SIMILAR, I, think, furthermore, that, each, music, piece, gives, rise, to, different, sensations, in, each, listener, (musicians, included),, and, in, each, listener, at, different, listens,, and, thus, that, each, individual, has, his, own, particular, (and, changing), aesthetic, sense., With, "aesthetic, sense", I, mean, the, way, to, perceive, something, as, "nice", or, "ugly",, in, varying, degrees., To, make, a, parallelism,, I, intend, it, a, bit, like, the, sense, of, taste,, which, can, give, perception, of, something, as, "good", or, "bad",, also, here, in, varying, degrees., To, be, different, I, think, is, not, only, the, aesthetic, sense,, but, also, the, various, impressions, that, one, has, of, the, various, elements, of, a, tune,, impressions, which, I, don't, consider, to, be, necessarily, bound, to, a, nice-ugly, binomial., Why, do, I, believe, this?, My, ideas, were, perhaps, born, empirically, (i.e., through, experience):, I, hear, expressing,, from, different, persons,, comments, (on, aesthetics, and, on, own, listening, impressions), about, a, single, tune, which, can, be, very, different., I, have, moreover, experimented, on, myself, (getting, later, response, also, from, other, persons),, that, the, way, of, perceiving, a, single, tune,, by, a, single, person,, varies, over, time., If, the, aesthetic, sensations, (as, explained, above), and, the, impressions, (for, the, same, reason), don't, refer, directly, to, something, external, to, the, listeners, and, musicians, (air, and, instruments, in, vibration,, which, are, nonetheless, useful, by, serving, the, musician, to, communicate,, to, evoke),, but, refer, directly, to, their, mental, content,, this, indicates, to, me, that, the, way, of, perceiving, a, tune, depends, on, the, biological, structures, (and, if, you, want, also, the, psychological, and, spiritual, structures), of, the, listener, and, the, musician, (ears,, brain,, etc.),, in, their, configuration, at, the, moment, of, listening, (or, composition,, or, performance),, which, create, that, mental, content, (responding, to, external, and, internal, stimuli)., I, think,, I, believe, you'll, agree, from, your, experience,, that, sometimes, also, the, environment, (perceived, at, a, visual, level,, temperature, level,, social, level,, etc.), in, which, the, listening, takes, place,, has, a, certain, influence, on, the, listening., But, also, here, I, think, that, the, biological, and, psychological, structure, of, the, listener, (or, musician), enters, into, play,, which, creates, the, mental, representations, of, the, environment, (and, the, sensations, bound, to, it),, responding, to, the, external, stimuli, (visual,, social,, etc.),, influencing, in, turn, also, the, musical, perception., Excluding, chance,, which, in, addition, to, not, knowing, if, it, exists,, I, believe, would, make, the, listening, chaotic,, something, which, seems, not, to, happen, to, me, (and, anyway, I, think, it, wouldn't, deny, my, discourse,, having, chance, probably, a, scarce, importance, in, this, case),, I, think, that, the, human, biological, and, psychological, structure,, and, the, listening, environment,, are, the, determining, factors, in, musical, perception, (if, you, know, others,, please, let, me, know)., My, idea, that, each, individual, has, its, own, particular, way, of, perceiving, music,, I, think, I, can, demonstrate, it, like, this:, being, several, persons, at, the, same, time, and, place, listening, to, music,, it, can, happen, that, some, of, them, have, very, different, listening, experiences, (judging, from, their, comments, and, reactions)., Being, their, objective, listening, environment, very, similar,, this, can't, in, my, opinion, justify, this, discrepancies., I, explain, this, difference, determined, for, the, major, part, by, a, diversity, of, biological, and, psychological, structure, (the, only, factors, remaining),, which, determines, their, aesthetic, sense, and, the, impressions, which, they, have, of, a, tune,, making, different, for, this, listeners, the, way, to, perceive, music, (and, the, environment)., Thus,, generalizing,, it, is, in, my, opinion, very, improbable, that, two, or, more, persons, can, have, identical, listening, experiences, of, a, tune,, being, very, improbable, the, existence, of, two, identical, human, beings, (even, only, in, the, structures, interested, by, the, musical, listening),, even, at, different, moments, (I, exclude, also, twins,, which, can, be, very, similar, in, appearance,, but, which, are, in, my, opinion, however, cerebrally, and, psychologically, different,, having, lived, different, experiences)., I, think, that, also, for, a, single, individual, it, is, very, improbable, to, have, identical, listening, experiences, --, in, different, moments, --, of, a, single, tune,, being, he, subject, (I, think, you'll, agree), to, continuous, changes,, and, he, is, never, the, same, as, he, has, been, in, the, past, (and, I, think, that, also, the, most, "little", experiences, can, modify, something, cerebrally,, maybe, often, of, little, importance,, but, however, in, my, opinion, enough, to, make, my, reasoning, valid)., Thus,, when, two, persons, discuss, about, the, value, of, a, tune,, I, think, they, are, (in, a, way), speaking, of, two, different, "tunes", (intended, each, one, as, a, succession, of, sonic, mental, perceptions, delimited, in, time),, as, each, of, them, has, perceived, them., I, think, that, after, having, written, a, piece,, if, it, gets, listened, by, 50, persons,, in, a, way, I, have, caused, the, generation, of, 50, different, tunes., This, means, also, that, for, a, musician, (composer, and/or, performer), it, is, practically, impossible, to, transmit, his, music, to, his, listeners, exactly, as, he, hears, it, himself., It's, also, true, though,, I, believe, it, from, my, experiences, (of, listening,, and, confrontation, with, other, persons),, that, between, different, listeners, (musicians, included), there, can, be, similarities, in, their, aestheric, sense, and, listening, impressions, --, yes,, we, are, all, different,, but, from, another, point, of, view, we, are, all, humans, --, thus, a, tune, can, touch, them, similarly, in, certain, aspects., Thus,, when, I, compose,, I, compose, according, to, my, taste,, but, have, the, hope, to, find, people, who, are, near, me, musically., I, personally, think, that, when, the, major, part, of, the, people,, or, even, all, of, them,, judge, something, (e.g., from, an, aesthetic, point, of, view), in, the, same, way,, it, is, not, suitable, to, use, the, term, "objective"., I, rather, prefer, to, use, the, term, "shared"., For, example,, if, a, tune, is, liked, by, everybody, (or, better, said,, everyone, gets, pleasure, from, the, musical, perception, caused, by, certain, groups, of, external, vibrational, stimuli),, I, wouldn't, say, that, it, is, objectively, nice,, for, the, reasons, which, I, have, exposed, in, this, present, text,, but, would, rather, say, that, all, the, listeners, share, a, same, positive, sensation/impression, of, it, (or, better, said,, they, all, share, a, positive, response, to, those, vibrational, stimuli)., I, specify, that, with, objective, I, mean, "related, to, the, object,, intrinsic, and, concrete, characteristic, of, it"., While, with, subjective, I, mean, "related, to, the, conscious, mind,, present, inside, the, mind, and, not, outside", (this, are, my, definitions)., I, personally, consider, to, be, objective, also, that, which, is, subjective, perception,, so, namely, content, of, our, mind., That, because, our, sensations,, emotions,, etc.,, are, in, my, opinion, concretely, present, in, our, mind,, and, we, make, direct, experience, of, them., I'll, make, an, example, to, clarify, (this, apparently, strange, idea):, the, sensation, of, warmness, is, present, only, mentally,, thus, it, is, subjective,, but, it, is, an, intrinsic, and, concrete, characteristic, of, that, mental, content,, of, which, we, have, direct, experience,, thus, it, is, objective, at, the, same, time., I, usually, take, into, consideration, in, the, same, way, the, point, of, view, of, each, one, (except, in, the, case, of, technically, experts,, who, know, when, a, tune, "works", or, not,, or, also, if, it, has, problems, at, compositional, or, sonic, level),, because, I, don't, believe, that, there's, the, one, who, is, able, to, listen, better;, I, believe, that, each, one, listens, to, what, his, (unique, and, particular), brain, proposes,, and, there, is, no, objective, beauty, or, ugliness,, that, could, be, picked,, out, of, the, minds., I, think, that, if, somebody, likes, something,, in, his, subjectivity,, it, is, nonsense, to, tell, him, that, in, some, way, he, is, wrong, in, taking, pleasure, from, it, --, or, vice, versa., I, add, some, curiosities, regarding, aesthetic, sense,, which, I, discovered, and, which, other, persons, have, confirmed,, and, which, you, perhaps, didn't, notice, (like, me, before):, often,, when, listening, to, a, tune, for, the, first, times,, it, doesn't, tell, me, much;, let's, say, it, can, seem, "flat", and, little, interesting, to, me., At, subsequent, listens, I, begin, to, like, it,, and, I, can, even, like, it, a, lot., Sometimes, it, happens, that, I, like, a, tune,, and, then, discover, that, I, had, already, listened, to, it,, a, fact, that, I, didn't, notice, during, that, last, listen, (perhaps, I, had, listened, to, it, long, time, before,, but, this, happened, also, in, a, matter, of, a, few, days)., It, seems, to, me, thus, that, repeated, listens, of, a, tune, can, make, us, like, it,, perhaps, mostly, melodically., I'm, not, saying, this, is, an, absolute, rule,, but, this, happens, to, me, (at, least, currently), often., Then,, maybe,, judging, from, the, vague, remembrances, of, listening, experiences, which, I, have, from, my, own, infancy, (but, I'm, far, from, certain),, this, could, be, different, for, children;, it, could, be, that, a, child,, listening, to, an, unknown, tune,, could, find, it, nice, and, stirring, already, from, the, first, listen,, if, this, contains, some, musical, elements, which, are, a, novelty, for, him,, and, thus, impress, him, particularly., PART, 3, -, QUALITY, I, sometimes, hear, people, replying, to, my, ideas, exposed, here, above,, that, if, the, beauty, of, a, tune, is, subjective,, there's, still, its, quality, to, take, in, consideration,, which, should, be, something, objective,, intrinsic, of, a, given, music, (if, my, interpretation, of, this, idea, is, correct)., I, refer, to, the, definitions, of, "objective", and, "subjective", of, which, I, write, above., With, "quality", --, seems, to, me, --, are, usually, intended, such, things, as, (remaining, in, the, music, field), a, good, touch,, a, good, expressivity,, a, good, sound,, a, good, technique,, complexity,, depth,, and, perhaps, more., I, think,, first, of, all,, that, the, discourse, from, before, is, valid, here,, too,, namely, that, what, we, perceive, and, call, music, is, a, mental, content,, and, consequently, also, quality, should, be,, as, it, refers, directly, to, that, mental, content., But, in, my, opinion,, quality, is, not, only, confined, in, the, minds,, but, it, is, neither, a, real, perception., In, my, opinion,, it, is, nothing, more, than, an, abstract, concept, to, define, the, presence, of, certain, aesthetic, sensations, (at, least, in, the, case, of, music)., I, think, in, fact,, that, something, which, gets, judged, as, being, of, "good, quality",, is, judged, this, way, because, it, is, liked, under, certain, aspects., To, indicate, touch,, expressivity,, sound,, technique, (etc.), as, being, of, "good, quality",, means, in, my, opinion, that, there's, something, about, this, categories,, or, to, their, effects,, which, is, liked, (it, is, nice,, at, least, for, who, affirms, it),, or, vice, versa., For, example,, I, think, that, saying, that, a, guitarist, has, a, good, touch, for, vibrato,, doesn't, mean, that, his, vibrato, has, such, a, thing, as, "good, quality", in, itself, (where, should, it, be, located?),, or, in, the, perception, which, I, have, of, it,, but, rather, that, I, like, the, sound, which, is, caused, by, his, touch., If, we, wouldn't, like, the, sound,, we, wouldn't, say, that, he, has, a, good, vibrato,, I, think., It, seems, to, me,, thus,, that, the, concept, of, quality, (at, least, in, music), is, to, lead, back, to, aesthetic, sensations, (and, consequently, to, the, first, part, of, my, discourse)., There's, anyhow, to, add, that, perhaps, the, concept, of, quality, is, less, affected, by, differences, in, judgement, bound, to, aesthetic, sense., If, a, musical, piece,, in, his, whole,, can, easily, be, liked, or, disliked, depending, on, the, tastes, of, the, listeners,, the, judgements, about, his, quality, (subjective, as, explained, above), perhaps, are, more, easily, shared., Thus, --, for, example, --, an, high-level, production,, of, an, important, band,, will, be, hardly, perceived, as, of, low, level, from, a, sonic, point, of, view., Or, oppositely,, a, dissonant, recording, with, un-tuned, instruments,, will, be, hardly, perceived, as, pleasant., Some, words, in, particular, for, the, concept, of, "complexity",, with, a, question, to, pose, to, oneself:, when, does, complexity, begin,, and, when, does, simplicity?, My, answer, is, that,, missing, an, objective, border,, both, categories, come, to, fall., These, can, be, anyhow, useful, to, communicate, in, the, everyday, life,, with, the, awareness, that, it's, the, case, of, subjective, and, relative, human, concepts,, in, a, way, invented., Furthermore,, and, I, think, that, this, counts, also, for, other, concepts, (e.g., for, those, of, originality, and, traditionality),, I, believe, that, it, is, no, absolute, rule, that, complexity, (as, subjective, concept), is, better, than, simplicity, (still, as, subjective, concept)., In, my, opinion, it, is, a, matter, of, culture, and, personal, preferences., It's, arbitrary, to, prefer, the, one, or, the, other., CONCLUSION, The, central, idea, ot, this, writing, of, mine, (which, initially, moved, me, to, do, it), is, the, surpassing, of, the, illusion, in, attributing, elements, which, are, solely, mental,, to, the, external, environment., The, sounds, of, which, I, speak, in, this, writing,, but, also, the, colours,, the, tastes,, the, smells,, the, pains,, and, other, concepts, like, big, and, small,, tall, and, short,, good, and, bad,, complex, and, simple,, warm, and, cold,, and, so, on,, are, in, my, opinion, present, only, mentally,, some, as, sensations, of, which, we, have, direct, experience,, and, some, others, as, concepts, which, are, abstract,, subjective, and, relative., As, conscious, beings,, we, are, in, direct, contact, with, our, consciousness,, where, perceptions, of, different, kinds, "arise"., Since, our, consciousness, has, the, characteristic, of, displaying, the, sensorial, perceptions, in, a, three-dimensional, space,, it's, perhaps, for, this, reason, that, it, seems, --, illusionary, --, obvious, that, what, we, perceive, sensorially, is, outside, of, us, exactly, as, it, appears, to, us., Probably, it, is, not, possible, and, neither, necessary, to, avoid, this, illusion,, not, necessary, because, it, anyway, seems, functional,, but, perhaps, it's, a, good, thing, to, be, aware, of, it.,  , If, you, have, objections,, suggestions,, comments,, questions,, or, something, is, not, clear,, please, write, to, me., Thanks, for, the, particularly, useful, feedback,
