some, good, folks,, who'd, like, to, see, that, number, drop, to, zero,, posed, the, 22, Pushup, challenge, to, raise, awareness, of, the, problem, (often, the, first, step, in, solving, a, problem)., So,, I'm, doing, my, part, in, hopes, that, awareness, will, lead, to, help, getting, to, the, folks, that, need, it., Or, dare, I, dream,, perhaps, some, troubled, vets, will, find, encouragement, surfing, the, internet, watching, all, of, us, regular, folks, doing, pushups., Anyway,, I, first, stumbled, across, Chris, Evans, (Captain, America), doing, this, on, Youtube, and, got, inspired, to, do, my, part, as, well., I'm, no, superhero,, so, I, had, to, break, my, 22, into, two, sets, of, 11., I, think, the, vets, will, understand, if, you, have, to, break, yours, into, smaller, sets.,

every, flush, -, 1.28, gallons, in, our, toilets, to, be, exact, (which, is, already, considered, frugal)., But,, dual, flush, toilets, aren't, expensive, at, all,, and, dual-flush, replacement, kits, are, an, option., I, researched, them,, but, went, nuts, instead., I, bought, a, new, flapper, (5, bucks), and, 3, stainless, steel, nuts, (a, buck, fifty), -, which, I, strung, on, the, chain, to, weigh, down, the, flapper., Now, to, flush, #1,, I, push, the, handle, down, assertively,, hold, for, a, quick, beat, and, let, go., Only, �, the, water, in, the, tank, rushes, out, (.6, gallons?),
