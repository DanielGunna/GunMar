much, respect., Do, they, deserve, it?, Laura, Miller, Follow, Skip, to, Comments, Topics:, Books,, Entertainment, News, “A, screenwriter, is, not, really, a, writer;, his, words, do, not, appear, on, the, screen., What, he, does, is, to, draft, out, blueprints, that, are, executed, by, a, team.”, So, wrote, Paul, Schrader,, writer, of, “Taxi, Driver”, and, co-writer, of, “Raging, Bull,”, two, of, the, greatest, films, of, the, late, 1970s, —, though, chances, are, you, were, only, dimly, aware, of, that,, and, think, of, them, both, as, Martin, Scorsese, pictures., That, the, writer, on, any, film, project, is, regarded, as, a, second-class, talent,, negligible, at, best, and, a, nuisance, at, worst,, is, one, of, the, hoariest, chestnuts, of, the, movie, industry,, and, even, the, writers, themselves, can’t, seem, to, help, polishing, it, every, now, and, then., So, Marc, Norman, —, a, screenwriter, himself,, winner, of, an, Academy, Award, for, “Shakespeare, in, Love”, —, abundantly, documents, in, his, new, book,, “What, Happens, Next:, A, History, of, American, Screenwriting.”, Last, week,, American, screenwriters, (for, television, as, well, as, film), overwhelmingly, voted, to, authorize, a, strike,, their, first, in, nearly, 20, years,, if, their, union,, the, Writers, Guild, of, America,, can’t, agree, to, a, new, contract, with, the, Alliance, of, Motion, Picture, and, Television, Producers., Rather, than, settling, cutting-edge, issues, like, Internet, and, cellphone, rights,, they, are, going, to, the, mat, over, several, long-standing, quarrels, left, over, from, a, previous, contract,, most, surprisingly, (to, some), the, payment, of, residuals,, royalties, dispensed, to, writers, whenever, their, work, is, resold, in, another, format, —, cable,, home, video, and, other, technologies., According, to, reports,, it, came, up, again, as, part, of, an, elaborate, dance, of, feints, and, parries, typical, to, labor, negotiations,, but, it, testifies, to, the, way, that,, for, writers, in, Hollywood,, resentment, never, dies;, there’s, always, another, kick, coming, along, to, revive, it., Why, should, this, be?, A, good, script, seems, an, essential, ingredient, of, a, good, movie,, and, what, director, in, his, right, mind, would, start, filming, without, one?, D.W., Griffith,, for, one., Norman, launches, his, book, with, a, description, of, the, making,, in, 1914,, of, “The, Birth, of, a, Nation,”, an, ideologically, dubious,, decidedly, racist, but, nevertheless, seminal, picture, that, was, apparently, shot, without, a, screenplay., Of, course,, there, had, already, been, a, play,, based, on, a, novel,, “The, Klansman,”, that, Griffith, knew, well., (He’d, acted, in, the, play.), But, the, tendency, of, a, mere, stack, of, paper, to, seem, irrelevant, once, you, have, cameras, rolling,, horses, galloping, and, girls, screaming, for, help, was, established, at, the, very, beginning., The, long,, sad, saga, of, mistreatment, at, the, hands, of, ruthless, moguls, and, Napoleonic, directors, unfolds, from, there., Mack, Sennett,, director, of, the, Keystone, Kops, and, other, classic, silent, comedies,, kept, a, team, of, writers, working, in, his, “Gag, Room”, in, cell-like, conditions,, without, telephones, or, newspapers,, and, forbade, them, to, eat, anything, beside, a, tuna, sandwich, and, milk, for, lunch, because, “eating, heavy, stuff, makes, writers, logy.”, Jack, Warner,, of, Warner, Brothers, Studios,, called, his, staff, writers, “schmucks, with, Underwoods”, and, used, to, sneak, over, to, their, building, to, check, that, the, typewriters, were, going., The, infamously, nasty, Harry, Cohn, of, Columbia, Pictures, did, the, same, thing,, and, when, he, heard, the, clacking, of, keys, as, he, passed, the, window,, would, scream,, “Liars!”, Norman, attributes, some, of, this, animosity, to, the, essential, mystery, of, the, writing, process., To, the, tough,, practical,, working-class, men, who, founded, the, movie, industry,, it, looked, suspiciously, like, loafing., “None, of, them, were, quite, sure, what, a, screenwriter, did,”, he, writes,, “or, even, how, he, did, it., Certainly, he, or, she, delivered, an, artifact,, a, screenplay,, that, worked, or, didn’t,, but, where, did, it, come, from?, …, Did, it, take, them, a, year, to, write, a, screenplay,, or, only, one, day, and, then, they, waited, a, year, to, hand, it, in?, There, was, no, telling, because, nobody, could, see, the, work, occur.”, That’s, the, thing, about, any, kind, of, writing:, It, may, be, difficult,, but, it, sure, looks, easy, —, you, can, do, it, in, your, pj’s!, Until, the, advent, of, reality, TV, talent, shows, like, “American, Idol,”, most, of, us, existed, in, blissful, ignorance, of, the, sheer, number, of, completely, untalented, people, who, remain, convinced, that, they, are, destined, for, stardom., But, consider, this:, Although, practically, anyone, can, instantly, recognize, tone-deafness, when, they, hear, it,, in, a, world, where, fewer, and, fewer, people, read, at, all,, bad, writers, can, go, on, believing, in, their, (unappreciated), genius, indefinitely., People, realistic, enough, to, recognize, they’re, not, cut, out, to, be, actors, or, directors, can, nonetheless, persuade, themselves, —, after, reading, a, manual, or, two, or, by, taking, one, of, Robert, McKee’s, famous, “story, seminars”, —, that, they, can, write., In, recent, decades,, as, Norman, observes,, this, has, led, to, jokes, about, “how, everybody, in, Los, Angeles, was, busy, writing, something;, industry, professionals, were, constantly, having, manuscripts, thrust, at, them, by, hairdressers,, by, pool, men,, by, their, shrinks.”, And, why, not,, when, an, editor, and, art, director, from, Esquire, magazine, seemingly, pulled, the, original, screenplay, for, “Bonnie, and, Clyde”, out, of, nowhere, in, 1965,, launching, two, brilliant,, glamorous,, lucrative, careers?, Screenwriters, have, it, worst, of, all, because, (and, Norman, really, only, grazes, this, point), writing, is, invisible, and, internal, and, movies, are, all, about, —, really, only, about, —, what, you, can, see., The, movies, need, writers,, and, are, intermittently, struck, with, the, desire, to, celebrate, and, enrich, this, one, or, that, one,, but, can, never, entirely, trust, them,, and, vice, versa., The, movies, and, writing, transpire, in, fundamentally, different, worlds., Norman, winds, up, his, book, with, a, paean, to, the, screenwriter’s, privilege, in, getting, “to, see, the, movie,, first,, entire,, in, their, minds,”, but, the, whole, point, of, a, movie, is, that, it’s, not, in, your, mind, —, it’s, right, in, front, of, your, face,, 15, feet, high., Otherwise,, it’s, a, radio, play,, maybe., Or, a, novel., Even, getting, a, fix, on, how, screenplays, have, been, created, over, the, years, seems, to, be, next, to, impossible,, which, may, explain, why, “What, Happens, Next”, is, not, so, much, a, history, of, American, screenwriting, as, it, is, a, history, of, American, screenwriters., Norman, gives, us, the, very, earliest, scenarists, —, newspaper, caption, writers,, “trained, in, writing, snappy, stuff”, and, thrilled, to, be, making, four, times, their, old, salaries,, and, a, surprising, number, of, women., Gene, Gauntier,, the, leading, actress, for, one, of, the, early,, tiny,, East, Coast, film, companies,, wound, up, writing, its, adaptation, of, “Tom, Sawyer,”, probably, because, she, was, the, only, one, who’d, actually, read, the, book, (or,, you, get, the, impression,, any, book, at, all)., She, not, only, did, all, her, own, stunts, (horseback, riding,, rope, climbing,, roof, jumping),, she, thought, them, up,, too., Once, the, industry, really, got, up, and, running, in, Hollywood, —, where, many, would-be, producers, fled, to, escape, the, goons, Thomas, Edison, hired, to, enforce, the, patents, he, was, too, short-sighted, to, secure, legitimately, —, they, began, to, toy, with, the, idea, of, hiring, real, writers., Samuel, Goldwyn, imported, a, passel, of, bestselling, novelists, to, write, screenplays, in, 1919,, for, a, spinoff, company, he, called, “Eminent, Authors”;, the, results, were, disappointing., In, the, 1920s, and, ’30s,, gushers, of, Hollywood, money, wooed, novelists, like, F., Scott, Fitzgerald, and, William, Faulkner, westward,, along, with, those, writers, of, less, definitive, talent, who, clustered, around, the, Algonquin, Round, Table:, Dorothy, Parker,, Robert, Benchley,, George, S., Kaufman., All, of, these, people, looked, down, on, the, industry., Stephen, Vincent, Benet, wrote, to, a, friend,, “Of, all, the, Christ, bitten, places, and, businesses, in, the, two, hemispheres, this, one, is, the, last, curly, kink, on, the, pig’s, tail.”, How, much, was, snobbery, and, how, much, a, legitimate, response, to, the, writer’s, low, status, on, the, Hollywood, totem, pole?, This, is, hard, to, determine,, though, Norman, tries., He, points, to, a, much, publicized, telegram, that, Herman, Mankiewicz, sent, to, his, journalist, friend, Ben, Hecht,, urging, him, to, come, west, to, partake, of, the, gravy, train:, “millions, are, to, be, grabbed, out, here, and, your, only, competition, is, idiots.”, Hecht,, when, he, arrived,, was, even, more, scathing,, between, writing, seemingly, hundreds, of, terrific, films,, often, uncredited,, from, “Scarface”, (the, original, 1932, version), to, “His, Girl, Friday.”, “The, movies,”, Hecht, announced,, “are, an, eruption, of, trash, that, has, lamed, the, American, mind, and, retarded, Americans, from, becoming, cultured, people.”, As, tough, as, the, moguls, were,, they, didn’t, much, appreciate, being, sneered, at, by, scribblers, who, were, not, too, high, and, mighty, to, cash, their, checks., They,, in, turn,, treated, writers, like, assembly-line, workers,, randomly, pulling, them, off, one, job, and, assigning, them, to, another,, demanding, strict, adherence, to, all, the, dopey, conventions, of, mass, entertainment,, capriciously, imposing, drastic, changes, and, rewrites,, and, “following”, —, that, is,, covertly, assigning, more, than, one, writer, (or, team, of, writers), to, the, same, project, and, assembling, the, final, screenplay, via, a, mix-and-match, process., Most, of, the, copious, product, the, studios, churned, out, in, the, years, before, television, originated, in, studio, “story, conferences,”, not, with, the, writers, themselves,, and, the, results, were, work, for, hire;, the, studio, owned, it, all., Oh,, and, one, more, thing:, Writers, routinely, went, uncredited, on, screenplays, that, they, substantively, wrote,, while, people, who, did, nothing,, or, next, to, it,, got, their, names, on, the, screen,, and, sometimes, even, the, Oscar, nominations., Disrespect, was, mutual,, as, Norman, follows, Hollywood’s, writerly, community, through, the, radical, 1930s,, when, the, Communist, Party, was, all, the, rage,, to, the, war, years,, when, everyone, enjoyed, a, rare, moment, of, unity, and, common, purpose., Labor, unions, seemed, to, promise, better, working, conditions, and, the, beginning, of, some, intellectual, property, rights,, but, this, was, mostly, squelched, after, the, war,, with, the, trauma, of, the, blacklist., Besides,, various, economic, pressures, —, from, tax, laws, to, antitrust, suits, —, eroded, the, studio, system,, and, soon, everyone, would, be, a, freelancer,, with, all, the, liberty, and, anxiety, that, entailed., As, he, goes, along,, Norman, picks, representative, writers, from, each, period:, forgotten, troupers, like, Gauntier, and, shameless, con, artists, like, Hecht, and, his, longtime, writing, partner, Charles, MacArthur,, who, once, tricked, a, producer, into, hiring, a, “writer”, who, was, really, a, gas, station, attendant, with, an, English, accent., (MacArthur, wanted, to, find, out, how, little, a, contract, writer, could, produce, without, getting, fired.), Billy, Wilder, and, Preston, Sturges, demonstrate, the, emergence, of, the, writer-director,, a, difficult, job,, but, one, that, guaranteed, you’d, get, your, movie,, as, you, intended, it, to, be,, in, the, can., Then, there, are, the, tortured, prestige, hires, like, Fitzgerald, and, Faulkner, —, the, first, trying, and, failing,, pitifully,, to, succeed, as, a, screenwriter,, the, latter, wanting, little, more, than, to, be, left, in, peace, to, drink., Dalton, Trumbo, is, the, quintessential, blacklisted, writer,, of, course,, inching, his, way, back, into, the, industry, after, relocating, to, Mexico,, and, churning, out, bales, of, scripts, at, a, fraction, of, his, previous, fee,, under, assumed, names, and, behind, fronts., The, ferociously, uncompromising, Paddy, Chayefsky, got, started, writing, one-acts, for, the, Philco, Television, Playhouse, in, the, 1950s,, and, insisted, on, being, given, the, same, level, of, creative, control, when, he, moved, on, to, film, in, the, 1960s., He, rarely, achieved, that,, but, set, a, standard, for, writerly, integrity, until, he, made, the, mistake, of, approving, the, kitsch, maestro, Ken, Russell, to, direct, what, should, have, been, his, magnum, opus,, “Altered, States.”, Things, really, fell, apart, when, the, writer, and, director, disagreed, over, the, size, of, one, of, the, film’s, props, (an, isolation, tank),, and, Chayefsky, stormed, onto, the, set, with, a, chain, saw, to, lop, off, the, offending, part., Legally, obligated, to, film, Chayefsky’s, dialogue, as, written,, Russell, ordered, the, actors, to, recite, it, incomprehensibly, fast, or, while, cramming, food, in, their, mouths., Then, come, the, wild, men, of, the, late, 1960s, and, ’70s., Terry, Southern, supplied, hipster, expertise, on, “Dr., Strangelove”, and, “Easy, Rider,”, but, was, too, cool, to, fight, for, the, credit, he, deserved., A, new, generation, —, raised, with, TV, and, the, masterpieces, (and, trash), from, Hollywood’s, past, that, broadcasters, used, to, fill, the, off, hours, —, went, to, new, film, schools, and, soaked, up, Andrew, Sarris’, auteur, theory,, the, one, that, attributes, all, creative, vision, and, distinctive, style, of, a, film, to, its, director., This, cohort, —, Norman, calls, them, the, “film, brats”, —, hijack, the, narrative, for, several, chapters., Francis, Ford, Coppola,, George, Lucas,, Steven, Spielberg,, Paul, Schrader, were,, as, Norman, himself, acknowledges,, really, directors, at, heart., They, initially, wrote, screenplays, in, order, to, break, into, the, business, or, to, wrestle, some, personally, significant, material, onto, the, screen., Then,, they, gave, it, up, for, the, most, part:, “They, were, passionate, about, movies, as, no, other, generation, had, been,, but, not, for, the, writing, of, them,, for, any, sort, of, writing.”, The, closing, notes, that, Norman, sounds, include, Joe, Eszterhas,, a, strutting, blowhard, who, nevertheless, managed,, in, the, slick, 1980s,, to, become, somewhat, famous, among, the, general, public,, a, rare, feat., Norman, describes, him, as, a, “good”, writer,, by, which, I, assume, he, means, “successful,”, since, Eszterhas, (“Basic, Instinct,”, “Showgirls”), never, wrote, a, genuinely, good, film, and, faded, from, view, after, producing, five, flops, in, a, row., Finally,, “What, Happens, Next”, praises, Charlie, Kaufman, (“Being, John, Malkovich,”, “Adaptation”),, the, rare, screenwriter, capable, of, overshadowing, his, directors,, as, an, example, of, a, writer, who, has, incorporated, the, influence, of, postmodernism., (Norman’s, conception, of, this, is, a, bit, muddled,, but, then,, whose, isn’t?), Again,, most, of, this, is, about, screenwriters,, and, the, business, of, writing, for, the, screen,, not, about, the, actual, writing, itself., “What, Happens, Next”, will, tell, you, next, to, nothing, about, how, the, art, of, screenwriting, evolved,, how, the, major, breakthroughs, (if, any), changed, the, form,, what, new, things, writers, tried, or, wanted, to, try, and, why., Perhaps, my, surprise, at, this, betrays, my, literary, bias;, it’s, impossible, to, imagine, a, history, of, the, 20th-century, novel, that, talked, about, Fitzgerald’s, high, jinks, with, Zelda, in, Paris, or, Virginia, Woolf’s, dealings, with, publishers, but, not, about, what, these, writers, actually, wrote, in, any, depth., Norman, does, describe, how, certain, significant, films, —, “Double, Indemnity,”, “Casablanca,”, “Apocalypse,, Now”, —, came, to, be, written,, but, these, descriptions, mostly, consist, of, anecdotes., Billy, Wilder, and, Raymond, Chandler, were, locked, up, in, a, room, at, Paramount,, hating, each, other,, as, the, old-ladyish, Chandler, complained, about, all, the, calls, Wilder, got, from, women, and, insisted, that, he, couldn’t, work, with, “a, man, who, wears, a, hat, in, the, office., I, feel, he, is, about, to, leave, momentarily.”, “Casablanca”, was, thrown, together, higgledy-piggledy,, with, the, exact, ending, only, settled, on, at, the, last, minute,, after, Humphrey, Bogart, objected, that, his, character,, Rick, Blaine,, wouldn’t, shoot, a, man,, not, even, the, evil, Nazi, Strasser,, in, the, back., And, then,, of, course,, there, are, the, (by, now, pretty, shopworn), tales, of, Coppola, facing, the, same, dilemma, while, running, amok, in, the, Philippines, —, until, he, decided, to, pilfer, his, ending, from, the, somewhat, dubious, anthropological, theories, in, Sir, James, George, Frazer’s, “The, Golden, Bough.”, The, lack, of, real, literary, criticism, in, “What, Happens, Next”, is, understandable, in, a, way;, most, of, the, people, who, wrote, these, scripts, weren’t, taking, the, product, very, seriously, as, literature., They, didn’t, record, their, aspirations, and, the, minutiae, of, their, creative, throes,, as, poets, and, novelists, are, wont, to, do., In, fact,, it’s, not, always, easy,, especially, with, studio, films, and, other, multi-writer, projects,, to, detect, who, actually, wrote, what., Even, the, critic, David, Kipen,, whose, persuasive, book-length, essay, “The, Schreiber, Theory”, argues, that, the, screenwriter, is, a, better, determinant, of, a, film’s, quality, than, the, director,, must, mostly, resort, to, listing, the, films, each, writer, worked, on, as, evidence., Norman, could, have, done, more, to, correct, this, situation, —, he, apparently, conducted, no, original, research, although, he, seems, well, placed, to, have, done, so., Instead,, he, derives, most, of, the, material, in, “What, Happens, Next”, from, other, books., It’s, true, that, anecdotes, and, biography, make, better, copy., Norman,, as, a, screenwriter, himself,, is, acutely, sensitive, to, the, fact, that, writers, enter, the, upper, echelons, of, Hollywood, on, sufferance., He, quotes, film, critic, David, Thomson’s, withering, observation, that, to, the, industry’s, elite,, “a, writer, is, like, a, divorce, lawyer, or, a, private, eye:, when, you, want, them, you, have, to, have, them;, but, later, you, despise, them.”, The, writers, who, cling, to, a, place, at, the, table, know, they, can, only, keep, it, by, virtue, of, their, wit, and, charm,, so, as, soon, as, Norman, has, our, attention,, he, turns, raconteur,, spinning, yarns, and, repeating, quips, by, larger-than-life, characters, like, Hecht, and, Wilder., You, want, to, pat, him, on, the, shoulder, and, say,, “Relax,, Marc., You’re, among, your, own, people, now., We, are, the, readers.”, Alas,, to, quote, Norman, paraphrasing, another, industry, proverb, in, this, book,, “Hollywood, is, high, school, with, money.”, The, most, popular, kids, still, appear, as, gods, to, the, mere, rabble., As, with, all, entertainment, industry, insiders,, Norman’s, attention, seems, to, drift, inexorably, in, the, direction, of, magnetic, north:, whoever, has, the, most, power., There’s, more, in, this, overlong,, if, entertaining, book, about, moguls, and, producers, and, directors, than,, strictly, speaking,, there, ought, to, be., These, men, distort, the, gravitation, field, of, the, story, Norman, is, trying, to, tell,, and, he, winds, up, retreading, stories, about, figures, like, Irving, Thalberg, and, Coppola,, people, who,, however, charismatic,, have, already, been, well, sung., Five, hundred, pages, after, we, learn, that, Griffith, made, “The, Birth, of, a, Nation”, without, a, script,, screenwriting,, that, occult, process, by, which, a, script, is, created,, remains, invisible., Laura, Miller, is, a, senior, writer, for, Salon., She, is, the, author, of, "The, Magician's, Book:, A, Skeptic's, Adventures, in, Narnia", and, has, a,
