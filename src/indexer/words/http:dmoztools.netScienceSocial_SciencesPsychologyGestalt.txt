is, a, broadly, interdisciplinary, general, theory, which, provides, a, framework, for, a, wide, variety, of, psychological, phenomena,, processes,, and, applications., Human, beings, are, viewed, as, open, systems, in, active, interaction, with, their, environment., It, is, especially, suited, for, the, understanding, of, order, and, structure, in, psychological, events,, and, has, its, origins, in, some, orientations, of, Johann, Wolfgang, von, Goethe,, Ernst, Mach,, and, particularly, of, Christian, von, Ehrenfels, and, the, research, work, of, Max, Wertheimer,, Wolfgang, Köhler,, Kurt, Koffka,, and, Kurt, Lewin,, who, opposed, the, elementistic, approach, to, psychological, events,, associationism,, behaviorism,, and, to, psychoanalysis., The, coming, to, power, of, national, socialism, substantially, interrupted, the, fruitful, scientific, development, of, Gestalt, theory, in, the, German-speaking, world;, Koffka,, Wertheimer,, Köhler, and, Lewin, emigrated,, or, were, forced, to, flee,, to, the, United, States., Gestalt, theory, is, not, limited, only, to, the, concept, of, the, Gestalt, or, the, whole,, or, to, the, Gestalt, principles, of, the, organization, of, perception, (as, it, is, presented, in, many, publications),, but, must, be, understood, as, essentially, far, broader, and, more, encompassing:, -, The, primacy, of, the, phenomenal:, Recognizing, and, taking, seriously, the, human, world, of, experience, as, the, only, immediately, given, reality,, and, not, simply, discussing, it, away,, is, a, fundamental, assertion, of, Gestalt, theory,, the, fruitfulness, of, which, for, psychology, and, psychotherapy, has, by, no, means, been, exhausted., -, It, is, the, interaction, of, the, individual, and, the, situation, in, the, sense, of, a, dynamic, field, which, determines, experience, and, behavior,, and, not, only, drives, (psychoanalysis,, ethology), or, external, stimuli, (behaviorism,, Skinner), or, static, personality, traits, (classical, personality, theory)., -, Connections, among, psychological, contents, are, more, readily, and, more, permanently, created, on, the, basis, of, substantive, concrete, relationships, than, by, sheer, repetition, and, reinforcement., -, Thinking, and, problem, solving, are, characterized, by, appropriate, substantive, organization,, restructuring,, and, centering, of, the, given, ('insight'), in, the, direction, of, the, desired, solution., -, In, memory,, structures, based, on, associative, connections, are, elaborated, and, differentiated, according, to, a, tendency, for, optimal, organization., -, Cognitions, which, an, individual, cannot, integrate, lead, to, an, experience, of, dissonance, and, to, cognitive, processes, directed, at, reducing, this, dissonance., -, In, a, supra-individual, whole, such, as, a, group,, there, is, a, tendency, toward, specific, relationships, in, the, interaction, of, strengths, and, needs., The, epistemological, orientation, of, Gestalt, theory, tends, to, be, a, kind, of, critical, realism., Methodologically,, the, attempt, is, to, achieve, a, meaningful, integration, of, experimental, and, phenomenological, procedures, (the, experimental-phenomenological, method)., Crucial, phenomena, are, examined, without, reduction, of, experimental, precision., Gestalt, theory, is, to, be, understood, not, as, a, static, scientific, position,, but, as, a, paradigm, that, is, continuing, to, develop., Through, developments, such, as, the, theory, of, the, self-organization, of, systems,, it, attains, major, significance, for, many, of, the, current, concerns, of, psychology., Subcategories, 5, People, 13, Bender, Gestalt, Test, 0, Gestalt, Laws, 1, Gestalt, Therapy, 28, Isomorphis­m, 0, Sites, 3,
