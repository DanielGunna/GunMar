Category, Permissions, Joint, Meta, Forum, Abuse, Editall/Catmv, Features, Introduction, Category, Moderators,, a.k.a., CatMods,, provide, leadership, in, specific, sub-communities,, and, round, out, the, leadership, ranks, of, the, editing, community., CatMods, have, a, unique, set, of, privileges, which, combine, the, aspects, of, the, Editall, and, Meta, permissions,, but, their, scope, is, limited, to, one, top, level, category, node, (e.g., Arts,, Computers,, etc.)., The, purpose, of, this, role, is, to, allow, exceptional, editors, who, specialize, in, a, top, level, category,, the, ability, to, become, a, leader,, or, moderator,, and, to, oversee, the, needs, of, individual, category, nodes., Category, Moderators, should, lead, forum, discussions, in, their, subjects,, mentor, new, editors,, keep, editors, on, track, with, reorganizations, and, current, events,, and, essentially, be, the, expert, for, that, given, category., General, Guidelines, CatMods,, as, leaders, of, their, category, node,, are, expected, to, focus, more, on, the, community-related, aspects, of, higher, editing., Each, sub-community, should, embrace, the, CatMod, as, their, first, point, of, contact, for, any, conflicts, or, issues,, including, heated, taxonomy, discussions, or, editor, disputes, and, abuse., Likewise,, the, CatMod, should, keep, up, to, date, with, all, related, forum, threads,, and, seek, out, editors, to, promote,, as, well, as, sift, out, abusers., Category, Moderators, have, the, following, permissions:, Ability, to, view, and, process, New, Category, Permissions, for, their, category, node, Access, to, the, private, Joint, Meta, forum, Ability, to, warn, editors, and, post, notes, on, an, editor's, profile, Editall/Catmv, for, their, category, node, only, Ability, to, view, and, process, reinstatements, for, their, category, node, Although, initially, CatMod, had, a, 6-month, term, limit,, it, has, been, extended, to, a, more, permanent, permission,, although, it, can, still, be, revoked, (e.g., for, non-use), or, changed, to, Meta, at, any, time, by, Admin, consensus., CatMod, is, not, normally, granted, for, more, than, one, category, node, at, a, time., Since, the, CatMod, has, many, of, the, same, privileges, as, the, Editall, and, Meta,, much, of, the, text, below, are, direct, excerpts, from, the, Editall, and, Meta, Guidelines., It, would, be, helpful, to, read, those, Guidelines, in, full, to, give, you, an, overview, of, their, responsibilities,, and, how, the, duties, of, a, CatMod, relate, to, those, of, the, other, positions, of, leadership, in, DMOZ., New, Category, Permissions, CatMods, have, the, ability, to, access, the, New, Category, Permissions, (new, perms), queue., However,, their, access, and, ability, to, process, applications, is, limited, to, their, specific, category, node, and, below., For, instance,, an, Arts/, CatMod, can, only, view, applications, submitted, for, an, Arts/, category., We, expect, CatMods, to, have, an, excellent, grasp, of, their, fellow, category, editors,, as, well, as, the, special, issues, and, needs, of, certain, categories,, and, will, rely, on, their, expertise, to, make, good, decisions, in, processing, newperms., Below, is, the, guideline, for, New, Category, Permissions,, adapted, from, the, Meta, Guidelines:, Be, judicious, about, who, you, approve, for, new, permissions., Remember,, it, is, very, labor, intensive, to, clean, up, after, a, bad, editor,, so, it, is, important, to, keep, these, things, in, mind, when, evaluating, a, new, permissions, applicant:, Check, to, see, how, many, active, editors, are, in, the, category, the, applicant, wants, to, edit., There, may, be, enough, active, editors, already., Look, at, the, applicant's, Total, Edits, -, unique, adds, and, deletes., Unique, adds, show, a, commitment, to, growing, the, directory., Check, for, recent, activity., Review, a, few, of, the, edits., Are, the, titles, and, descriptions, clean?, Have, the, sub, categories, the, editor, has, created, been, logical?, Should, the, editor, have, a, business, interest, in, the, category,, do, they, look, to, be, doing, a, fair, and, unbiased, build, out, of, content?, Are, the, sites, in, their, category, appropriate, for, the, category?, Have, they, marked, their, own, site, as, cool?, Check, out, the, date, the, editor, first, joined, DMOZ., Are, there, any, profile, notes, that, indicate, past, abuse,, poor, editing,, etc., or, positive, notes, indicating, outstanding, work?, If, you, are, unsure, of, the, applicant,, there, are, a, couple, of, things, you, can, try., Check, to, see, if, there, have, been, any, problems, with, this, editor, by, reviewing, the, forums, and, communicating, with, other, Category, Moderators,, Editalls,, and, Metas., Look, at, the, applicant's, previous, requests., In, some, cases, another, CatMod, or, Meta, may, have, rejected, them,, and, you, can, thus, follow, up, and, find, out, why,, if, it, isn't, evident, from, the, notes., Joint, Meta, Forum, This, forum, was, initially, created, as, a, place, to, house, discussions, between, the, classic, DMOZ, Metas, and, the, Kids, &, Teens, Metas., Many, of, the, issues, pertain, to, editor, discussions, and, issues, that, overlap, the, entire, directory., As, a, CatMod,, it, is, important, to, have, access, to, these, discussions,, especially, when, processing, newperms., Joint, Meta, should, be, your, primary, area, to, discuss, any, difficult, issues, regarding, editors, with, the, Meta, community., Most, likely,, a, Meta, will, be, able, to, guide, you, in, the, right, direction,, or, the, Meta, community, will, be, able, to, provide, a, consensus, when, a, decision, needs, to, be, made., All, reports, of, editor, abuse, should, also, be, posted, in, Joint, Meta., Abuse, Unfortunately,, part, of, keeping, the, directory, clean, and, running, smoothly, means, that, you, will, uncover, abuse, from, time, to, time., Although, CatMods, do, not, have, the, ability, to, remove, editor, permissions,, they, can, issue, a, formal, warning, to, an, editor, about, their, abusive, editing, and/or, report, the, editor, in, the, Joint, Meta, forum, where, the, Meta, community, may, decide, to, take, further, action, against, the, editor., Catmods, can, participate, fully, (including, voting, when, applicable), in, discussions, as, long, as, the, permissions, of, the, editor, concerned, are, within, the, node, of, the, directory, that, the, CatMod, oversees., CatMods, can, also, investigate, abuse, reports,, but, should, only, do, so, in, cases, that, affect, editors, or, categories, within, their, node., If, matters, addressed, in, the, abuse, report, (or, uncovered, in, investigating, the, report), extend, outside, the, boundaries, of, a, CatMod's, node,, the, CatMod, should, relinquish, the, "Investigator", role, and, alert, a, meta, to, the, situation., Below, is, an, adaptation, of, the, abuse, section, of, the, Meta, Guidelines:, As, a, Category, Moderator,, you, will, undoubtedly, come, across, instances, of, bad, editing, and, potential, editor, abuse., In, cases, where, an, editor, is, not, following, the, guidelines,, you, should, use, editor, guidance, flags, which, enable, editors, including, CatMods, to, leave, helpful, comments, on, individual, listings, for, other, editors, to, see., Pink, in, color,, they, work, best, where, active, editing, is, taking, place,, and, for, less, important, issues;, otherwise, feedback, or, use, of, the, Warning, feature, to, send, a, documented, notice, to, the, editor, may, be, more, appropriate., Keep, in, mind, that, we, are, all, human,, and, some, editors, are, not, as, active,, and, aware, of, DMOZ, culture, as, others., Please, be, diplomatic, and, courteou
