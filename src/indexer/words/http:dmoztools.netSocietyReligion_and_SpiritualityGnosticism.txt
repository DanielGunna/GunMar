is, derived, from, the, Greek, term, "gnosis", which, means, "to, know,", and, is, the, root, of, many, English, words, (dia-gno-sis,, kno-wledge,, i-gno-re)., Gnosticism, refers, to, an, exceptionally, wide, variety, of, groups, who, seek, "Gnosis,", or, direct,, spiritual, knowledge,, as, opposed, to, those, groups, who, rely, exclusively, on, belief., The, term, Gnosis, or, Gnosticism, has, been, used, in, spiritual, teachings, for, unknown, centuries., It, was, used, in, early, Greek, philosophy, and, expressed, the, foundation, of, the, Greek, Mystery, Schools,, yet, it, is, still, debated, today, which, came, first:, the, Greek, "Gnosis", or, the, Sanskrit, "Jnana,", a, term, commonly, associated, with, Jnana, Yoga,, or, the, path, of, the, knowledge, of, the, divine,, whose, age, and, origin, is, unknown., Nonetheless,, there, is, evidence, that, the, ancient, Greek, and, Hindu, schools, of, divine, knowledge, learned, from, each, other., Some, say, that, Alexander, the, Great, sought, for, Gnosis, among, the, Indian, yogis., It, is, commonly, believed, that, Gnosticism, refers, exclusively, to, a, handful, of, philosophical, schools, of, the, late, Hellenistic, and, early, Christian, eras., Yet, scholars, have, recognized, that, these, groups, were, born, from, Jewish, mysticism,, Hellenistic, mystery, cults,, Iranian, religious, dualism, (see, Zoroastrianism),, and, Babylonian, and, Egyptian, mythology,, thus, the, term, "Gnostic", would, describe, a, vast, sea, of, religious, knowledge., Scholars, present, Gnosticism, as, a, collection, of, movements, that, opposed, the, "mainstream", of, Christianity,, such, as, those, formed, by, Valentinus, and, Basilides., It, is, widely, recognized, that, a, large, portion, of, early, Christian, doctrine, (and, therefore, its, descendants), were, developed, in, reaction, to, these, other, ideas., But, the, actual, knowledge, and, teachings, of, these, "Gnostic", groups, were, known, only, from, what, their, enemies, wrote, (writers, such, as, St., Irenaeus,, St., Hippolytus,, Tertullian,, and, Clement, of, Alexandria)., In, the, twentieth-century,, certain, Manichaean, and, Coptic, Gnostic, papyri, were, discovered,, providing, the, first, extant, Gnostic, Gospels, and, writings., Important, texts, include, The, Gospel, of, Thomas, and, the, Pistis, Sophia., These, texts, opened, a, world, thought, lost,, and, presented, to, modern, humanity, the, ideas, and, teachings, that, gave, rise, to, the, persecution, of, the, "heretics", (Gnostics), and, the, long, and, troubled, history, of, what, has, been, established, as, Christianity., Alternatively,, one, modern, writer, described, Gnosis, as, being, present, in, every, genuine, school, of, mysticism:, "This, is, the, Religion, of, Wisdom, of, the, ancient, Sacerdotal, Colleges,, of, the, Gymnosophists,, or, solitary, JINNS, from, Central, Asia,, of, the, Iohanes,, Samoans,, Egyptian, Ascetics,, ancient, Pythagorians,, medieval, Rosacrucians,, Templars,, primeval, Masons, and, other, more, or, less, known, esoteric, Brotherhoods, whose, list, would, occupy, dozens, of, pages., This, is, the, Secret, Doctrine, of, the, Knights, of, the, Holy, Grail., This, is, the, Living, Stone, of, Jacob, Gnosis, is, the, flame, from, which, all, the, religions, of, the, Universe, come, forth.", In, modern, times,, Gnosticism, is, a, widely, abused, term,, giving, rise, to, many, conflicting, ideas, as, to, what, precisely, is, meant, by, it., There, are, hundreds, of, "Gnostic", churches,, groups,, teachings,, writers, and, schools,, each, claiming, to, have, the, true, Gnosis,, the, true, knowledge, of, the, divine., These, modern, groups, range, from, small, study, groups, analyzing, the, ancient, gospels,, to, movements, that, claim, millions, of, members., Truly,, Gnosticism, is, not, a, collection, of, dead, cults;, it, is, a, living, tradition, that, has, persisted, under, many, faces,, but, which, has, never, been, extinguished,, for, it, is, the, heart, of, the, human, experience:, direct,, intimate, knowledge, of, higher, truths., Subcategories, 10, Ancient, History, 10,
