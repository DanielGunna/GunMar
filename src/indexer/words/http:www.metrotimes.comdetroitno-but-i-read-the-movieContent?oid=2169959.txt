there’s, a, movie, one, isn’t, familiar, with,, the, question, will, generally, be, “what’s, it, about?”, —, how, much, of, the, plot, can, you, tell, me, without, giving, away, any, crucial, story, developments?, If, one, wants, to, delve, deeper,, reviewers, will, happily, supply, comments, on, character, delineation,, foreshadowing,, symbolism, and, narrative, arc, with, the, understanding, that, a, movie, is, the, final, version, of, a, script,, and, that, a, script, is, a, kind, of, play,, and, that, a, play,, when, written, down,, is, a, book., If, there’s, any, acknowledgment, that, film, is, a, unique, medium, with, intrinsic, values, and, elements, all, its, own,, it, usually, comes, in, the, dutiful, pronouncement, that, the, visuals, are, “stunning”, and, the, direction, “assured.”, That’s, pretty, much, the, continual, state, of, things,, though, there, was, a, time, when, it, seemed, as, though, it, might, change., During, the, ’50s,, a, group, of, young, French, film, critics,, centered, mostly, around, a, periodical, called, Cahiers, du, Cinema,, responded, to, the, postwar, influx, of, American, movies, with, what, would, be, considered, in, the, States, as, indiscriminate, enthusiasm., Reacting, to, what, they, perceived, as, the, sterility, of, their, own, country’s, dominant, tradition, of, well-mounted,, literary-like, productions,, they, found, in, our, B, movies, and, genre, flicks, fresh, and, enticing, signs, of, individual, expression, —, not, in, the, often, ordinary, and, even, dismal, screenplays,, but, in, the, films, themselves., Spotting, recurring, visual, motifs,, themes, and, attitudes, toward, the, basic, materials, of, the, script,, they, designated, the, director, as, the, auteur, (or, author), of, the, film., This, may, all, seem, rather, abstract,, but, the, consequences, were, very, concrete., In, America,, in, the, ’50s,, it, was, eccentric, to, consider, directors, such, as, Alfred, Hitchcock,, Howard, Hawks, or, John, Ford,, let, alone, lesser, lights, such, as, Anthony, Mann, or, Sam, Fuller,, to, be, in, any, sense, artists,, let, alone, filmic, auteurs., Fine, craftsmen,, expert, entertainers,, good, filmmakers,, maybe., And, the, standard, for, what, constituted, a, good, film, was, a, literary, one, —, a, good, film, had, a, good, story., A, great, film, had, a, good, story, and, a, sort, of, social, relevance., In, the, ’50s, and, early, ’60s,, Stanley, Kramer,, who, broached, the, topics, of, racism,, the, Scopes, trial,, nuclear, war, and, the, Nuremberg, trial,, was, considered, a, great, director,, despite, the, fact, that, his, movies, were, often, as, flat, as, pageants,, carried, along, by, star, power, —, which, led, the, critic, Gavin, Lambert, to, describe, Judgment, at, Nuremberg, (1961), as, “an, all-star, concentration, camp, drama,, with, special, guest, victim, appearances.”, But, as, the, French, approach, began, to, reach, America,, it, effected, a, shift, in, critical, consciousness, which, allowed, the, above-mentioned, directors, to, be, taken, more, seriously, (sometimes, too, seriously)., Since, many, of, the, Cahiers, critics, —, Truffaut,, Godard,, Rohmer,, Chabrol, etc., —, became, filmmakers,, the, earliest, and, most, convincing, arguments, for, the, auteur, theory, to, get, an, airing, in, the, States, were, actual, movies., Godard’s, Breathless, (1959),, Truffaut’s, The, 400, Blows, (1959),, and, Chabrol’s, Les, Bonnes, Femmes, (1960), were, meant, to, be, evaluated, as, films, (judged, as, books, they, would, be, deemed, sloppy, and, even, incoherent)., During, the, ’60s, and, ’70s,, then,, a, great, critical, re-evaluation, took, place, as, a, cinematic, standard, came, into, play., Hitchcock, et, al, were, lifted, from, the, realm, of, the, clever, and, edged, toward, the, pantheon, of, the, profound, —, while, previously, obscure, toilers, in, the, twilight, world, of, déclassé, entertainment, such, as, Fuller, and, Edgar, G., Ulmer, were, bought, into, the, light, and, decreed, to, be, genuine, artists,, as, well, as, rugged, individualists, in, a, world, of, studio, blandness., Eventually,, this, radical, concept, became, received, wisdom,, trickling, down, from, the, critical, elite, upon, the, humble, heads, of, daily, reviewers., By, the, mid-’70s,, anybody, who, gave, a, damn, about, movies, could, tell, you, of, the, rise, and, fall, of, Sam, Peckinpah, and, why, Stanley, Kramer, didn’t, date, very, well., Unfortunately,, the, idea, behind, the, elevation, of, the, director, —, that, a, movie, isn’t, a, book, —, never, really, caught, on, in, any, widespread, way,, probably, because, to, many, it’s, just, a, very, unsatisfying, way, of, looking, at, things., As, a, result,, you’ll, find, a, haze, of, cognitive, dissonance, running, through, a, lot, of, mainstream, reviews., The, director’s, importance, is, a, given,, but, just, why, is, rarely, made, clear., Scriptwriters, are, often, banished, from, consideration, while, their, contribution, is, given, bottom-line, importance, —, and, often, attributed, to, the, director., A, writer’s, clever, script, becomes, a, sign, of, a, director’s, playful, touch,, while, another, writer’s, downbeat, ending, is, further, evidence, of, another, director’s, penchant, for, dark, realism., (Adaptations, are, not, safe, from, this, sort, of, thing., One, critic, remarked, how, the, ending, of, the, movie, version, of, Moby, Dick, (1956), was, yet, another, example, of, John, Huston’s, ironic, fatalism.), Aside, from, that, —, aside, from, the, confusion, which, comes, from, having, general, critical, consciousness, lodged, partly, in, and, largely, outside, the, confines, of, the, auteur, theory, —, things, are, better, than, they, were., Prejudices, against, genre, movies, have, largely, vanished, (except, for, horror, films,, which, are, going, through, a, phase, of, great, sucking),, once-disposable, directors, are, now, hallowed, icons, (I’m, still, waiting, for, them, to, issue, that, Sam, Fuller, stamp), and, many, directors, have, effected, a, rapprochement, between, film’s, singularity, and, an, interesting, narrative., Now, if, the, public, could, just, get, over, its, fetish, for, plots,, the, world, would, be, just, about, perfect., Richard, C., Walls, writes, about, the, arts, for, the, Metro, Times.,
