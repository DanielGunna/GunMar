CHARLOTTESVILLE,, VIRGINIA,, ORIGINALLY, DECEMBER, 1994], Introduction:, Women, in, Cinema, -, A, Reference, Guide, Film,, cinema,, movies,, motion, pictures, --, covers, a, wide, range, of, topics., Though, "Women, in, Cinema", narrows, the, topic, in, one, sense, to, a, particular, type, of, film,, at, the, same, time, it, broadens, it, to, include, many, aspects, of, topics, such, as, feminism,, the, women's, movement,, and, women's, issues., The, study, of, film, encompasses, a, wide, variety, of, types,, historical, periods,, national, productions,, and, related, topics., Many, studies, of, film, concentrate, on, fictional,, full-length, feature, films,, though, there, are, other, types, such, as, shorts,, non-fictional, documentaries,, and, docu-dramas., Various, studies, divide, the, film, production, into, various, periods,, from, the, beginnings, in, 1896,, dependent, on, major, developments, in, film, production, (silents,, sound,, color,, etc.), or, in, historical, periods, (pre-World, War, I,, the, Twenties,, the, Depression,, World, War, II,, post-World, War, II,, the, 50s, and, 60s,, post-60s,, Film, Noire,, etc.)., Most, studies, in, North, America, concentrate, on, Hollywood, studio, production, films, and, some, on, non-, Hollywood, feature, films., However,, other, nations, or, world-regions, have, developed, their, own, trends, and, history, of, film, production,, whether, in, France,, Germany,, Britain,, Italy,, Japan,, Latin, America,, India,, etc., The, study, of, film, relates, to, a, wide, range, of, other, topics, -, literature,, stage,, art,, costumes,, aesthetics,, ethics,, culture,, erotica, and, pornography,, television,, technical, inventions,, computers,, etc., These,, like, many, aspects, of, the, study, of, film,, have, complex, relationships, and, interaction., Thus,, American, viewers, in, the, 1990s, have, available, television, programs, (via, networks,, cable,, video, or, CD-ROMS), based, on, fictional, and, non-fictional, literature, or, plays, or, films., There, are, 'made, for, television', movies,, or, feature, and, other, films, shown, on, television,, films, made, from, books,, books, made, from, screen, plays,, and, biographies, of, film, stars, made, into, Some, of, these, incarnated, formats, are, surrounded, by, a, whole, set, of, studies, on, mass, media, techniques,, interpretations,, fan, books, and, magazines,, as, well, as, commercial, products, of, dolls,, toys,, and, other, products., One, set, of, studies, is, concerned, with, women, in, film, --, their, roles, and, participation, in, cinema,, audience, reception, and, perception, of, women, on, the, screen,, and, the, implications, of, those, productions, and, their, impact,, whether, past,, present,, or, future., The, study, of, women, in, cinema, occupies, that, wide,, still-evolving, space, between, the, general, studies, on, film, and, feminist, or, women, studies., The, pull, of, these, two, poles, may, be, represented,, for, example,, by, the, Handbook, of, American, Film, Genres, (1988), and, Sue-Ellen, Case's, "Toward, a, Butch-Femme, Aesthetic", (Hart,, 1989)., [1], The, Handbook, does, not, include, any, genre, on, women, as, such,, but, does, allow, it, partly, (and, only), to, be, subsumed, under, a, chapter, on, "Melodrama.", This, hallmark, characteristic, of, general, film, studies, to, ignore, or, subsume, the, serious, study, of, women, in, film, provides, feminists, with, a, stimulus, to, attempt, to, develop, their, own, studies, and, views, of, women, in, film,, as, represented,, perhaps, in, the, extreme,, with, Case's, formulations., The, battle, between, the, sexes,, on, these, film, issues, as, with, other, issues,, continues;, but, not, necessarily, without, progress., The, history, of, women, in, film, is, as, long, as, film, production., Women, have, been, involved, with, films, from, the, beginning, (1896),, though, feminist, film, studies, arose, much, later,, like, many, other, 'movements,', in, the, late, 1960s., Alice, Guy, Blache, produced, "The, Cabbage, Fairy", in, 1896,, and, followed, with, 5, films, the, next, year,, including, "The, Bewitched, Fiance", and, "He.", [2], Partly, from, the, stimulus, of, the, May, 1968, events, in, Paris, and, France,, the, previously, apolitical, Cahiers, du, Cinema, changed, its, editorial, policy, to, advocating, ideological, analysis, of, films., [3], In, turn,, these, events, abroad, and, the, Civil, Rights, movement, in, the, United, States,, stimulated, the, study, and, rethinking, of, women, in, film,, as, part, of, the, wider, Women's, Movement, in, the, United, States, and, elsewhere., The, journals, of, Women, and, Film, (1972-1975),, and, Camera, Obscura:, A, Journal, of, Feminism, and, Film, Theory, (Berkeley,, 1976-), emerged., The, ideas, in, those, journals, stimulated, further, discussion, and, discourse, in, the, seven, issues, of, the, Canadian, journal, of, Cineaction:, A, Magazine, of, Radical, Film, Criticism, and, Film, Theory, (1985-).[4], Thus, from, the, late, 1960s,, the, study, of, women, in, film, has, emerged, and, grown, through, the, rising, production, of, journals,, books,, conferences,, festivals,, academic, course, offerings,, archival, holdings,, and, reference, materials., From, its, early, beginnings, in, the, late, 1960s, to, the, present,, feminist, film, criticism, has, evolved, both, as, developing, its, own, niche, of, many, theories, and, attempting, to, remain, within, the, 'mainstream.', In, these, ways,, it, has, attempted, to, be, both, a, reformist, ideology, and, remain, accessible, as, an, entertainment, resource., Some, studies, have, emphasized, the, divisions, between, feminist, critics, of, the, west, and, east, side, of, the, Atlantic, Ocean;, between, an, emphasis, of, theory, and, history;, between, the, images, of, film, or, 'what', is, presented, and, 'how', or, the, 'cinema, apparatus', of, film, production;, and, finally, between, the, relationship, of, 'culture', as, a, mirror, or, representation, in, film, and, the, 'signification', or, signs, and, symbols, on, spectators, of, film., [5], Especially, in, recent, years,, the, feminists', discussion,, theories,, and, debates, about, women, in, cinema, have, included, theories, of, Freud,, Marx,, Neo-Marxists,, Foucault,, Derida,, and, others;, and, thus, included, the, approaches, and, ideas, of, psychoanalysis,, semeiotics,, poststructuralists,, and, deconstructionists., Many, people, seem, to, find, these, theories,, constructions,, and, deconstructions, about, women, in, film, too, strident,, intellectual,, elitist,, or, 'high-falootin.', On, the, other, end,, attempting, to, remain, within, the, 'mainstream,', there, are, lists, of, 'women's, films,', annual, lists, of, the, top, 10, of, 'women's', films,, and, documentaries, dealing, with, the, 'hot, button', issues, of, the, day, for, high, school, audiences, and, others., These, would, include, the, somewhat, dated, Women's, Films, in, Print, (1975), with, distributors', addresses,, the, 1992, and, 1993, lists, of, the, Labyrises, top, ten, films,, and, "Images:, Women, and, Issues,", some, 22, documentaries, for, young, audiences, dealing, with, practical, issues, such, as, teen, and, single, pregnancy,, females, in, the, workplace,, female, poverty,, harassment,, eating, disorders,, self-esteem,, dating, and, date-rape., [6], The, study, of, women, in, film, remains, pulled, by, the, two, poles, of, general, film, studies, and, of, feminist, film, studies., The, problems, remain, --, that, the, general, film, studies, are, often, not, specific, enough, for, good., sources, on, 'women,', while, the, women, film, studies, are, often, too, oriented, to, women's, issues,, without, clear, insight, on, film, issues., In, these, circumstances,, researchers, for, reference, materials, on, 'women, in, film', might, first, look, at, general, film, reference, bibliographies,, in, order, to, find, some, specific, reference, works, on, women, in, film, within, them., Using, these, citations,, the, researcher, might, expand, to, gender-specific, sources., Film, studies,, as, such,, rely, mainly, on, 1), reference, guides,, 2), indexes,, 3), reviews, or, filmographies, or, catalogs, or, surveys,, 4), biographical, sources,, and, 5), miscellaneous, sources., There, are, very, few, or, valuable, handbooks,, almanacs,, yearbooks,, and, encyclopedias., The, same, is, true, for, reference, sources, in, women, in, film., Anthologies, of, essays, on, women's, film, criticism, dominate, in, the, reference, works, in, this, field, of, study;, along, with, some, filmographies, and, directories, (mainly, of, directors)., One, would, hope, that, publishers, might, soon, fill, these, gaps, of, women, in, film, with, reference, guides,, more, indexes,, and, some, almanacs,, yearbooks,, and, encyclopedias., One, of, the, ways, these, gaps, are, partially, being, filled, is, by, on-line, databases, from, centers, of, women's, studies., Two, of, them, are, already, notable, and, might, be, expanded, -, 1), the, one, for, the, University, of, Wisconsin, and, for, 2), the, other, for, the, University, of, Maryland., [7], Most, materials, for, women, in, film, will, be, found, under, the, Library, of, Congress, call, number, of, "PN, 1995.9, .W9", etc., The, major, LC, subject, heading, for, these, studies, is, Subject:, Women, in, motion, pictures, Researchers, should, be, very, aware, that, the, use, of, 'films', or, 'movies', connected, with, 'females', or, 'feminists', might, produce, very, few, or, incomplete, 'finds', or, 'hits.', In, conclusion,, reference, materials, on, women, in, film, could, use, some, basic, additions,, especially, in, print, form., As, yet,, the, databases, and, files, available, online,, though, developed, and, developing, for, reference, for, women, in, film,, are, not, democratically, or, widely, accessible., One, hopes, that, this, accessibility, will, become, more, democratic, and, that, the, reference, items, will, continually, expand, and, be, constantly, updated., But,, until, that, happens,, publishers, could, easily, make, basic, reference, materials, on, women, in, film, available, to, the, public, through, sale, or, in, libraries., Such, reference, materials, would, certainly, help, to, fill, the, continuing, gap, between, the, poles, of, the, too-general, film, studies, and, the, too-specific, and, ideological, women's, film, studies., ============================================================================, REFERENCE, SOURCES, FOR, WOMEN, IN, CINEMA, Both, general, film, sources, and, specialized, women's, film, sources, are, selectively, listed., Again,, the, problem, with, both, is, that, general, sources, include, few, women's, items, and, women's, sources, often, concentrate, on, wider, feminist, issues, rather, than, focusing, on, films., Both, type, of, sources, need, to, be, investigated., Given, the, nature, of, the, topic, and, the, available, literature,, some, types, of, reference, sources, are, both, rare, and, not, included., They, are, mainly, encyclopedias,, handbooks,, yearbooks,, directories,, etc., Rather, this, list, consists, of, I., Bibliographies, and, guides., A., General.,

1986., xii,, 209, p., ;, 25, cm., (Clemons, Reference, Z5784, .M9, F535, 1986), This, general,, annotated, guide, provides, 10, basic, sources, on, women, in, film., Almost, all, of, the, publications, unfortunately, are, from, the, 1970s., The, guide, is, divided, into, 15, sections, with, author, and, subject, indexes, at, the, back,, covering, topics, from, Bibliographic, Guides,, Biographies,, Filmographies, and, videographies,, to, Societies, and, Associations., Most, of, the, sources, (6), on, women, are, listed, under, Filmographies, and, Videographies., The, annotations, of, three, or, more, sentences, evaluate, scope,, number, and, type, of, inclusions,, purposes,, as, well, as, comparisons, to, similar, sources., Fisher, includes, and, describes, one, women's, association, -, the, Los, Angeles', Women, in, Film,, which, acts, "as, a, clearinghouse, and, support, group, for, women, in, these, industries., It, also, plays, an, educational, role, through,

1988), The, brief, inclusion, of, both, of, these, items, points, to, the, inadequacy, of, general, film, reference, sources, to, provide, good, annotations, or, descriptions, for, subject-specific, film, topics., While, Wulff's, BIBLIOGRAPHIE, is, international, in, coverage,, and, even, includes, a, special, section, on, eastern, European, film,, he, lists, only, 7, items, on, "Women, in, /, and, the, movies", (p., 154., Only, 2, of, those, 7, are, briefly, annotated., "Women", fall, under, "Genre, Studies, and, Partial, Histories.", Gehring, is, not, really, a, 'handbook', and, there, is, no, particular, "Women's, genre", among, these, 18, identified, genres,, ranging, from, 'Adventure, Film', to, 'The, Art, Film.', Women,, as, such,, are, included, under, the, 16th, genre,, "Melodrama.", Steven, Lipkin's, essay, ends, with, a, selected,, brief, listing, of, bibliographic, and, filmographic, sources, (total, 28)., The, attitude, represented, by, this, type, of, reference,

overview, for, the, study, of, women, in, cinema,, as, well, as, annotations, on, books, or, articles, (42), and, films, (3), on, the, topic, (p., 490-526)., Both, before, and, after, the, "Feminist", section,, there, are, some, interesting, ideas, and, reviews, of, "Ideology, versus, Entertainment", (p., 455-465), and, "The, Pleasure, Factor", (p., 527-534)., All, of, these, are, under, the, somewhat, objectionable, category, "Chapter, 3:, Stereotyping, in, Film.", Manchel, divides, feminist, film, critics, between, American, and, British,, but, then, goes, on, to, emphasize, (as, Gledhill, does), similarities, of, feminists', approaches, to, film, who, consider, three, different, categories, from, which, to, analyze, films, of, sociological,, psychoanalytic,, and, textual, (including, semeiotics)., Overall,, both, Manchel, in, his, review, and, feminists, in, their, criticisms, emphasize, the, complicated, nature, of, film, and, the, many, legitimate, approaches, and, interpretations, about, film., Some, feminist, critics, also, emphasize, the, ideological, aspects, of, film, as, part, of, cultural, politics,, as, shown, in, the, transition, from, apolitical, film, criticism, before, the, late, 1960s, and, the, highly, ideological, criticism, of, film, since, that, time., If, there, has, been, any, trend, in, the, feminist, film, ideology,, it, is, from, an, approach, of, film, in, social, context, to, film, in, psychoanalytic, context,, to, film, in, literary, textual, and, semiotic, context,, to, film, as, signifier, and, representative, among, spectators, (audience)., Manchel, prefers, to, see, these, trends, as, challenges, rather, than, contradictions,, as, a, progress, to, a, better, understanding, rather, than, divergent, strands, leading, away, from, each, other., Manchel's, annotations, are, uneven,, some, two, pages, long,, while, others, are, less, than, two, sentences, long., In, his, essay, on, the, "Feminist, Approach,", he, ends,, without, a, clear, break, or, transition,, with, a, discussion, of, using, films, for, products, and, advertisements, (Mickey, Mouse, watches),, and, whether, directors,, as, auteurs,, intended, or, had, any, control, over, commercial, or, other, messages, conveyed, in, their, films, to, audiences., Manchel, might, have, made, these, discussions, clearly, separate, from, the,
