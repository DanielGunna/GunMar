page., Also, visit, the:, Music, Scale, page, to, see, why, there, are, 12, notes, in, the, musical, scale, Introduction, I'm, not, exactly, sure, of, the, general, consensus,, but, I, have, often, heard, the, opinion, that, with, music, for, example:, "There, can, be, no, final,, or, definitive, judgement", or, that, "One, person's, subjective, opinion, is, just, as, valid, as, another, -, and, that, it's, only, a, matter, of, personal, preference"., In, other, words,, many, believe, that, music, is, only, good, because, our, minds, are, individually, (and, in, different, ways), -, 'programmed', or, 'geared', (for, whatever, reasons), to, enjoy, it, from, their, perspective., This, is, called, the, "Subjective, or, Relative, Aesthetics, View", Well,, no, doubt, people's, 'taste', is, biased, (to, varying, degrees), due, to, a, number, of, reasons:-, what, they're, 'used, to', hearing,, 'cultural, trend',, simply, their, quality, of, taste, in, music,, or, even, 'nostalgia', (though, obviously, a, tune, could, still, be, nostalgic, to, someone, and, good)., Download, the, music, that, inspired, me, to, write, this, page!, (music, in, mp3, format), But, if, as, I, think,, music, is, ultimately, objective, -, this, would, mean, that, even, if, we, didn't, exist,, every, infinite, possibility, in, music, has, a, degree, of, quality, to, it, (whether, good, or, bad),, which, would, make, it, stand, up, in, its, own, right., In, other, words,, every, picture, or, piece, of, music, contains, an, inherent, (mathematical?), 'goodness', intrinsic, to, that, design., In, the, same, way,, all, graphics, and, artwork, can, be, given, a, definitive, aesthetic, evaluation, -, and, that, even, if, no-one, knows, for, sure, how, good, it, /really/, is, -, that, doesn't, mean, to, say, this, 'judgement, score', doesn't, exist., Theoretically, then,, the, better, one's, taste, in, music, -, generally, -, the, closer, one, would, agree, with, this, 'Universal, Aesthetic', or, 'Universal, Musical, Evaluation', (UME)., For, the, sake, of, argument,, I'm, going, to, focus, on, music, with, a, mini-section, on, what, makes, the, best, graphics/pictures, near, the, end, of, this, article., Aesthetics, of, music, theory, "Surely, it's, too, simple, to, give, a, piece, of, music, one, score?", Well,, it's, possible,, but, incomplete, to, give, just, one, ('average'), score, to, a, piece, of, music,, so, perhaps, more, appropriately,, 3-5, (maybe, more!), scores, judging, the:, melody/harmony,, melodic/harmonic, structure,, rhythm/intricacy,, time, duration/structure, and, timbre, (the, lowest, 'level', of, sound/music), would, be, ideal., All, these, aspects, of, music, are, very, much, interwoven, which, is, why, it, gets, so, confusing,, but, I, believe, they, can, all, be, rated, -, with, the, very, best, music, containing, high, scores, for, all, of, these, attributes., Of, course,, each, 'whole', piece, of, music, is, greater, than, the, 'sum, of, its, parts',, but, no, doubt, if, you, were, to, break, a, tune, down, -, every, single, chord,, 'sub-melody', or, 'bit', of, that, tune, could, be, rated, and, evaluated, on, all, the, aforementioned, attributes, -, too., One, important, point, is, that, one, tune, can, still, be, better, than, another,, but, with, the, /overall/, worse, tune, containing, something, the, better, one, hasn't, got, -, thus, it, isn't, a, worthless, piece, of, music, compared, to, the, 'better', one., I, should, imagine, this, applies, especially, to, the, chords, or, melody, of, a, piece, (as, opposed, to, the, orchestration/structure)., "But, if, music, could, be, given, a, definitive, rating/s,, surely, there, would, also, be, a, mathematical/programmable, formula, to, make, the, best, music?", Well,, it's, a, good, point,, maybe, there, /is/, a, 'formula', to, create, the, best, music;, it's, just, that's, it, would, be, so, very,, very, complex, that, it'll, be, millennia, before, we, can, attempt, to, find, it., Also,, maybe, the, best, music, is, so,, so, complex, that, an, increasingly, complex, formula, is, required, for, increasingly, better, and, better, music., (See, later, for, how, complex, a, possible, formula, might, be.), "Is, there, such, thing, as, a, perfect....., melody, or, chord, sequence?", Maybe., Or, maybe, there, are, a, dimension, of, perfect, melodies., I, only, know, that, for, every, good, melody/harmony, that, could, exist,, there, are, thousands/millions, of, potentially, bad, melodies., What's, amazing, is, how, a, tune's, quality, can, be, good, in, so, many, different, ways, -, each, 'style', with, its, own, impact, on, the, emotions., There's, probably, a, vast, multi-dimensional, hierarchy, to, chord, sequences, for, example., The, best, chord, combinations, are, at, the, top, -, all, unique,, brilliant, and, varied., Fruity, chord, fun, Here's, a, completely, unscientific, but, fun, way, of, describing, the, quality, of, all, those, chords, =), Note, that, 'chord, change', can, refer, to, a, static, chord,, but, generally, refers, to, 2, or, 3, chords, (/, changes)., Sometimes, though,, if, the, chord, 'grows', or, 'develops', over, a, technical, 5, or, even, 10, 'chords',, with, generally, the, same, notes, (but, not, quite), -, this, can, be, said, to, be, part, of, the, 'same', chord/c.change, (if, that, makes, sense, =), Something, like:, Orange, is, a, 'nice', normal, chord/change., ', "Deep", orange', is, the, same, kind, of, 'ordinary', chord, change, -, but, well, implemented., 'Shallow', orange, is, the, same, chord/change, but, not, done, so, well., You, can, probably, guess, what, I'm, going, to, say..., 'Deep', and, 'Pale', apply, to, the, other, 'fruit', chords:, 'Strawberry', -, this, is, more, unusual, than, orange, and, more, fun, to, listen, to., 'Lemon', -, A, 'sour', chord/change, -, great, for, 'tense', climatic, moments, in, tunes., 'Apple', -, for, the, chord, changes, which, don't, need, to, sound, good, in, themselves,, but, are, necessary, to, blend, well, with, the, rest., Tunes, generally, have, lots, of, these., 'Lime', -, A, cross, between, the, 'tense', mysterious-ness, of, Lemon,, and, the, cool, Strawberry, chord., 'Blackberry', -, A, bitter, /, sweet, chord, change, ..., ummm..., similar, to, lemon, but..., erm, nevermind, :), (by, the, way,, these, terms, are, not, at, all, arbitrary, ;-D, The, best, tunes, utilise, all, these, 'types', of, chord, changes, (and, perhaps, use, them, in, a, hierarchical, structure, (i.e., mostly, apple, (fill, in),, a, lot, of, orange,, some, strawberry, /, lime, and, a, couple, of, lemon, /, blackcurrant, twists, put, in, for, good, measure, ;), (All, of, these, would, be, the, 'Deep', (as, opposed, to, Shallow), versions, for, the, best, tunes, by, the, way)., So, for, example,, "Shallow, Lemon", is, a, 'tense', chord, change, that's, more, of, a, whimper., But, 'Rich', (even, stronger, than, 'Deep'!), Strawberry, is, something, to, really, look, forward, to!, Oh,, the, treasured, 'Rich, Kiwifruit', chord, array, has, possibly, the, best, chords, of, all!, (even, better, than, the, Strawberry, chords!!!), "Why, does, someone, think, that, tune, X, is, better, than, tune, Y,, and, someone, else, think, the, reverse?", The, answer, could, well, be, that, one, of, them, has, better, taste, in, music, -, at, least, over, this, tune's, comparison., They, are, picking, up, subtleties, in, the, melody,, chord, patterns, and, rhythm, complexity, that, the, other, person, either, doesn't, or, can't, recognise., Obviously,, it, doesn't, necessarily, mean, that, this, person, has, better, taste, in, music, /overall/, -, just, for, the, various, aspects, in, that, tune, per, se., There's, also, the, small, possibility, that, the, reason/s, they, prefer, the, better, tune, isn't, the, reason/s, that, they, should, prefer, the, better, tune, for, -, thus, reducing, the, validity, of, their, opinion., Yes,, complex, I, know, =), Incidentally,, throughout, this, text,, when, I, refer, to, music, that's, 'better',, I, also, mean, that, it's, more, fun,, 'atmospheric',, enjoyable,, perhaps, exciting, -, and, ultimately, more, rewarding, to, listen, to., If, people, don't, find, the, best, music, to, be, enjoyable,, perhaps, they, are, 'missing, out', and, lack, discernment, (in, one, way, or, another,, to, varying, degrees, and, for, whatever, reasons), in, melody,, rhythm, and, certain, chord, patterns., Without, any, 'All-Time, Super, Formula',, possibly, the, best, way, of, finding, out, who's, right,, is, to, apply, the, 'Test, of, Time', theory., This, asserts, that, a, piece, of, art, is, intrinsically, good, if, held, in, high, regard, throughout, the, ages, -, rather, than, just, 'what's, in, fashion', at, the, time., I, would, guess, that, it's, certainly, a, more, valid, approach, as, it, removes, (most), cultural, bias,, but, nevertheless, -, not, a, definitive, judgement, -, as, there, are, other, factors, in, people's, taste, which, distort, what's, good, or, bad, about, music., Despite, all, of, this,, I, think, there's, a, good, possibility, that, a, quality, of, music, -, better, than, anything, anyone's, ever, heard, on, Earth, -, would, theoretically, appeal, to, practically, everyone!, =), "So, what's, the, best, style, of, music?", Most, 'Styles', (if, done, well), can, contain, the, all, important, aspects, of, what, makes, music, good, -, melody, and, structure., Obviously,, some, 'styles', are, biased, against, melody/harmony, and, other, styles, are, biased, against, rhythmic, variety,, so, those, styles, aren't, so, good, (....the, best, music, combines, both)., Music, is, only, pigeonholed, into, genres, in, the, first, place, because, of, reasons, such, as:, a:, The, cultural, habit, to, imitate, what, already, has, been, done., b:, The, limitations, and, advantages, of, certain, instruments, (e.g., orchestral), and, techniques., c:, The, biases, of, different, music, creation, software, to, make, music, in, a, certain, way, (which, obviously, isn't, necessarily, the, best), d:, Simple, luck, that, a, particular, set, of, instruments, ended, up, with, a, bias, towards, certain, chord, or, rhythmic, progressions, in, the, initial, stage., This, piece, or, set, of, pieces, might, then, be, stylistically, imitated, by, other, people, (see, a), All, of, these, combine, to, form, a, collection, of, recognisable, 'quirks', in, a, piece, of, music, -, thus, enabling, us, to, see, which, 'style', it, is., But, because, music, is, effectively, just, a, combination, of, motifs,, patterns, and, harmonies, put, together,, a, more, thorough, break-down, is, desired., For, example,, music, in, the, style, of, 'rag-time', is, better, described, by, saying, how, the, end, of, each, 'section', (of, which, there, are, usually, many), usually, ends, on, the, 'tonic', chord, (C, major, if, the, key, of, the, piece, is, in, C, major), and, how, the, bass-line, alternates, between, a, single, note, and, a, 3, or, 4, note, chord)., These, are, simple, mathematical, patterns/traits, of, which, /every/, piece, of, music, has, a, certain, degree, of., If, music, has, to, be, given, 'styles', (or, categorised, by, genre),, I, think, the, proper, way, to, do, it, would, be, to, give, them, 'style, tags', separately, for, the, chord, flavour/s,, rhythm, flavour/s,, structural, flavour/s,, speed, tempo/s, and, average, intricacy, of, a, piece., Ideally,, it, would, also, have, a, 'quality, evaluation', tag, too,, but, that's, not, exactly, going, to, happen, with, the, large, discrepancy, of, tastes, in, this, world..., =(, "How, can, you, be, so, sure, that, one, piece, of, music, is, better, than, another?", In, my, opinion,, there's, a, wealth, of, positive, evidence,, but, here's, one, simple, example;, If, one, single, chord, could, be, better, than, another, chord,, then, the, same, reasoning, would, apply, to, a, whole, string, of, chords, -, and, ultimately, to, a, whole, tune., Naturally,, a, chord, that, sounds, bad, in, one, piece, could, fit, very, well, into, another, tune,, but, there, surely, comes, a, point, when, a, chord, is, so, bad, that, it, becomes, practically, impossible, to, fit, into, any, tune., As, with, any, problem,, the, best, thing, to, do, is, break, it, down,, so, I'm, going, to, stick, to, the, subject, of, a, single, solitary, static, chord., This, is, complex, enough..., There, are, obviously, clashing, chords, which, /do/, have, their, place, in, music, like, C,, F,, F#,, and, B, which, could, be, (say...), appropriate, for, a, scary, movie,, but..., try, these, out, on, your, music, keyboard, a, sec.., ;-), C#,, F,, C,, Eb,, F#,, Bb, ...or, this, beauty, ;-), D,, F#,, B,, Eb,, F,, C., Could, one, somehow, fit, these, chords, into, a, decent, tune, appropriately?, I, doubt, it..., Now, I'll, try, to, make, a, bad, chord, with, just, 5, notes..., E,, Ab,, C#,, F, and, Bb, All, these, above, chords, don't, just, simply, clash,, they, also, manage, to, be, extremely, dull,, ambiguous, and, generally, crud, ;-), It's, very, hard, to, make, a, bad, chord, with, just, 4, notes,, because, most, combinations, could, fit, in, /somehow/, to, a, tune, (i.e., resolve),, but, I've, tried:, F,, A,, C#,, Bb., ......or, maybe....., C,, Eb,, A,, C#, Hmmm..., that, was, harder, than, coming, up, with, a, /good/, chord, ;-), Actually,, it's, my, guess, that, these, two, chords, could, possibly, fit, into, a, tune, by, playing, briefly,, or, as, part, of, a, more, underlying, chord,, but, I, wouldn't, go, as, far, to, say, the, 6, note, chords, mentioned, earlier, could, do, this., OK,, now, take, this, stunner:, C#,, F#,, C,, Eb,, G,, Bb..., awful, huh?, But, just, lower, the, C, and, G, so, that, C, becomes, B, and, G, becomes, F#., A, bit, better, dontcha, think?, =), So, the, question, is, (and, I, know, this, will, only, explain, what's, good, about, a, /static/, chord),, why, is:, C#,, F#,, C,, Eb,, G,, Bb, much,, much, worse, than:, C#,, F#,, B,, Eb,, F#,, Bb, ?, ....with, the, overall, point, being, -, if, maths, can, explain, what's, good, and, bad, about, the, 2, simple, static, chords, as, shown, above, (which, by, the, way,, people, have, tried, to, do,, and, to, some, point, have, succeeded, a, little, -, there, are, whole, books, on, it!),, then, it, could, also, explain, /a, sequence/, of, chords,, eventually, going, on, to, explain, a, melody,, and, how, this, melody, interacts, with, the, accompanying, chords, and, how, /this/, interacts, with, rhythm, etc., etc., And, how, /all, these/, aspects, interact, with, the, 'sub-atomic', world, of, micro-second, music, (i.e., the, timbre/pitch, of, the, instruments/sounds, etc.)., It's, very,, very, complex,, which, is, why, no, formula, currently, exists., Amazing, also, how, despite, this, 'behind, the, scenes', complexity,, how, music, can, reach, our, emotions, and, affect, us, all, on, such, a, fundamental, level., To, ease, the, pain, of, those, ear-aching, earlier, chords,, here, are, just, two, of, my, fave, chords, using, six, notes:, C, and, deep, C, in, the, bass, followed, by, Bb, C, D, F, G, and, A, or:, C, and, deep, C, in, the, bass, followed, by, Bb, C#, E, G, and, A, "If, a, formula, did, exist, for, creating, the, best, music,, how, complex, would, it, be?", Take, chess., One, could, get, a, computer, to, analyse, a, particular, position, for, the, best, possible, move/s., There, isn't, any, 'easy', formula, -, it, has, to, laboriously, go, through, every, single, possible, move, branch, to, see, which, is, the, best, possible, continuation,, so, it's, (more, or, less), effectively, doing, what, a, human, does,, but, faster., Now, music,, is, a, million, times, more, complex, than, this, -, because, each, new, section, that, is, 'calculated', (if, such, a, thing, could, be, done),, would, have, to, be, cross-checked, with, every, part, of, the, tune, that, has, just, gone, by., Any, possible, program, to, create, good, music, would, probably, be, made, up, of, many, sub, formulas, (one, dedicated, to, the, melody,, one, for, the, harmony,, rhythm, etc., etc.), -, each, eventually, combining, and, 'growing', music, in, some, way, to, create, the, final, piece., I, believe, if, you, start, off, with, even, a, slightly, different, 'seed', of, music,, the, best, possible, continuation, would, continue, vastly, different, and, unexpectedly., Good, music, defined, Can, beauty, be, defined, or, even, measured?, Yes,, probably., We, just, don't, know, how., I, think, a, thorough, explanation, of, what, makes, good, music, would, be, almost, as, profound, to, know, as, how, the, universe, started, :), There, are, just, too, many, questions., But, anyway,, here's, my, attempt, to, define, musical, beauty, in, general., I, have, tried, my, best, to, make, these, criteria, as, universal, as, possible,, so, that, it, applies, to, all, music., No, doubt, I've, overlooked, a, few, ideas,, what, with, the, diversity, of, styles, and, possibilities, in, music..., Anyway,, here, goes., The, best, music, seems, to, have, the, following, properties, (with, most, important, at, the, top):, a), Music, with, timbre, based, around, the, harmonic, series,, where, the, best, timbres, tend, to, contain, 'clusters', of, harmonics,, and, 'evolving', harmonics., If, you, look, at, the, spectroscopic, analysis, of, a, sound, in, say..., Cool, Edit, Pro,, you'll, find, the, best, instruments, or, sounds, have, 'nicer, looking', and, more, 'logical', patterns., Yes,, I, know., This, just, pushes, the, problem, further, out,, but, it's, the, best, I, can, do, for, now., b), Music, based, around, a, scale, of, 12, equal, spaced, notes, to, the, octave, (for, the, underlying, harmony, and, melody)., c), Chord, sequences, that, are, good., This, is, hard, to, define, or, pin, down,, but, it's, somehow, related, to, the, tonal, 'hierarchy'., The, human, soul, knows, when, a, chord, sounds, good,, and, authors, have, written, whole, books, on, the, subject,, but, we're, still, far, away, from, explaining, it, all!, d), Chords, and, melodies, approaching, 'atonal', could, break, up, some, sections, and, chord, sequences, for, contrast,, but, generally, the, best, music, will, be, 'more, or, less', tonal, in, my, opinion., Similiarly,, a, good, dose, of, musical, dissonance, is, a, good, thing,, as, long, as, it's, carefully, balanced, out, with, the, degree, of, consonance., e), In, good, music,, a, small, section, taken, from, the, whole, is, amazing, too, (for, example,, zooming, into, a, picture, would, reveal, a, new, and, 'different', picture;, and, that, as, part, of, the, whole,, it, still, fits, in, appropriately)., Also,, slowing, a, tune, down, with, a, significant, amount, of, (fast, playing), detail, will, often, still, provide, a, pleasurable, listening, experience., f), Related, to, the, above,, fractal-like, patterns, to, the, tune, are, essential., A, good, example, is, the, beat,, where, a, relatively, faint, hi-hat, will, sound, every, beat,, but, more, prominent, percussion, (such, as, a, snare,, or, bass-drum), will, sound, every, 2, or, 4, beats., A, nice, big, 'smash', could, sound, every, 16, beats., This, example, is, only, a, very, limited, view, of, the, whole, picture, of, course., Generally, speaking,, structures, and, (some), consistent, patterns, are, vital., Also, see, I, and, L., g), Rich, and, numerous, layers, of, contrapuntal, melody,, but, perhaps, with, more, 'solo-esque', textures, elsewhere, in, the, tune, for, contrast, (for, example,, at, the, beginning,, so, as, to, allow, for, a, feeling, of, crescendo)., Two,, three,, or, more, simultaneous, melody, lines, (polyphony), will, add, tremendously, if, done, well., h), Melodies, or, chords, that, smoothly, flow, from, note, to, note, via, semi, or, whole, tones,, with, relatively, few, 'big', jumps., These, would, tend, to, fit, in, with, the, underlying, or, implied, chord, at, that, point, in, the, tune., Broken, chords, (for, example, in, Moonlight, Sonata), might, count, as, seperate, melody, lines,, so, that, would, explain, the, constant, 'big, jumps'., I, know,, quite, vague, -, your, mileage, may, vary., i), Hooks, and, motifs, are, paramount., A, hook, or, motif, is, a, 'piece', of, melody,, perhaps, a, bar, or, two,, which, recurs, (or, 'echoes', upon, itself),, afterwards, in, the, very, same, bar,, or, perhaps, later, in, the, tune., Or, it, might, repeat, later, on,, but, in, subtlely, different, ways, (with, for, a, example,, a, note, higher, or, lower), -, so, as, to, fit, into, the, new, chord/key, structure., Also, see, F., j), Dynamics, in, the, tune, help, to, provide, contrast, and, variety., Anything, from, a, single, bar, to, a, whole, movement, could, be, quieter,, slower,, faster, or, louder, than, the, rest., Or, you, could, have, every, second, or, third, note, being, quieter/louder, than, the, others., Again,, we're, going, back, to, fractal, territory, here..., k), The, cadences, of, excellent, melodies, usually, have, 'something', about, them., For, example,, a, crescendo,, richening, of, the, chord/s,, effect, (such, as, a, bass/melody, slide),, drum, 'fill-in',, melody, 'embellishment',, a, new, temporary, instrument, etc., etc., l), A, 'beat'., It, doesn't, necessarily, have, to, be, a, snare/drum/hi-hat, beat,, but, whatever, it, takes, to, keep, the, tempo, each, bar., A, more, general, description, would, be, a, quick-changing, dynamic-volume, sound, effect., But, I, have, heard, 'beats', (or, more, like, 'sounds'), which, can, last, the, duration, of, the, bar, and, still, sound, effective., Also, see, F., m), Lots, of, cool, and, unusual, sound, FX, and, synthesizer, sounds, :), n), Tailored, timbre, according, to, each, note, (something, virtually, no, music, has, to, any, significant, degree)., Anyway,, assuming, the, best, sounds,, chord, sequences,, and, rhythms, could, also, be, calculated, (other, variables/dimensions, adding, to, the, confusion),, these, would, also, have, to, be, cross-checked, with, the, tunes', history, -, because, unlike, a, chess, game, (where, the, previous, moves/positions, don't, matter, any, more),, every, part, of, a, piece, of, music, is, inextricably, linked, with, every, other, part., The, mind, (sub)consciously, picks, this, up, 'on, the, fly', when, listening, to, music, -, and, it's, part, of, what, makes, it, so, amazing., So, basically,, I, think, that, even, if, a, formula, was, found,, not, even, the, fastest, super, computers, would, compose, a, decent, melody, for, ages, and, ages, and, ages..., Are, intricate/complex, tunes, better, than, simple, ones?, Difficult, question., First, off,, I'm, defining, 'simple', as, a, tune, which, is, unadventurous, in, its, use, of, chords, and/or, rhythms., The, short, answer, is, yes., The, long, answer, is, tricky, because, there, could, be, many, simple, tunes, that, are, 'perfect', to, a, limited, extent., To, put, it, another, way,, a, perfectly, formed, 'simple', tune, still, has, something, the, perfect, 'complex', tune, doesn't, have,, but, with, the, complex, tune, obviously, being, better, overall, (naturally,, if, the, complex, tune, has, too, many, flaws,, this, might, be, enough, to, make, it, inferior, to, the, simple, tune, anyway)., The, best, analogy, I, can, think, of, is, comparing, the, simplicity, of, a, sphere, to, the, complexity, of, a, beautifully, intricate, design, (made, up, of, many, shapes)., The, intricate, design, is, better, overall,, but, it, still, lacks, something, that, the, simple, (light, sourced), sphere, has, got., And, then, if, this, intricate, design, were, to, be, distorted, so, that, randomness, and, illogical, shape, crept, in,, this, might, well, be, enough, to, make, the, simple, sphere, better, in, both, senses., One, other, point, to, bear, in, mind, is, that, the, more, complex, one, tries, to, make, a, tune,, the, more, likely, errors, (either, in, the, melody, or, orchestration), are, going, to, creep, in., For, those, who, are, interested, (and, even, for, those, who, aren't, ;P, ),, you, can, hear, my, music, at, the, Soundburst, Shrine., See, if, you, like, it!, =), Further, comments,, thoughts, and, possibilities, At, the, moment,, only, people, can, really, create, decent, melodies, -, and, I, suspect, it, will, stay, that, way, for, a, long, time, to, come., But, imagine, some, kind, of, 'super-brain', or, future, super-computer, -, the, music, equivalent, of, the, chess, program, 'Deep, Blue', -, only, much, better., One, could, ask, it, all, sorts, of, questions, such, as:, What's, the, best, possible, melody, for, a, 6, note, tune?, ...or, a, 60, note, tune?, ......or, either, of, these, with, say...., 2,, 4, or, 10, simultaneous, melodies, (contrapuntal, melody, or, 'counterpoint')., Imagine, how, exciting, that, would, be, -, finding, the, incredible, results, that, this, supreme, formula, would, produce!, Then, one, could, have, more, fun, by:, ...Seeing, what, piece/s, of, music, would, fit, best, to, a, certain, rhythm, -, say..., 6/8, time., ...Restricting, the, formula, so, that, certain, notes, couldn't, be, played,, or, that, the, tune, always, had, to, be, in, harmony, with, a, particular, note, -, and, see, what, the, best, tune, would, sound, like, then., ...Limiting, the, length, of, each, note, so, that, no, one, note, lasts, longer, than, a, quarter, of, a, second., No, doubt, a, very, intricate, staccato, styled, tune, would, result., All, of, these, would, probably, make, the, tune, 'averagely, worse', in, some, way,, but, it, would, be, of, great, interest, to, hear, the, interesting, 'styles', and, 'musical, surprises', that, would, come, from, these, 'filtering', techniques., Art, aesthetics, What, of, graphics,, pictures,, artwork, and, moving, pictures?", Is, there, a, definition, of, aesthetics?, In, the, same, way, music, can, be, empirically, rated, on, its, various, aspects,, pictures, can, also, be, given, a, definitive, value, or, values., In, my, experience,, the, best, pictures, contain, wide, use, of, the, full, palette, of, colours, in, the, spectrum, (including, the, brightest, hues)., Also,, just, like, the, best, music,, pictures, which, have, repeating, and, evolving, patterns, (rather, than, solitary, or, non-evolving), should, be, held, in, higher, regard., Goodness, knows, what, defines, a, 'good, pattern',, but, the, best, pictures, probably, contain, a, lot, of, them, :), Other, aspects, I, have, found, which, make, good, pictures, (and, the, same, could, be, applied, to, music), are:, a:, symmetry, &, fractal, like, qualities, b:, gradual, contours, of, patterns, c:, many, varieties, of, pattern, d:, colour, graduation, e:, luminous,, translucent, and, subtle, colours., f:, high, detail/complexity, g:, '3D', scenario,, so, that, there's, a, combination, of, big, and, 'small', objects., This, last, one, is, interesting., It, assumes, that, the, best, pictures, contain, simple, (foreground), and, complex, (background), designs, (...of, course,, the, 'simple', foreground, could, still, be, subtly, complex, by, the, way)., In, fact,, it's, closely, related, to, the, 'fractal', aspect., How, should, one, go, about, the, huge, task, of, 'rating', a, picture, though?, What, criteria, would, be, involved, and, what, are, the, 'elements', of, the, picture?, You, might, want, to, visit, my, Rating, Art, page., This, was, specially, done, for, a, web, site, forum, I, frequent,, but, its, principles, would, apply, universally., One, important, point, is, that, any, implied, meaning, behind, a, picture, is, a, separate, aspect, from, the, actual, design, (shapes/lines/contours/colours), of, the, picture., This, isn't, to, say, that, the, meaning, or, 'story', or, 'expression', behind, doesn't, add, something,, but, one, could, equate, it, to, adding, lyrics, to, music,, or, background, music, to, a, TV, film, -, or, even, pleasant, smells, to, a, shop, (i.e., effectively, multimedia)., Just, like, with, music,, the, most, intricate, and, ultimately, beautiful, artistic, designs, do, not, have, to, rely, on, apparent, 'meaning', to, justify, their, beauty., A, (mathematical), formula, for, graphics?, There, is, no, strict, art, aesthetics, definition,, at, least, not, for, the, foreseeable, future,, but, who, knows;, one, day,, we, might, start, unravelling, the, mathematical, mysteries, of, good, art..., If, a, static, picture, wasn't, complex, enough, to, determine, its, quality, -, how, about, an, animation?, Wow,, I, think, I'd, best, stop, there, ;-), Final, note, I, believe, music, and, art, are, so, complex, and, wonderful, that, we'll, never, find, a, 'magic, formula', for, creating, the, best, of, either,, but, maybe, we'll, edge, closer., This, doesn't, mean, an, (undiscovered), formula, doesn't, exist, which, couldn't, do, this, of, course., And, no, doubt,, I, believe, there's, a, whole, range, of, 'best, tunes', or, 'best, pictures', that, are, utterly, different, from, each, other,, all, of, which, are, unique, and, amazing,, and, where, the, 'magic, formula', possibly, explains, them, all., I, imagine, any, possible, 'formula', to, create, the, best, music/art, would, need, to, contain, numerous, concepts, or, sub-formulas, working, in, conjunction., This, is, similar, to, the, solving, of, Fermat's, last, theorem,, where, the, combination, of, known, mathematical, concepts, and, entirely, new, ideas, were, put, together, to, finally, solve, the, problem., If, there, is, one, thing, that, I, have, found, in, common, with, the, best, pictures, and, music,, it's, that, a, small, section, taken, from, the, whole, is, amazing, too, (for, example,, zooming, into, a, picture, would, reveal, a, new, and, 'different', picture;, and, that, as, part, of, the, whole,, it, still, fits, in, appropriately)., I, hope, you, have, enjoyed, reading, this, article, as, much, as, I, have, enjoyed, writing, it., Please, email, your, thoughts, on, this, text, -, I'd, love, to, hear, from, you!, Alternatively,, message, your, comments, and, stir, up, some, debate, on, the, Skytopia, Forum., Aesthetics, Survey, -, submit, your, votes, So, what, do, you, believe?, Has, this, article, made, you, think, about, music, and, aesthetics, in, general?, Why, not, take, the, time, to, fill, in, this, questionnaire...., There, are, just, 10, questions, in, total, and, you, will, be, able, to, submit, comments, at, the, end, if, you, wish., 1:, Can, music, go, much, further, in, terms, of, quality, and, enjoyment, than, even, the, best, tunes, composed, thus, far?, Yes1, -, music, could, exist, and, be, indescribably, better, than, anyone, has, made, or, heard, so, far, Yes2, -, there's, a, lot, of, room, for, improvement, for, even, the, best, tunes, ever, composed, Yes3, -, a, bit, -, there, could, certainly, be, room, for, improvement, for, the, even, the, best, tunes, Nah, -, all, the, best, music, has, already, been, thought, up, or, is, at, least, close, Irrelevant, -, as, all, tunes, are, ultimately, as, good, as, each, other, since, I, believe, in, the, relative, aesthetic, theory, 2:, Do, some, people, have, better, taste, in, music, than, others, (veering, heavily, towards, the, Universal/Objective, aesthetics, music, theory), -, or, is, every, person's, opinion, about, music, equally, valid, (veering, heavily, towards, Relative/Subjective, Aesthetics, music, theory), ?, Yes, -, some, people, have, better, or, worse, taste, in, music, than, others, No, -, everyone's, opinion, on, music, is, equally, valid, as, everyone, else's, Sort, of, -, only, certain, aspects, in, music, can, anyone, claim, to, have, better, or, worse, taste, I, haven't, the, foggiest, I, don't, know, precisely, what, you, mean, 3:, Do, you, believe, in, a, 'universal, aesthetic', as, this, article, promotes?, Yes, -, even, if, no-one, knows, for, sure, how, good, any, tune, is,, it, still, has, a, 'rating', No, -, the, quality, of, a, piece, of, music, is, subjective, and, each, opinion, is, equally, as, valid, Sort, of, -, maybe, some, if, not, all, aspects, of, music, are, 'ratable', I, don't, know, precisely, what, you, mean, I, haven't, the, foggiest, 4:, Do, you, believe, we, have, a, 'soul'?, Do, you, think, the, appreciation, of, music, transcends, the, 'physical', brain, and, perhaps, reaches, into, the, metaphysical, realm?, Yes, -, all, or, most, musical, enjoyment, is, derived, once, the, music, reaches, the, soul., The, ear, and, brain, only, mostly, act, as, a, transmitter, Kind, of, -, the, brain, interprets, the, sound, and, translates, a, new, signal, to, be, sent, to, the, soul, Hmmmm, -, 'on, the, fly', calculation, of, the, music, is, probably, only, performed, in, the, brain., I'm, not, too, sure, about, a, soul, No, -, everything, is, limited, to, electromagnetic, activity, inside, the, brain., I, somewhat, doubt, a, 'soul', really, exists, No, -, everything, is, limited, to, electromagnetic, activity, inside, the, brain., There's, definitely, no, such, thing, as, a, transcendental, 'soul', I, haven't, the, foggiest, 5:, Has, this, article, made, you, think, twice, that, music, can, be, objectively, rated, (Universal, aesthetics, theory), ?, Not, applicable, -, as, I, already, believe, in, Universal, Aesthetics, Yes, -, I, now, think, there's, a, very, good, chance, it, might, be, true, No, -, I, still, think, the, Relative, or, Subjective, Aesthetics, view, to, be, true, Sort, of, -, I, certainly, see, some, valid, points, you, have, made, that, supports, Universal, Aesthetics, I, didn't, really, consider, it, before, -, but, I, don't, really, agree, and, therefore, I, believe, in, Relative, Aesthetics, I, didn't, really, consider, it, before2, -, but, your, article, makes, sense, and, I, therefore, believe, in, Universal, Aesthetics, 6:, Assuming, the, above, is, true, (that, there, really, is, a, universal, aesthetic),, could, there, be, such, thing, as, a, perfect, piece, of, music?, Yes, -, a, perfect, tune, really, exists, and, is, waiting, to, be, discovered, No, -, there, are, an, infinite, number, of, 'perfect', tunes, Sort, of, -, maybe, a, finite, number, of, equally, perfect, tunes, exist, No2, -, and, this, question, is, irrelevant, as, I, only, believe, in, subjective, aesthetics, I, haven't, the, foggiest, 7:, Going, one, step, further, than, the, Universal, Aesthetics, music, theory,, could, the, best, (most, satisfying), music, ever, be, explained, via, a, mathematical, formula, of, sorts?, Yes, -, a, very, complex, undiscovered, math, formula, could, explain, the, best, music, Well, yes, -, but, maths, and, science, will, probably, never, be, able, to, come, close, to, explaining, the, best, music, No, -, math, formulas, and, science, could, not, explain, music, Sort, of, -, certain, aspects, in, music, could, be, reductionable, -, but, not, all, Yes2, -, but, since, I, believe, in, Subjective, Aesthetics,, any, possible, formula, would, need, to, different, for, every, person, No2, -, since, I, believe, in, Subjective, Aesthetics,, and, I, don't, think, this, is, compatible, I, haven't, the, foggiest, I, don't, know, precisely, what, you, mean, 8:, Can, art, and, pictures, also, fit, into, the, Universal, Aesthetic, theory?, Yes, -, even, if, no-one, knows, for, sure,, all, pictures, have, a, 'rating', No, -, the, quality, of, a, picture, is, subjective, and, each, opinion, is, equally, as, valid, Sort, of, -, maybe, some, if, not, all, aspects, of, pictures, are, 'ratable', I, don't, know, precisely, what, you, mean, I, haven't, the, foggiest, 9:, Almost, there., How, interesting, did, you, find, this, whole, article?, Utterly, absorbing, Fascinating, Fairly, interesting, A, bit, boring, Who, cares, about, aesthetics, anyway, 10:, Finally,, do, you, think, God, exists?, Definitely, Most, likely, Possibly, Possibly, -, but, I, doubt, it, Most, likely, not, Definitely, not, I,
