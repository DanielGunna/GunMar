0-691-08813-6., Reviewed, by, Stanley, Bates,, Middlebury, College, A, reviewer’s, first, obligation, should, be, to, convey, some, sense, of, what, the, general, line, of, argument, of, a, book, is,, and, then, to, respond, both, to, that, overall, line, of, thought, and, to, at, least, some, of, its, specific, parts., Jane, Bennett’s, The, Enchantment, of, Modern, Life, poses, difficult, problems, for, both, of, those, tasks., The, specific, parts, of, the, book, are, so, various,, so, interesting, (and,, sometimes,, so, contestable), that, one, wishes, to, respond, to, all, of, them., At, the, same, time,, that, sheer, variety, makes, it, exceedingly, difficult, to, discern, a, line, of, thought,, or, a, thesis,, that, unifies, the, entire, work., If, there, is, a, unifying, idea,, it, would, have, to, be, that, expressed, in, the, title—enchantment,, so, this, concept, deserves, our, initial, attention., Perhaps, the, best, way, to, begin, to, describe, Bennett’s, use, of, “enchantment”, is, to, note, that, she, is, really, writing, a, story, of, anti-disenchantment., She, takes, the, dominant, interpretation, of, modernity,, at, least, in, social, science,, to, be, a, narrative, of, disenchantment, (with, Max, Weber’s, theorizing, providing, a, convenient, paradigm, which, she, discusses, in, detail.), Thus,, the, general, secularizing, of, belief, and, culture, which, has, taken, place, over, the, past, several, hundred, years, is, characterized, for, her, by, two, images,, “The, first, is, the, image, of, modernity, as, disenchanted,, that, is, to, say,, as, a, place, of, dearth, and, alienation, (when, compared, to, a, golden, age, of, community, and, cosmological, coherency), or, a, place, of, reason,, freedom,, and, control, (when, compared, to, a, dark, and, confused, premodernity).”(p., 3), Her, idea, is, that, the, characterization, of, the, world, as, disenchanted, may, “discourage, affective, attachment, to, the, world”, and, be, destructive, to, the, possibility, of, ethical, life., Hence,, her, counter-story, is, to, call, attention, to, the, way, the, world, is, (or, “can, be, experienced, as”--we’ll, return, to, this, distinction), enchanted,, and, to, suggest, that, experiencing, such, “enchantment”, might, make, one, more, open, to, the, appreciation, and, concern, for, others, (including, non-human, others), that, would, make, possible, the, affective, incorporation, of, morality, in, human, life., Her, technique, in, the, book, is, not, exactly, to, argue, for, this, general, position,, but, rather, to, recount, stories, of, disenchantment, and, then, to, counter, them, with, descriptions, of, “sites”, of, enchantment., Her, initial, description, of, enchantment, overlaps, some, of, the, traditional, description, of, aesthetic, experience., Here, are, a, few, of, her, many, descriptive, phrases:, “To, be, enchanted, is, to, be, struck, and, shaken, by, the, extraordinary, that, lives, amid, the, familiar…,”, “enchantment, entails, a, state, of, wonder…,”, “fear…, plays, a, role, in, enchantment,”, “enchantment, involves, a, surprising, encounter…”, Enchantment, contains, both, pleasure, and, a, feeling, of, the, uncanny., One, doesn’t, need, to, demand, necessary, and, sufficient, conditions, for, the, application, of, the, concept, of, enchantment,, but, the, concept, is, pretty, protean, as, Bennett, employs, it., At, the, most, abstract, level,, it, seems, to, encompass, all, of, the, ways, in, which, human, beings, can, enjoyably, experience, their, presentness, to, the, world—but, if, this, is, enchantment,, who, has, ever, denied, its, existence?, The, disenchantment, of, the, world, tales, had, a, particular, content., What, was, gone, (for, intellectuals), was, religion—both, traditional, folk, religion, and, Christianity., The, “meaning, of, life”, had, been, understood, within, the, framework, of, religious, belief., Bennett, calls, this, a, “teleological, model, of, enchantment.”, She, seems, to, agree, with, the, promoters, of, the, disenchantment, thesis, that, such, a, teleological, model, is, no, longer, viable., What, she, seeks, to, develop, is, a, non-teleological, understanding, of, enchantment, (something, she, later, calls, “an, enchanted, materialism.”), The, vocabulary, may, be, a, bit, unfamiliar,, but, surely, the, project, isn’t., This, is, more, or, less, the, project, of, Romanticism—it, might, be, titled, by, the, phrase, of, Carlyle’s, that, M.L, Abrams, used, for, his, great, study, of, Romanticism:, Natural, Supernaturalism., It, is,, more, or, less,, the, project, of, Nietzsche:, the, revaluation, of, all, values, in, the, face, of, the, death, of, God., However,, she, is, much, less, ambitious, than, these, precursors., She, presents, her, insights, as, part, of, what, she, calls, a, weak, ontology, (adapting, the, phrase, from, Stephen, White.), One, who, presents, such, a, weak, ontology, “emphasizes, the, necessarily, speculative, and, contestable, character, of, [the]…, onto-story,, and, thus, does, not, try, to, demonstrate, its, truth, in, any, strong, sense.”, (p., 161), Presumably, then,, any, contesting, of, her, “ontological, assumptions”, has, already, been, disarmed, by, her, own, acknowledgment, that, they, are, contestable., If, her, claims, for, enchantment, do, not, rest, on, argument,, perhaps, they, should, be, understood, as, invitations, to, reflect, on, elements, of, one’s, own, experience, in, relation, to, the, stories, she, recounts., The, various, chapters, of, this, book, after, the, introduction, are, then, related, to, each, other, not, as, parts, of, a, developing, argument, but, as, a, series, of, essays, on, various, facets, of, enchantment, as, Bennett, understands, it., Chapter, 2,, “Cross-Species, Encounters”,, presents, a, number, of, stories,, some, fictional,, some, professedly, non-fictional,, of, species-boundary, crossings., Chapter, 3, contrasts, the, “teleological”, enchantment, story, of, Paracelsus,, to, the, still, “marvelous”,, but, non-teleological,, worlds, in, the, theories, (or, stories), of, Kant, and, Deleuze., Chapter, 4, presents,, and, responds, to,, a, series, of, “disenchantment, tales”, by, Max, Weber,, Hans, Blumenberg,, and, Simon, Critchley., (Bennett’s, talent, for, graceful, summary, and, paraphrase, makes, this, an, especially, informative, and, useful, chapter.), Chapter, 5,, “Complexity, and, Enchantment”,, discusses, some, aspects, of, Thoreau’s, thought, about, nature,, and, Bruno, Latour’s, analysis, of, that, thought., (Bennett, has, written, a, book, on, Thoreau, and, her, deep, acquaintance, with, his, work,, and, thoughtful, reflection, on, it,, are, enlightening.), Chapter, 6, is, an, attempt, to, find, a, possible, source, of, enchantment, in, some, commercial, advertisements., In, order, to, do, this,, she, feels, required, to, respond, to, theoretical, critiques, of, commodity, fetishism, in, Marx,, and, in, Horkheimer, and, Adorno., This, is, required, because, she, is, sympathetic, to, various, political, and, environmental, critiques, of, modern, capitalism,, but, she, still, wants, to, account, for, the, way, that, she, finds, enchantment, in, a, Gap, television, commercial., Chapter, 7, involves, a, discussion, of, the, relationship, of, enchantment, (as, a, kind, of, aesthetic, dimension), to, moral, theory., This, involves, an, interesting, discussion, of, the, relationship, of, Kant, to, Schiller,, and,, more, generally,, of, the, role, of, moral, sentiment, in, moral, theory., However,, her, own, account, of, the, role, of, this, aesthetic, dimension, is, that, it, has, a, much, weaker, role, than, Schiller, held., The, concluding, Chapter, 8, presents, her, account, of, her, work, as, the, presentation, of, a, weak, ontology., This, summary, of, the, book’s, contents, omits, many, of, her, discussions, of, other, thinkers, and, of, “sites”, of, enchantment,, but, it, is, perhaps, sufficient, to, give, an, idea, of, how, variegated, the, parts, of, this, book, are., I, can, only, respond, briefly, to, a, few, of, the, many, points, that, she, makes., I, should, perhaps, begin, by, saying, that, I, am, sympathetic, to, many, of, the, anti-disenchantment, sentiments., However,, at, many, places, in, the, book,, the, question, arises:, who, has, denied, what, Bennett, wants, to, assert?, If, her, crucial, claim, is, that, human, beings, can, have, aesthetic, experience,, love, life,, say, yes, to, existence,, live, in, the, moment, etc.,, then, it’s, not, clear, from, the, beginning, why, ordinary, materialists, would, have, to, deny, that, claim., She, seems, to, think, that, her, “enchanted, materialism”, is, necessary, to, rescue, us, from, the, nihilistic, implications, of, the, development, of, the, modern, scientific, worldview,, but, most, of, those, who, accept, such, a, view, are, not, nihilists., Maybe, they, already, accept, the, reality, of, a, lot, of, what, she, calls, “enchantment”., The, question, is:, what, is, Bennett, claiming, when, she, asserts, the, reality, of, enchantment., One, interpretation, of, enchantment, would, be, that, it, is, grounded, in, a, subjective, human, response, to, the, world;, it, is, a, possible, aspect, of, human, experience, of, the, world., (This, would, be, subjective, in, the, sense, that, enchantment, would, necessarily, be, grounded, in, the, experiencing, subject., This, is, roughly, what, Hutcheson, claimed, about, “beauty”, in, the, 18th, century.), An, alternative, would, be, to, claim, that, the, world, is, enchanted—that, enchantment, is, a, characteristic, in, the, world, independent, of, the, human, experience, of, it., The, major, problem, I, find, in, the, text, is, that, Bennett, often, says, thing, that, sound, like, the, latter, interpretation,, but, nothing, she, presents, supports, anything, but, the, former., Of, course,, the, former, interpretation, is, entirely, adequate, to, support, her, (weak), claims, for, the, relationship, of, enchantment, to, the, ethical, life., Let, me, pursue, this, with, some, examples., In, her, Chapter, “Crossings, and, Enchantments,”, Bennett, presents, a, list, of, “metamorphing, creatures”, to, which, she, responds, with, wonder, (presumably, a, form, of, enchantment.), She, then, discusses, some, of, the, members, of, the, list, in, detail., Here, is, the, list,, “the, criminal, fiend, Catwoman, …the, oceanic, woman, in, Luce, Irigaray’s, Marine, Lover…, the, strategic, insects, in, the, 1996, documentary, Microcosmos, …the, porcine, star, of, George, Miller’s, 1995, film, Babe, …Andoar,, the, goat-kite, in, Michel, Tournier’s, Friday, …Deleuze’s, and, Guattari’s, body-without-organs, …Deep, Blue,, the, machine-self, who, beat, former, chess, champion, Kaparov, …Rotpeter,, Kafka’s, ape-man, …Alex,, an, African, Grey, parrot, learning, to, use, abstract, concepts, …the, technonatural, creatures, called, fractals, …Dolly,, the, cloned, sheep.”, Notice, the, disparities, of, this, list, of, 11, items., There, are, real, things, on, the, list:, Deep, Blue,, Alex,, fractals, and, Dolly., (The, insects, in, Microcosmos, are, certainly, real, but, the, context, of, the, narrative, structure, of, the, film, complicates, this, example.), All, the, others, are, fictional, or, fantasy, creatures., They, are, certainly, examples, of, the, fecundity, of, human, imagination., They, might, be, enchanting, to, an, audience., It, might, be, revelatory, of, the, human, psyche, to, develop, a, theoretical, account, of, why, certain, genres, of, fantasy, have, been, capable, of, “enchanting”, people., However,, there, is, no, ’enchanted, materialism’, to, be, drawn, from, them., Of, the, real, things, on, the, list,, the, only, one, discussed, in, detail, by, Bennett, is, the, case, of, the, parrot, Alex, who, is, “learning”, to, use, abstract, concepts., She, shows, no, caution, in, accepting, this, example, despite, the, long, history, of, human, misattribution, of, reason, and, logic, to, higher, animals., However,, let, us, accept, that, the, parrot, can, do, what, is, claimed, for, it., Wouldn’t, this, then, be, just, another, fact, about, the, world?, The, enchantment, of, the, example, (if, one, found, it, enchanting), would, then, be, a, human,, subjective, response, to, this, fact., Why, would, the, fantasy, of, crossing, species, boundaries, be,, in, itself,, enchanting?, (Once,, hiking, in, the, high, desert, in, California,, I, encountered, a, very, still, coyote, at, a, distance, of, about, 15, feet,, and, we, stared, at, each, other, for, almost, a, minute., The, enchantment, of, that, encounter, for, me, seemed, determined, by, the, sheer, specificity, of, that, other, being,, which, was, crossing, no, species, boundary)., Bennett’s, discussions, of, the, fictional, cases, all, treat, them, as, though, they, were, real—as, though, they, really, demonstrated, the, mobility, of, identity., She, then, seems, to, think, that, she, has, given, examples, of, realities, that, would, count, against, disenchantment, tales., No, doubt, she, is, perfectly, aware, of, the, fictional, status, of, these, cases,, but, why, discuss, them, as, though, they, were, real?, Let, me, give, another, example, of, Bennett’s, discussion, of, a, topic, about, which, the, status, of, her, claims, is, unclear, to, me., She, discusses,, in, several, places, in, the, book,, her, interpretation, of, Epicurean, atomism., An, early, comment, is, “I, find, in, pagan, atomism, the, resources, for, a, view, of, matter, as, wondrous,, for, a, materialism, that, is, enchanting, without, being, teleological, or, purposive.”, (p., 73), She, then, characterizes, the, physics, of, Epicurus, and, Lucretius, as, holding, that, the, world, consists, “of, tiny, but, active,, alert,, and, highly, mobile, particles, called, ’primordia’“, which, “are, not, animate, with, divine, spirit,, and, yet, they, are, quite, animated—this, matter, is, not, dead, at, all.”, (pp.80-81), There, is, first, the, question, of, textual, interpretation., Do, Epicurus, and, Lucretius, really, hold, that, the, fundamental, particles, are, “alert”, and, “animate”?, (Lucretius, writes, “whatever, is, seen, to, be, sentient, is, nevertheless, composed, of, atoms, that, are, insentient, …the, animate, is, born,, as, I, maintain,, of, the, insentient.”, On, the, Nature, of, the, Universe., (Penguin), p., 85., Hence,, he, seems, to, maintain, that, complex, entities, have, emergent, properties.), However,, suppose, we, accept, Bennett’s, interpretation, of, ancient, atomism., In, what, sense, does, it, provide, a, “resource”, for, anything, unless, we, believe, that, it, is, true?, Of, course,, I, think, a, highly, plausible, argument, could, be, made, that, the, view, of, matter, embodied, in, contemporary, sub-atomic, physics, is, certainly, not, that, it, is, dead, or, inert., Quarks, don’t, seem, at, all, like, “matter”, as, say, the, actual, Lucretius, or, Hobbes, or, Gassendi, characterized, matter., Perhaps, Bennett, means, to, subsume, all, the, features, of, matter, as, understood, in, contemporary, physics, as, a, version, of, the, “swerve”, in, ancient, atomism,, but, she, doesn’t, make, that, argument., A, related, issue, is, raised, by, her, discussion, of, agency, in, her, presentation, of, her, “enchanted, materialism.”, Bennett, writes,, “I, first, broaden, the, sense, of, what, agency, means, to, cover, the, ability, to, make, a, difference, in, the, world, without, knowing, exactly, what, you, are, doing,, and, I, project, this, agency, as, distributed,, to, varying, degrees,, to, atoms, that, move,, plants, that, engage, their, environment,, and, animals, that, communicate,, as, well, as, humans, …”, (p., 163), Once, again,, the, issue, is, what, is, being, claimed., Does, Bennett, believe, that, atoms, are, “agents”, in, the, same, sense, the, human, beings, are, “agents”?, That, just, seems, to, be, false., (Do, we, believe, that, “there, is, something, that, it, is, like”, to, be, an, atom?), Or,, is, the, claim, that, we, can, project, agency, onto, atoms, (that, is, fantasize, that, they, are, living, agents)?, The, latter, is, certainly, true,, and, interesting,, and, no, doubt, an, enchanting, fiction, could, be, based, on, such, a, fantasy., Why, can’t, one, find, enchantment, in, the, actual, world, as, we, find, it, in, perception, and, as, it, is, presented, in, our, best, hypotheses, about, it, in, science?, Science, doesn’t, have, to, be, reductionist, (though, no, doubt, even, some, good, scientists, are.), It, is, as, though, Bennett, thinks, that, science, must, be, reductionist, (i.e., roughly, to, conform, to, the, view, of, science, of, Logical, Positivism.), and, that, therefore, she, must, attribute, life/action/enchantment, to, the, ground, level,, in, order, for, it, to, be, theoretically, available, at, higher, levels, of, complexity., There, are, real, distinctions, to, be, drawn, between, the, inorganic, and, the, organic,, between, plants, and, animals,, between, humans, and, other, animals,, even, though, all, of, these, are, bound, up, together, in, a, single, interactive, reality, with, each, other., Moreover,, such, distinctions, don’t, need, to, be, incompatible, with, the, core, of, what, Bennett, calls, enchantment., There, is, much, more, to, say, about, this, book,, and, no, space, to, say, it., The, book, is, provocative, in, a, good, sense,, and, most, readers, will, find, both, interesting, discussions, of, topics, and, materials,, and, information, on, many, topics, unfamiliar, to, them, because, of, the, breadth, of, Bennett’s, reading., Her, discussion, of, the, relation, of, enchantment, to, ethics, is, enlightening,, and, raises, an, important, set, of, issues,, which, are, often, ignored, in, contemporary, ethical, theory., About, Recent, Reviews, Review, Archive,
