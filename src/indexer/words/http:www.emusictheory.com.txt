Welcome, David, Crane, to, eMusicTheory!, We're, collaborating, to, gradually, rebuild, the, eMusicTheory, drills, with, more, modern,, flexible, tech., The, new, drills, don't, need, Java, installed,, can, work, on, iOS, and, Chromebooks,, and, will, let, us, get, back, to, expanding, the, drills., Try, out, the, new, note, names, and, intervals, drills!, Feedback, (and, bug, reports), welcome,, of, course., We'll, be, adding, them, as, options, for, assignments, soon,, along, with, new, versions, of, all, of, the, other, drills, as, well., |, 19, August,, 2015, |, Website, updates:, *, update, about, page, to, show, eMusicTheory, is, in, stable, maintenance, mode,, with, only, occasional, development, for, the, time, being, *, note, that, MIDI, input, on, OS, X, seems, to, be, broken, (seeking, workarounds), |, 4, September,, 2011, |, Drill, updates:, *, added, some, drill, versions, in, bass, and, alto, clefs:, key, signatures, in, alto, clef,, and, chord, functions, in, both, alto, and, bass, clefs, *, a, few, bugfixes, to, handling, of, MIDI, input, *, paced, note, names:, smoother, animation, *, key, signatures:, bugfix, when, supporting, minor, keys, *, changed, audio, in, alto, clef, to, use, viola, audio,, not, piano, *, note, names, and, paced, note, names:, bugfix, in, choosing, notes, to, test, *, better, options, shortcuts, for, key, signatures, (in, drills, that, use, them),, and, particularly, the, key, signatures, drill, Website, updates:, *, redesigned, student, view, of, assignments:, clarify, what's, done, vs., what's, next, or, due, soon, *, updated, order, form, to, cover, submitting, purchase, orders, by, email, More, updates, on, the, way;, as, usual,, let, us, know, if, you, run, into, any, problems, using, new, features., |, 11, August,, 2011, |, Knocked, offline, by, a, power, outage:, Apologies!, The, data, center, that, hosts, eMusicTheory.com, had, a, serious, power, outage, (despite, backup, power, generators, and, redundant, power, sources...),, and, was, offline, for, about, half, a, day, (if, you're, technically-inclined,, the, gory, details, are, here)., Everything, is, back, up, now, and, running, normally., To, put, a, more, positive, spin, on, it, -, since, we, started, monitoring, in, 2008,, we'd, had, less, than, 5, hours, of, downtime, total,, before, this, outage., |, 24, July,, 2010, |, Expanding, drill, options:, *, added, "open, strings", shortcut, for, selecting, notes, to, test, on, violin/viola/cello/bass, drills, *, key, signatures,, chord, functions:, full, control, over, key, signatures, tested, *, chords, and, intervals:, full, control, over, possible, root, notes/, starting, notes, *, guitar, frets,, piano, keys,, paced, note, names:, full, control, over, notes, tested, All, existing, assignments, are, automatically, updated, to, ask, the, same, questions., |, 30, June,, 2010, |, A, few, bug, fixes:, *, For, intervals/chords/scales,, allow, repeat, questions, if, there, are, fewer, than, three, possible, questions, configured., *, For, some, Java, versions, on, Apple, OS, X,, interval/chord/scale, recognition, wouldn't, show, you, the, dropdown, options, properly., Also:, ongoing, tweaks, to, the, look, of, the, drills,, and, support, added, for, displaying, time, signatures, (for, in-progress, changes, to, the, rhythm, drills)., |, 1, June,, 2010, |, Enabled, MIDI, support, for, the, online, drills, for, students, of, subscribing, teachers., It's, available, for, any, of, practice, drills,, and, for, assignments, if, the, teacher, selects, it., Also:, changes, to, the, look, of, the, drills, are, underway., |, 7, May,, 2010, |, Some, updates, just, for, teacher, accounts:, *, Teacher, admins:, delete, sub-teachers, *, Export/import, assignment, definitions, (share, with, other, teachers,, backup, assignment, sets, that, you've, designed,, or, use, to, copy, assignment, sets), *, Much, faster, loading, of, custom, assignment/student, links, page,, even, with, tens, of, thousands, of, links., |, 4, April,, 2010, |, Recently,, the, drills, were, also, all, upgraded, to, match, the, new, look,, and, completely, migrated, from, an, older, Java, display, technology, to, a, newer, one., For, you,, this, just, means, the, minimum, version, of, Java, is, now, 1.4, instead, of, 1.1., For, me,, this, means, development, is, a, lot, easier!, Here's, one, thing, the, drill, upgrade, made, possible:, MIDI, support, in, the, online, drills., This, won't, be, part, of, the, free, drills,, but, subscribing, teachers, will, be, able, to, enable, MIDI, input, for, their, students, —, both, in, assignments, and, practicing, in, any, of, the, drills., This, is, just, about, ready, to, go,, and, you, can, help, testing, with, your, MIDI, setup, (and, let, me, know, if, you, see, any, problems,, of, course)., There, are, also, a, bunch, of, little, changes, to, the, drills, that, I, made, along, the, way., A, few, examples:, *, you, can, now, request, a, hint, in, the, note, naming, drills, *, the, space, to, show, problems, in, the, counterpoint, drill, is, larger, *, the, scales, drill, now, gives, you, better, control, of, what, key, signatures, to, allow,, and, avoids, "theoretical", key, signatures, automatically, *, clicking, "Stop, Drill", disables, the, button, for, a, few, seconds,, so, you, won't, accidentally, click, it, again, and, lose, your, score, One, other, change, to, mention:, At, the, end, of, this, school, semester,, I'm, planning, to, disable, printing, the, free, drill, pages., This, won't, affect, most, people, at, all, —, but, some, teachers, assign, the, free, drills, to, their, students, and, ask, for, printouts, to, track, scores,, and, I'd, like, to, encourage, them, to, use, the, inexpensive, subscription, service, for, tracking, scores., Tons, of, useful, features, come, included, with, your, subscription,, you, can, avoid, wasting, all, that, paper, ...and, eMusicTheory, relies, on, subscriptions, to, survive., (Will, this, cause, you, a, problem?, Write, me, about, it, --, I, can, probably, help.), |, 13, February,, 2010, |, eMusicTheory, has, a, new, look!, Don't, worry,, everything, is, still, here,, just, nicer-looking, and, hopefully, easier, to, use., If, you, have, any, trouble, finding, things,, scroll, to, the, bottom, of, any, page, to, see, a, site, map., The, overhaul, (including, some, technology, upgrades), was, a, lot, of, work,, but, it, will, make, adding, new, features, to, the, site, quicker, and, easier., Speak, up, if, you, run, into, problems,, of, course., This, is, the, big, first, step, in, rolling, out, a, lot, of, changes, that, you'll, see, appearing, over, the, next, couple, of, months., A, drill, upgrade, is, close, to, ready, as, well., (previous, updates), eMusicTheory, on, Facebook, An, announcement:, introducing, TheLessonRoom.com, D'Addario, &, Co., have, created, a, new, site, designed, to, be, a, hub, for, music, education:, TheLessonRoom.com., At, its, core, is, a, large, (and, growing), resource, library, for, students, and, teachers, —, videos,, articles,, sheet, music,, and, plenty, of, interactive, content., D'Addario, is, partnering, with, eMusicTheory.com, to, help, populate, this, diverse, library, of, resources,, so, you'll, recognize, some, of, the, interactivity, there!, We're, thrilled,, of, course;, it, gives, us, a, chance, to, join, in, building, a, larger, single, resource, than, any, one, site, can, create, on, their, own,, plus, teachers, using, TheLessonRoom, who, aren't, already, familiar, with, eMusicTheory, can, come, try, us, out., Their, other, killer, feature, is, a, world-wide, teacher, search:, private, teachers, can, register, for, free, to, be, included, in, the, teacher, directory,, where, students, can, find, you, by, location,, instruments, taught,, musical, style,, or, a, score, of, other, parameters., Many, people, have, asked, us, for, this, kind, of, directory, before, —, now, through, this, partnership, we, can, finally, provide, it!, D'Addario, has, populated, the, directory, with, thousands, of, teachers, who, already, work, with, them, through, other, programs,, so, searches, come, back, with, plenty, of, local, teachers, even, though, the, site, is, still, new.,  , for, teachers, Sign,
