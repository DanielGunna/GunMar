decided, that, he, will, also, offer, ONE-ON-ONE, workshops, in, addition, to, his, group, Feature, Workshops,, which, means, that, he, will, accept, only, participants, who, want, to, co-produce, (co-direct/co-write/co-shoot), a, feature-length, DV, movie, in, a, two-person, moviemaking, collaboration., Rick's, Feature, Workshops, are, limited, to, 10, persons,, who, collaborate, on, a, full-length, DV, production., All, DV, production, costs, are, included, (participants, cover, their, own, airfare/travel, expenses,, plus, food, and, lodging)., All, Feature, Workshop, shoots, are, limited, to, ten, collaborators, at, a, cost, of, $3500, per, person,, unless, otherwise, indicated., See, What, You'll, Do, At, Your, Feature, Workshop, for, more, information., Rick's, ONE-ON-ONE, workshops, ($15,000), will, demand, a, more, intensive, approach, to, the, shooting, process,, but,, at, the, same, time,, offer, a, more, relaxed, post-production, editing, timetable., Rick, and, the, participant, will, be, responsible, for, forming, a, story, concept,, scouting, locations,, selecting, actors,, shooting, the, DV, camera,, creating, shots/scenes,, maintaining, top-quality, sound,, and, ultimately, editing, the, movies, to, completion, over, the, months, that, follow., With, the, advent, of, professional, yet, low-cost, editing, software, (Final, Cut, Pro/Avid, DV), coupled, with, powerful, home, computers,, the, movies, can, be, edited, over, a, longer, period, than, just, the, 10-day, format, of, past, feature, workshops., Rick, has, recently, spent, periods, of, time, during, the, last, 9, months, editing, last, summer's, workshop, feature,, RELEASE, THE, HEAD,, to, completion, (produced, with, participant, John, Barnum, of, Arkansas, and, actor, Stephen, W., Gillard, of, Port, Townsend)., Depending, on, the, circumstances,, a, participant, may, become, the, central, editor, of, the, footage,, sending, occasional, mini-DV, tapes, to, Rick, for, preview, and, experimentation., or, vise, versa., In, any, event,, movies, will, be, edited, and, finalized, by, Rick, and, participant, after, the, shoot, is, over., Feature, Workshops, is, offering, only, a, maximum, of, six, one-on-one, shoots, offered, in, 2004,, the, dates, of, production, determined, by, the, convenience, of, the, participants, and, Rick's, schedule., The, year's, schedule, will, consist, of, just, one, shoot, every, two, months, or, so., This, means, a, first-come-first-served, attitude, will, prevail., Only, after, Rick, has, received, a, participant's, application, (half-page, real-life, story", and, basic, info...SEE, BELOW), and, the, full, payment, of, $15,000, should, a, participant, consider, that, their, shoot, is, a, "GO", (watch, for, your, shoot, &, location, listed, at, this, website, page, for, final, confirmation...), Early, registration, is, encouraged, for, the, serious, moviemaker, who, wishes, to, collaborate, with, Rick, in, this, exciting, manner., This, process, of, DV, "workshop", moviemaking, will, be, a, seat-of-the-pants, operation., Either, taking, place, in, Port, Townsend,, Washington, or, the, participants, home, town,, and, using, either, Rick's, "Dogme, 95", style, lightweight, DV, gear, or, the, participants, DV, camera/sound, gear,, the, actual, moviemaking, process, will, be, something, like, this:, CUTTING-EDGE, SHOOT, Decide, story, concept, either, beforehand,, or, once, the, participant, and, Rick, Schmidt, meet, at, the, location, (RELEASE, THE, HEAD, storyline, was, determined, after, breakfast, of, the, first, day, of, production...)., Select, actors/non-actors, from, the, local, pool, of, real, people/available, talent,, grabbing, friends, "off, the, street,", enlisting, relatives,, whatever, it, takes, to, get, a, cast., Allow, a, story, emerge, from, "just, starting", (no, pre-scripting)., Let, the, material, and, skills, of, Rick, and, participant, determine, shooting, style, and, look, of, the, DV, feature,, during, the, flow, of, production., Build, scenes, through, improvisational, dialogue, (using, the, "freeze", technique, for, halting, actors, midstream, and, adding, new, dialogue/new, action/instructions,, as, described, in, Rick's, book,, "Feature, Filmmaking, at, Used-Car, prices,", Penguin, Books)., Evaluate, what, has, been, accomplished, each, day, during, the, moviemaking, flow,, to, determine, which, new, scenes, are, necessary, to, fulfill, a, story, structure, essential, for, editing, (determining, a, good, ending, scene, by, Day-10)., (This, 6-step, approach, is, the, exact, same, method, Rick, and, co-writers/co-directors, used, to, create, the, Feature, Workshops, production,, CHETZEMOKA'S, CURSE, [DOGME, #10],, and, many, other, recent, features, [see, Rick's, on-line, Filmography],, shot, in, both, DV, and, film.), Together,, Rick-and-participant, will, cover, all, the, bases, necessary, to, produce, a, DV, feature, capable, of, competing, in, the, world's, marketplace., While, the, roles, may, vary, on, different, shoots, --, sometimes, Rick, will, shoot,, other, times, the, participant, will, perform, cinematographic, duties,, direct, actors,, think, up, new, scenes, or, become, a, lead, actor,, -, the, end, result, will, be, "a, DV, by, Rick, Schmidt, and, __your, name, here___,, with, major, profit, points, (the, 85%, remaining, after, reserving, 5%, for, Feature, Workshops, and, 10%, for, an, investor's, blow, up, to, 35MM), shared, equally, between, Rick,, participant,, and, perhaps, one, all-involved, lead, actor, (as, was, the, case, for, RELEASE, THE, HEAD)., So,, if, you, are, either, a, complete, novice, (never, shot, DV), or, a, indie, veteran, filmmaker, with, professional, DV, gear, and, a, filmography,, here's, an, opportunity, to, break, the, ice, on, creating, a, new,, cutting-edge, improv, DV, feature,, working, with, an, indie, maverick, who, "wrote, the, book", and, has, 18+, low/no, budget, features, to, his, credit, (his, first, two-man, collaboration, with, director, Wayne, Wang,, A, MAN,, A, WOMAN,, AND, A, KILLER,, helped, begin, that, major, director's, career,, as, his, book, did, for, Kevin, Smith/CLERKS, some, twenty, years, later)., At, any, rate,, Rick, will, look, forward, to, shooting, in, your, town,, helping, you, make, a,

etc.), to, work, with, him, over, a, 10, day, period, to, write,, direct,, shoot,, edit,, and, co-produce, a, 75, minute, film, in, 16MM., For, 1998,, he, had, added, cutting-edge, Pro-DVCAM, shoots, to, his, list, of, collaborative, productions,, believing, that, DIGITAL, VIDEO, must, no, longer, be, ignored, as, a, viable, no-budget, method, of, producing, feature-length, works., Lead, actress,
