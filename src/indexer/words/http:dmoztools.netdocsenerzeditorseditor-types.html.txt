Editors, Category, Moderators, Category, Editalls, Category, Editors, Category, Editors, are, those, who, only, edit, a, finite, set, of, categories., This, group, of, editors, makes, up, the, majority, of, the, DMOZ, community., Category, Editors, can, only, edit, in, the, categories, which, have, been, granted, to, them., These, guidelines, cover, everything, that, a, category, editor, can, do., All, new, editors, join, DMOZ, to, edit, one, category., As, they, get, some, editing, experience,, they, may, be, granted, additional, categories, by, filling, out, the, New, Category, Request, Form., A, link, to, this, form, resides, on, the, editor, dashboard., All, category, requests, are, reviewed, by, Meta, Editors,, Category, Moderators,, and, Admins., Consult, the, Guidelines, for, New, Permissions, for, tips, and, advice, on, requesting, new, categories, to, edit., Greenbusters, This, permission, gives, category, editors, the, ability, to, edit, unreviewed, queues, in, very, broad, areas, of, the, directory., It, gives, editors, the, opportunity, to, expand, their, editing, abilities, by, taking, on, limited, permissions, in, very, large, categories, to, which, they, normally, would, not, be, granted, full, editing, privileges, due, to, lack, of, experience., The, goals, of, the, Greenbuster, permission, are, to:, Give, editors, more, opportunities, to, expand, their, editing, abilities., Enhance, the, directory's, quality, and, scope., Get, as, many, good, editors, editing, across, the, directory, as, possible., Scale, the, editorial, model, to, more, quickly, and, efficiently, handle, the, ever, growing, rate, of, new, suggestions., Reduce, the, backlogs, of, unreviewed, sites., The, greenbuster, permission, is, perfectly, suited, for, a, relatively, new, editor, who, wants, to, edit, a, wider, range, of, topics, and, subjects,, but, may, not, have, enough, edits, to, be, granted, broader, categories., Greenbusters, provides, a, way, to, quickly, demonstrate, your, abilities., Greenbuster, editors, may, be, granted, full, category, privileges, if, they, show, they, can, do, a, good, job, at, selecting, quality, sites, with, good, annotations., For, example,, if, you, edited, a, category, like, Sports:, Baseball:, Minor, League:, Leagues:, Independent,, you, might, consider, requesting, greenbusting, permissions, for, the, Minor, League, or, Baseball, parent, categories., Alternatively,, you, could, apply, to, greenbust, a, related, Baseball, category, in, another, part, of, the, directory,, such, as, Shopping:, Sports:, Baseball, or, some, other, area, of, interest., The, unusual, name, of, this, type, of, permission, comes, from, the, way, unreviewed, counts, appear, on, the, editor, dashboard., The, number, of, unreviewed, in, a, given, category, is, rendered, in, green, text., As, a, result,, editors, refer, to, unreviewed, sites, as, 'greens'., The, permission, was, introduced, as, a, way, to, purge, backlogged, unreviewed, pools, --, 'busting', them, of, 'greens'., Use, the, New, Category, Request, Form, to, request, greenbuster, permissions., For, more, information, about, the, Greenbusting, permission,, see, the, Greenbuster, Guidelines., Admins, The, administrators, oversee, project, management, of, the, directory,, including, all, aspects, of, DMOZ,, with, the, exception, of, legal, matters,, operational,, hardware,, hosting, issues, and, management, of, staff,, which, are, the, responsibility, of, AOL/Netscape, staff, members., For, more, information, on, the, Admins,, see, the, Admin, Guidelines., Meta, Editors, The, meta, permission, is, highest, level, of, permission, granted., Meta, editors, are, the, leaders, and, community, managers, for, the, entire, directory., As, a, group,, the, Metas, form, the, governing, body, of, DMOZ., They, work, with, admins, and, the, community, to, set, directory, guidelines, and, shape, its, growth., They, review, new, editor, applications, and, new, category, requests, from, existing, editors., They, can, also, reinstate, and, revoke, accounts, and, permissions., Removal, of, accounts, is, a, group, process, requiring, a, consensus, vote, following, a, careful, and, thorough, review, of, editor, activity, within, DMOZ., Metas, have, the, same, privileges, as, editall, and, catmv, editors,, and, are, able, to, perform, the, vast, majority, of, directory, maintenance, tasks., Meta, permissions, are, granted, only, to, seasoned, editors, who, have, shown, superior, editing,, leadership, and, communication, skills,, as, well, as, solid, understanding, of,, and, support, for, the, directory's, higher, purpose, and, mission., For, more, information, on, Meta, editors,, see, the, Meta, Guidelines., Editall, Editors, An, editall, can, edit, in, every, category, without, being, listed, as, an, editor,, including, the, Test, category., Editalls, cannot, edit, in, other, editors', bookmarks., They, can, also, delete, an, empty, category, even, if, there, are, editors, still, listed, in, it., When, they, create, a, new, subcategory,, editalls, can, also, specify, a, single, editor, to, be, automatically, assigned, as, the, editor, of, that, category., Editalls, play, a, vital, role, in, DMOZ, as, they, oversee, content, quality,, and, are, champions, of, editorial, integrity., Editall, privileges, are, granted, to, experienced, editors, who, have, exhibited, a, solid, grasp, of, the, DMOZ, guidelines, and, good, editing, skills, in, diverse, areas, of, the, directory., We, encourage, all, editors, to, aim, for, editall, permissions., The, more, quality, editors, we, have, with, access, to, edit, broad, areas, of, the, directory,, the, better., Editall/Catmv, Editors, Catmv, editors, are, editalls, who, can, rename, and, move, categories, all, at, once., They, can, keep, all, of, the, existing, editors,, editing, history,, newsgroups,, @links, and, related, categories, intact., Categories, moved, by, a, catmv, leave, a, redirect, behind, so, users, attempting, to, go, to, the, old, category, will, be, redirected, to, the, new, one., In, addition,, catmv, editors, have, the, same, powers, as, editalls., The, focus, of, an, Editall/Catmv, is, on, building, clean, and, intuitive, taxonomies, and, quality, content, listings, across, all, directory, categories., For, more, information, on, Editalls, and, Editall/Catmv,, see, the, Editall, Guidelines., Category, Moderators, Category, Moderators, have, a, unique, set, of, privileges, which, combine, the, aspects, of, the, editall, and, meta, editor, permissions,, but, their, scope, is, limited, to, one, top, level, category, node, (e.g., Arts,, Computers,, etc.)., Category, Moderators, can, do, all, the, functions, of, an, editall/catmv, within, their, node,, as, well, as, limited, meta, functions,, which, include, the, ability, to, review, new, applications, and, category, permission, requests., Category, Moderators, lead, forum, discussions, in, their, subjects,, mentor, new, editors,, keep, editors, on, track, with, reorganizations, and, current, events,, and, essentially, act, as, experts, for, their, given, category., For, more, information, on, Category, Moderators,, see, the, Category, Moderator, Guidelines., Category, Editalls, The, category, editall, permission, has, features, of, category, moderator, and, editall., In, addition, to, standard, category, editor, functionality,, Category, Editalls, can, move, categories, and, @links,, power, review, edit,, change, search, strings,, and, edit, all, categories, in, the, given, node., Category, Editall, is, granted, for, top-level, categories, (e.g., Sports),, World/<language>, categories, (e.g., World/Svenska),, and, World/<language>/<topic>, categories, (e.g., World/Nederlands/Spellen)., Where, the, main, emphasis, of, a, Category, Moderator, is, on, the, community, and, peer, review, activities, within, a, specific, node,, the, focus, of, a, Category, Editall, is, on, building, clean, and, intuitive, taxonomies, and, quality, content, listings, within, the, node., Last, update:, Sat, Jun, 27, 07:17, EDT, 2015, Copyright, ©, 2016, AOL, Inc., (Terms, of, Use, -, License)]
