goes, back, to, the, legendary, Teddy, Weahkee, (d.),, one, of, the, first, Zuni, artists, to, carve, fetish, creatures,, arguably, the, very, first, carve, them, as, an, art, form., Born, in, 1946,, Lena, has, worked, enough, years, to, decide, to, stop, carving., This, is, a, considerable, loss, to, collectors, of, Zuni, fetish, carvings., Lena, and, her, sister,, Dinah, (Gasper),, were, daughters, of, the, Teddy's, daughter,, Edna, Leki, (d.),, who, was, also, a, highly, collected, carver., Dinah, was, married, to, Peter, Gasper, Sr., (d.)., There, offspring, included, carvers,, Debra, Gasper, (Tsethlikai), and, Peter, Gasper,, Jr., All, of, who, carried, on, the, carving, tradition., Lena,, who, was, married, to, Rignie, Boone, (d.),, has, two, children,, Evalena, Boone, and, Leland, Boone., Both, continue, to, carve., While, Lena, is, retiring,, her, influence, continues, in, her, nephew,, Robert, Michael, Weahkee., Lena, has, been, a, major, mentor, and, inspiration, for, Robert, Michael, Weahkee., In, fact,, it, was, Lena, who, first, introduced, ZuniLink.com, to, Robert, Micheal, Weahkee's, work., It, was, in, Santa, Fe,, NM,, where, we, had, agreed, to, meet, Lena, so, she, could, deliver, new, carvings, we, were, purchasing, from, her., At, the, conclusion, of, that, transaction,, she, excitedly, asked, us, to, join, her, at, her, car., She, opened, the, trunk, and, eagerly, presented, new, antler, altar, carvings,  by, Robert, Michael., This, was, our, first, encounter, with, his, carvings, and, the, first, time, we, had, even, learned, about, him., We, were, impressed, by, their, artistry, and, immediately, acquired, them,, It, was, the, continuation, of, a, beautiful, friendship, with, the, Weahkee, family., We, continue, to, visit, with, Lena,, Evalena,, Leland, and, Robert, Michael, at, her, Zuni, home, each, year., What, customarily, happens, when, an, artist, stops, creating, is, a, rush, to, acquire, his, or, her, work, that, is, still, on, the, market., This, is, often, followed, by, a, price, increase, inspired, by, decreasing, supply, of, new, carvings., As, a, matter, of, principle,, we, refuse, to, engage, in, this, behavior., We, will, continue, offer, all, of, the, work, we, have, by, Lena,for, as, long, as, we, have, items, to, sell,, at, the, original, prices,, ZuniLink.com, encourages, you, to,

smaller, creatures, secured, to, the, larger, carving, with, sinew, or, wax, string., A, third, approach, is, to, carve, each, protective, animal, as, a, single, creature, and, gather, the, six, as, a, set., Each, carver, has, a, different, artistic, vision, reflected, in, a, different, stylistic, approach., Perhaps, it, is, the, seriousness, of, the, subject, matter, but, a, six, direction, set, seems, never, to, be, taken, on, as, anything, but, the, highest, calling, of, the, carver., Collectors, of, Six, Direction, sets, like, to, build, menageries, that, show, a, breadth, of,

carvings, increasing, in, cost., According, to, the, esteemed, Smithsonian, Magazine,, it, could, be, because, turquoise, is, getting, rarer, to, find, and, more, expensive, to, buy., An, article, in, the, Smithsonian, by Saba, Naseem (smithsonian.com), reports, that, high, quality, turquoise,, the, opaque, mineral, combining, hydrous, phosphate, of, copper, and, aluminum,, is, being, mined, out, in, America, and, otherwise, becoming, more, difficult, to, find,  on, the, raw, materials, market., The, significance, of, turquoise, extends, back, to, ancient, Egypt,, where, it, was, used, in, the, funerary, regalia, of, such, commanding, figures, as, King, Tut.,   , The, article's, author, highlights, a, new, show,“Glittering, World:, Navajo, Jewelry, of, the, Yazzie, Family,”, open, in, New, York, City's, National, Museum, of, the, American, Indian., The, show's, curator,, Lois, Sherr, Dubin,, believes,, “There, is, no, more, important, defining, gem, stone, in, Southwest, jewelry.", We, at, Aboriginals', Native-American-Jewelry.org, agree, that, turquoise, has, a, sovereign, position, in, the, world, of, Indian, jewelry, of, the, American, Southwest., Many, Navajos, believe, throwing, bits, of, turquoise, into, a, stream, will, bring, rain,, the, life-giving, event, for, the, aridity, of, the, Southwest. , turquoise's, variety, of, blue, and, green, shades,, with, matrix, of, black,, brown, and, white,, are, said, to, give, special, moment, when, given, as, a, gift, to, someone., That's, fortuitous, for, those, born, in, December,, the, month, that, claims, turquoise, as, its, birth, stone., Many, mines, across, the, Southwestern, United, States, contain, gem-quality, turquoise., But, this, high, grade, turquoise, is, becoming, more, difficult, to, come, by, than, diamonds,, a, conclusion, the, author, appears, to, support., It, may, be, true, for, turquoise, from, American, mines,, which, have, seen, production, decline, for, a, number, of, reasons,, including, government, regulation, on, high, mining, costs., On, the, other, hand,, turquoise, from, China, is, plentiful, on, the, market., Much, of, this, Asian, turquoise,, however,, has, been, adulterated, with, stabilizers, and, color, enhancers, by, the, time, it, reaches, the, talented, hands, of, Navajo, and, Zuni, jewelry, makers, and, fetish, carvers., The, sacred, nature, of, turquoise, is, underscored, for, Native, people, and, those, who, connect, with, spiritual, influences., When, combined, with, the, deep, cultural, traditions, of, Native, American, jewelry, makers, and, the, inherent, "healing", properties, of, Zuni, fetish, carvings,, turquoise, takes, on, values, that, transcend, the, cost, of, its, acquisition., These, objects,, if, you, are, fortunate,
