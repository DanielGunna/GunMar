the, meantime,, here, is, a, question, I, meant, to, answer, some, weeks, ago.], This, question, from, Hong, Kong:, Could, you, point, me, to, a, good, online, screenwriters, course, for, absolute, beginners., I, appreciate, your, help., kind, regards, Maria, AFI, has, a, free, introduction, for, beginners, seminar, online, here., Other, resources, you, will, want, to, consult, include, the, following:, First, are, the, many, sites, that, have, downloadable, screenplays,, including, the, script, gallery, at, screentalk.biz., I, like, this, one, because, all, the, scripts, are, PDF, files, and,, therefore,, in, there, original, format., You, should, read, scripts, voraciously., Second,, there, are, the, wonderful, columns, at, Wordplayer,, the, website, run, by, A-list, writers, Ted, Elliott, and, Terry, Rossio., You, should, read, all, of, them., In, fact,, the, entire, site, is, terrific., Third,, the, WGA, west, website, has, a, number, of, great, resources, for, writers,, including, columns, on, craft., Fourth,, there, are, a, number, of, websites, that, explain, traditional, three-act, screenplay, structure., The, substantial, caveat, on, these, is, that, every, writer, develops, his, or, her, own, ideas, about, structure, –, so, do, not, take, any, one, set, of, ideas, as, gospel., In, fact,, some, of, them, will, just, send, you, in, the, wrong, direction., One, example, of, a, site, that, explains, structure, is, Screenplay, Mastery., I, am, not, endorsing, this, site, in, particular;, you, should, look, at, a, number, of, sites, to, see, different,

February, 26, SCREENWRITING, 2.O, (Classic, Post), Web, 2.0, is, a, phrase, that, refers, to, the, new, direction, of, the, Internet:, web, applications, that, function, through, your, browser,, also, known, as, “web, apps”., For, example,, word, processing, is, now, available, for, free, straight, from, your, Internet, browser, from, a, dozen, different, sources,, including, the, very, slick, Buzzword,, Google, Docs,, Zoho, Writer,, and, others., That, means, you, don’t, need, to, buy, MS, Word, or, any, other, word, processor,, as, long, as, you, have, an, Internet, connection., And, your, documents, are, available, from, anywhere, in, the, world,, as, long, as, you, have, an, Internet, connection., Similarly,, spreadsheets, that, compete, with, Excel, and, Lotus, are, also, beginning, to, be, available, through, web, apps., So,, how, does, this, relate, to, screenwriting?, The, folks, at, Zhura, were, kind, enough, to, invite, me, to, test, drive, their, new, screeenwriting, web, app, at,, where, else,, zhura.com., The, idea, is, that, you, no, longer, need, to, buy, any, screenwriting, software;, you, can, just, write, your, script, online, and,, when, you’re, done,, download, it, in, pdf, format, for, submission, to, your, favorite, Hollywood, mogul., Before, writing, this, post,, I, took, some, time, to, play, with, this, new, toy, and, even, asked, Zhura, some, questions,, which, they, quickly, answered., At, first,, I, was, put, off, by, all, of, the, “corroberation”, features., When, you, arrive, at, the, front, page,, you, see, a, world, that, looks, different, than, that, of, any, serious, screenwriter, –, namely,, open, access, to, everyone’s, drafts, and, ideas,, free, collaboration,, and, no, way, to, ever, protect, your, intellectual, property., That, is, the, “Public”, side., It, is, the, opposite, of, what, working, writers, need., However,, I, quickly, discovered, the, “Personal”, side,, where, everything, is, private,, your, files, are, not, accessible, to, anyone,, and, you, use, the, web, app, pretty, much, like, you, would, use, any, screenwriting, software., You, can, even, give, access, to, anyone, you, want,, such, as, your, writing, partner,, so, he, or, she, can, access, the, work, from, any, Internet, connection., It, automatically, saves,, keeps, revisions,, and, allows, you, to, revert, to, a, previous, draft., The, fun, of, this, program, is, that, (i), it’s, free;, (ii), it, works, pretty, well;, and, (iii), it, exports, to, Final, Draft, (in, txt, format), and, likely, most, other, screenwriting, programs, (I, don’t, use, others,, so, I, couldn’t, test, it, on, them)., However,, it, is, a, beta, program, and, still, has, a, some, drawbacks,, which, the, folks, at, Zhura, tell, me, they, are, working, slavishly, to, address, even, as, you, read, this., First,, for, a, full, length, screenplay,, I, found, the, web, app, sluggish,, which, took, me, right, out, of, my, work., The, last, thing, I, want, to, think, about, while, writing, is, the, software., However,, for, shorter, pieces,, and, even, for, longer, pieces, if, you, break, them, up, into, separate, files,, it, worked, fine., Second,, it, does, not, show, traditional, page, breaks, until, you, save, as, a, pdf, or, export, as, a, txt., That, means,, while, you, are, writing,, you, have, to, guess, where, you, are, in, the, script., That, is, a, problem, I, have, seen, in, other, recent, programs, as, well., Zhura, says, they, are, also, working, on, that, issue., Finally,, it, does, not, have, some, of, the, bells, and, whistles, common, to, the, most, popular, screenwriting, software,, including,, for, example,, the, ability, to, change, page, length, by, imperceptibly, changing, line, spacing., I, would, not, be, surprised, to, see, all, of, these, issues, addressed, in, the, future., In, summary,, I, can’t, say, Zhura, is, quite, there, yet,, at, least, not, for, the, working, writer, or, the, aspiring, to, be, working, writer., It, needs, to, have, all, of, the, features, of, the, major, screenwriting, software, to, do, that., However,, it, is, a, huge, step, in, the, right, direction,, a, lot, of, fun, to, play, with,, and, (with, luck), will, add, the, features, needed, to, be, really, competitive., It, is, definitely, worth, signing, up, and, checking, out., Let, me, know, what, you, think., Enough., Now, go, write., Category:, Resources, |, 11, Comments, on, SCREENWRITING, 2.O, (Classic, Post), February, 8, ARTFUL, DEBATE, (Classic, Post), I’ve,
