[DMOZ, Open, Directory, Project, Directory, About, DMOZ, Editing, Guidelines, Editor, Resources, Applying, for, Categories, Category, Checking, Preferred, Terms, Regional, Template, Robozilla, Reds, URL, Notes, Glossary, In, Other, Languages, Français, -, French, Moving, listings, and, submissions, Listings, and, submissions, (we'll, refer, to, both, as, "sites", in, this, document), need, to, be, moved, between, categories, for, all, kinds, of, reasons., Many, public, suggestions, arrive, at, a, category, that, isn't, quite, right, (wrong, topic,, wrong, language,, regional, vs., topical,, etc.)., Listed, sites, may, need, to, be, moved, when, the, topic, of, the, site, changes,, or, when, a, category, is, being, reorganized, or, subcategorized., This, document, provides, some, tips, on, how, to, move, sites, around,, as, well, as, some, guidance, about, when, to, conduct, moves, yourself,, and, when, (and, how), to, ask, for, help., How, to, move, Both, the, URL, editing, form, and, the, unreviewed, editing, form, contain, two, fields, that, allow, sites, to, be, moved, to, a, different, category., The, first, field, is, a, drop-down, selection, populated, with, all, the, categories, that, are, related, to, the, current, category:, each, of, the, ancestor, categories,, each, of, the, child, categories,, any, categories, referred, to, in, @links, or, related, category, links, defined, in, the, category,, and, the, closest, matches, to, the, current, category, in, all, other, languages, defined, in, DMOZ., The, second, field, is, a, text, input,, allowing, you, to, enter, an, entirely, different, category., We'll, talk, about, both, fields, in, more, detail, below., But, first, let's, understand, what, happens, when, you, use, these, fields:, When, you, make, a, selection, or, type, text, into, either, of, the, move-to, fields,, the, site, will, be, moved, to, the, new, category, as, part, of, the, editing, operation., All, the, other, editing, operations,, such, as, changes, to, URL,, title,, or, description,, are, completed, at, the, same, time, as, the, move., The, action, specified, by, the, radio-button, selection, at, the, bottom, of, the, editing, form, ("update",, "delete",, "move, to, unreviewed"), is, also, carried, out,, so, you, can, simultaneously, move, and, publish, a, suggested, URL,, or, move, and, unreview, a, listed, site, that, needs, editor, attention, in, the, new, category., But, there, is, one, important, exception., If, you, move, a, site, into, a, category, where, you, do, not, have, editing, privileges,, the, site, will, arrive, in, unreviewed,, even, if, it, was, previously, listed., Something, else, to, be, aware, of, is, that, a, new, listing, will, overwrite, any, previous, listings, of, the, same, URL, in, the, same, category,, so, it, is, a, good, idea, to, make, sure, the, URL, isn't, already, listed, there, before, making, the, move., This, is, easy, to, do, when, the, URL, is, not, changed, as, part, of, the, editing, operation., The, categories, in, which, the, site, is, listed, appear, at, the, top, of, the, editing, page., If, you, change, the, URL,, make, sure, to, click, the, "find, listings", link, to, see, if, the, new, URL, is, already, listed, somewhere., The, selection, drop-down, field, contains, all, the, related, categories,, as, described, above., The, equivalent, category, in, other, languages, is, determined, according, to, the, language, groups, that, have, been, defined, for, the, current, category, and, its, parent, categories, up, the, tree., For, some, languages,, there, may, be, an, exact, fit., For, example,, Home:, Gardening:, Plants, has, an, exact, match, in, German, (World:, Deutsch:, Zuhause:, Garten:, Pflanze)., For, other, languages,, especially, those, with, a, less, developed, category, structure,, only, an, approximate, match, is, available., For, example,, the, closest, Portuguese, category, is, World:, Português:, Lar:, Jardinagem., Approximate, matches, are, marked, with, an, asterisk., If, you, do, not, have, the, language, skills, to, compose, a, title, and, description, in, the, different, language,, it, is, fine, to, send, the, site, to, the, approximately, matching, category, in, the, other, language, branch, where, local, editors, can, edit, and, publish, it., The, selection, field, only, lists, the, direct, child, categories., If, you, need, to, move, the, site, to, a, deeper, category, (e.g.,, from, Home:, Gardening:, Plants, to, Home:, Gardening:, Plants:, P:, Primula),, you, will, need, to, use, the, text, input, box, to, specify, the, move-to, category., You, can, type, a, category, or, paste, the, category, URL, in, this, field., Alternatively,, you, can, use, the, navigation, controls, to, select, the, category., The, input, field, will, always, start, with, the, current, category., From, there,, you, can, move, up, the, tree, using, the, green, left, arrow, icon,, and, down, the, tree, using, the, drop-down, selection, to, its, right., This, is, convenient, when, sorting, down, sites, to, lower, levels, as, in, the, Primula, example, above., When, to, move, It, is, our, goal, to, keep, DMOZ, comprehensive, and, to, keep, valid, sites, listed, rather, than, delete, them, or, move, them, to, unreviewed., If, the, site, is, listed,, but, would, be, better, in, another, category, that, you, can, edit,, simply, move, it, (select, or, type, the, destination, category, and, use, the, update, option)., If, the, site, is, listed,, but, should, be, moved, to, be, a, category, outside, your, area, of, permissions,, you, need, to, use, the, forum, threads, dedicated, to, this, purpose, so, that, an, editor, with, permissions, can, make, the, move, for, you., There, are, suitable, editor, forum, threads, with, titles, such, as, "Rename-Delete-Move-Sort-Altlang-Relcat-@Link, Requests",, usually, near, the, top, of, each, forum, topic., If, the, site, is, unreviewed,, there, is, no, need, to, request, someone's, help., Simply, use, the, pull-down, list, or, the, category, selector, to, put, the, destination, category, into, the, form, and, use, the, "Keep, in, Unreviewed", option., If, the, site, is, fine, where, it, is, listed,, but, it, could, be, listed, in, an, additional, category,, you, can, use, the, forward, a, copy, link, for, the, listing, on, the, category, edit, page, to, send, an, additional, copy, to, the, second, category, –, either, to, unreviewed, or, as, a, published, listing, (if, you, have, the, necessary, editing, privileges)., Tips, When, working, with, misplaced, unreviewed, sites,, selecting, the, exact, destination, category, can, be, difficult., Getting, the, suggestion, to, the, right, area, of, the, directory, is, already, a, good, start,, for, which, the, pull-down, list, is, usually, best., When, the, destination, category, is, nearby,, the, category, selection, box, enables, switching, the, category, easily., In, other, cases,, you, can, search, for, and, copy/paste, a, category, directly, into, this, box., Correcting, the, suggested, titles, and/or, descriptions, of, the, unreviewed, sites, you, move, is, helpful, and, appreciated, by, other, editors,, as, is, leaving, an, editor, note, to, explain, the, move,, particularly, when, the, reason, may, not, be, obvious, to, all, editors., Listings, and, unreviewed, sites, should, never, be, moved, from, the, live, directory, into, either, Bookmarks, or, Test, categories, as, they, are, then, not, reachable, by, most, editors., Copy, the, sites, instead., Changing, the, destination, category, in, both, the, pull-down, list, and, the, category, selector, will, cause, an, error., Use, one, or, the, other,, not, both., To, identify, the, language, of, a, site,, there, is, a, collection, of, resources, in, Test:, Tools, for, Editors:, Translation, Tools:, Language, Guessing, If, the, site, is, not, listable, anywhere, in, the, directory,, simply, delete, it, with, a, brief, editor, note, explaining, why., Last, update:, Wed, Dec, 28, 18:31, EST, 2016, Copyright, ©, 2016, AOL, Inc., (Terms, of, Use, -,
