[ ,  ,  ,  ,  , A, Treatise, on, the, Aesthetics, of, Symmetry, Preface,  , Home, Review, Boring, Grading, Motif, Ratings, Examples, Angles, Creative, Links,  , I, was, walking, along, Commonwealth, Drive, one, day, in, Boston, admiring, a, wrought, iron, fence, when, I, became, introspective,, curious, as, to, why, I, appraised, the, fence, as, attractive., It, had, something, to, do, with, the, inherent, symmetrical, design., With, this, in, mind,, I, scrutinized, other, items, that, I, traveled, past, exhibiting, symmetry., Some, were, quite, provocative,, others, were, nominally, patterned,, and, still, others, were, rather, tedious, and, boring., The, conclusions, I, depict, in, this, essay, are, anything, but, scientific., Even, if, you, concur, one, hundred, percent, with, everything, I, describe,, be, careful, when, applying, this, to, your, own, designs., At, times, the, theories, that, we, use, to, constrain, ourselves, during, design, come, back, to, bite, us, in, our, rear, ends., These, ideas, have, the, potential, to, capture, your, visual, design, processes, and, hold, it, hostage,, incarcerating, all, of, your, designs, to, a, central, structural, consistency., Bad, plan., Please, apply, what, you, learn, from, this, treatise, where, its, application, fits,, but, don't, force, all, of, your, work, toward, satisfying, these, observations., Finally,, aesthetics, also, transpire, below,, on, top, of,, and, beyond, symmetry., Some, of, the, most, exquisite, art, and, craft, that, I've, seen, had, nothing, to, with, symmetry, at, all.,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , Geometric, Symmetry:, Quick, Review,  ,  ,  , Symmetry, has, several, variants,, but, the, basic, symmetrical, operations, are, Translation,, Rotation,, and, Reflection., Translation, is, simply, the, movement, in, a, linear, direction, of, a, design;, here, is, an, example, of, a, translation:, The, design, above, has, been, translated, four, times., A, rotation, is, the, movement, in, a, circular, direction, of, a, design;, here, is, an, example, of, a, rotation:, The, design, above, has, been, rotated, six, times., Finally, a, reflection, is, the, inversion, of, a, design, across, a, line;, here, is, an, example, of, a, reflection:, The, design, above, has, been, reflected, across, both, horizontal, and, vertical, lines., Symmetrical, operations, can, be, combined;, here, is, an, example, of, a, translation, combined, with, a, reflection, (this, is, called, a, Glide, Reflection):, Here, is, an, example, of, a, translation, combined, with, a, rotation, (a, Glide, Rotation):,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , What, is, Boring,  ,  ,  , Symmetrical, operations, certainly, add, some, elegance, to, an, otherwise, drab, design., You, can, quite, easily,, however,, have, too, much, of, a, good, thing., The, following, design,, for, example,, is, something, that, I, would, consider, boring:, Too, many, repeats, of, the, primary, simple, design, bores, us., What, constitutes, "too, many", or, "too, few", repeats, is, a, matter, of, taste, and, personal, opinion., It, also, has, to, do, with, the, complexity, of, the, simple, design,, or, motif., Furthermore,, it, might, be, affected, by, the, symmetry, operation:, The, above, example, is, similar, to, the, boring, example, with, too, many, repeats,, however, since, the, symmetrical, operation, is, a, Glide, Rotation, instead, of, a, Translation,, it, is, considerably, more, interesting.,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , Grading, Operations,  ,  ,  , Can, we, find, some, arithmetic, rules, to, show, whether, a, symmetrical, design, will, be, visually, appealing?, Let's, put, together, an, equation, where, a, higher, rating, indicates, complete, randomness, (or, a, symmetry, that, is, too, challenging, to, discern),, and, a, lower, rating, shows, boredom., We'll, call, this, rating, the, Interest, level., Clearly,, the, more, complicated, the, motif,, the, higher, the, rating, should, be., So, we, will, want, higher, motif, complexity, to, increase, the, number., More, repeats, makes, for, a, less, interesting, pattern,, so, we, will, want, higher, repeats, to, decrease, the, number., I, therefore, propose, an, equation, for, determining, the, Interest, level, of, a, particular, symmetrical, design:, I, =, M/sn,, where, "I", is, the, Interest, level,, "s", is, a, number, for, the, symmetry, operation,, "M", is, a, number, for, the, complexity, of, the, underlying, motif,, and, "n", is, the, number, of, times, that, the, motif, is, repeated., After, considerable, trial, and, error, I, have, arrived, at, some, appropriate, values, for, s,, the, factor, for, the, type, of, symmetry, operation:,  ,  ,  ,  , Translation, ., ., ., ., ., 5, Reflection, ., ., ., ., ., 2.5, Rotation, ., .,

Interest, level,, allow, me, to, digress, to, discuss, the, M, value, for, the, complexity, of, the, motif., I, propose, a, simple, measure, of, complexity, for, the, motif:, count, the, number, of, distinct, elements., Here, are, some, sample, motifs,, with, the, corresponding, count, of, their, "M":, Note, that, the, concept, of, a, "distinct, element", is, a, bit, subjective:, it, depends, on, what, you, perceive, as, an, element., In, some, designs, this, is, not, readily, apparent..., does, an, arc, count, as, it's, own, element,, or, is, it, part, of, some, larger, visual, portion?, Here, you, will, need, to, use, your, visual, design, skills, as, a, license, to, interpretation., A, motif, can, have, its, own, symmetry, beyond, that, of, the, overall, design., In, the, example, below,, although, the, overall, pattern, exhibits, Rotation, symmetry,, the, motif, itself, has, a, design, with, Reflection, symmetry:, In, the, case, such, as, above, where, the, Motif, show, signs, of, symmetry,, the, Interest, level, equation, should, properly, be, I, =, M/ysn,, where, "y",, the, additional, divisor,, represents, the, factor, for, the, type, of, symmetry, operation, within, the, motif, itself.,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , Ratings, Guide,  ,  ,  , Having, explained, everything, that, goes, into, the, calculation,, here, is, how, I, interpret, the, computed, Interest, level,, I:,  ,

., ., ., ., ., ., Random,  ,  ,  , These, are, not, hard, and, fast, rankings, and, are, intended, only, as, a, general, guideline., When, you, review, the, examples, below,, see, if, you, agree, in, your, artist's, heart, and, your, subjective, imagination, with, the, calculated, ratings, and, interpretations.,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , Examples,  ,  ,  , The, page, that, is, linked, below, has, examples, of, various, symmetrical, designs,, along, with, the, computed, Interest, level, and, the, factors, that, contributed, to, that, rating:, Symmetry, Interest, Level, Examples,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , Visual, Angle, Constraints,  ,  ,  , Although, the, above, examples, are, appropriate, for, computer-based, displays,, design, in, real-life, usually, extends, well, beyond, 600, by, 800, pixel, resolution., Because, the, human, eye, has, both, limited, angles, of, visual, perception, and, visual, acuity,, you, need, to, consider, the, observant, range, when, designing, for, larger, areas., For, example,, a, long-running, fence, may, have, several, hundred, repeats, of, a, motif,, even, though, the, eyes, of, any, given, observer, may, only, be, seeing, twenty, of, the, repeats, in, a, single, glance., A, more, subtle, relevance, is, whether, a, design, element, should, be, considered, as, a, motif, within, a, larger, symmetrical, design,, or, as, an, individual, item, within, a, motif., This, confusion, can, arise, because, the, central, eight, degrees, of, the, visual, field, are, scrutinized, at, a, higher, level, of, detail, than, the, surrounding, background., When, standing, next, to, a, large, wall, painting, of, the, following, design,, each, element, is, likely, to, be, viewed, as, a, motif, in, the, overall, design:, In, other, words,, on, a, computer, monitor, this, has, an, Interest, level, of, 8/(2.5)(1)(1), =, 3.2,, but, the, Interest, level, standing, next, to, a, large, wall, painting, of, the, same, design, would, be, 14/(2.5)(8)(1), =, 0.7., Hence,, be, aware, of, how, your, designs, are, viewed, in, the, context, of, the, visual, angles, distinguished, by, the, observer.,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , Creative, Ideas,  ,  ,  , This, treatise, has, discussed, the, evaluation, of, an, existing, design;, if, you, are, creative, then, you, can, use, your, imagination, and, talents, to, build, interesting, motifs, from, scratch., The, page, below, flips, the, Interest, Level, formula, around, and, demonstrates, how, to, develop, effective, motifs, with, interesting, symmetry, in, mind, as, the, target., Developing, Effective, Motifs,  ,  ,  ,
