[Users, of, Lynx, and, disabled, readers, can, jump, directly, to, page, content, with, this, link., Corky, and, the, Juice, Pigs, Corky, and, the, Juice, Pigs, was, a, CANADIAN, muscial, comedy, trio, made, up, of:, [d], Phil, Nichol....., d, Greg, Neale....., d, and, Sean, Cullen, It, seems, official, that, the, group, has, broken, up,, and, each, member, is, pursuing, solo, efforts., You, may, never, see, Corky, and, the, Juice, Pigs, perform, again, other, than, in, reruns, of, MadTV,, Just, for, Laughs,, and, Laughing, Matters., If, you've, ever, been, fortunate, enough, to, see, them, on, TV, or, live, on, stage,, Phil, was, the, one, with, the, guitar, and, goofy, smile,, Greg, was, the, tall, guy, flailing, about, wildly,, and, Sean, was, the, one, doing, most, of, the, singing, and, impressions., The, group, was, around, for, over, 11, years,, with, the, final, performances, coming, in, the, late, 1990s., I, saw, them, for, the, first, time, on, their, 10th, anniversary, show, at, The, Rivoli, (Downtown, Toronto,, Queen, and, Spadina), on, December, 29,, 1997,, and, spent, most, of, the, night, howling, with, laughter, -, that, is,, except, for, the, occasional, part, where, I, was, just, stunned, and, confused., Because, so, much, of, their, act, is, obviously, improvised,, sometimes, it, gets, pretty, strange,, but, they, manage, to, bring, you, back, in, with, a, new, laugh, right, away., I, have, told, the, band, in, person, about, this, website, and, they, thanked, me, for, the, effort,, and, I, have, also, emailed, with, the, management, and, received, their, implicit, approval, (they, list, this, page, as, the, only, link, for, the, band, as, part, of, Sean, Cullen's, Biography)., But, that, doesn't, mean, it, is, an, official, site, -, in, fact,, to, my, knowledge, there, is, no, official, site., I'm, just, a, fan, who, wants, to, spread, the, word, about, this, very, cool, group., So, here, is, what, you, will, find, on, this, site:, Sound, Clips, (no, full, songs, -, just, sample, bits), Lyrics, (as, best, as, I, can, figure, them, out), A, Little, Off, The, Top, (Corky's, 1996, movie, debut), 10th, Anniversary, Message, (from, the, programme), Corky, Trivia, (ubiquitous, message, in, brackets), Links, (the, few, I, could, find), The, most, up-to-date, information, I, have, on, the, members, is:, Sean, is, still, represtented, by, Diamondfield, Entertainment,, and, has, his, own, site, at, www.seancullen.com., He, has, had, a, special, on, Comedy, Central,, appeared, in, a, bit, on, the, Montreal, Comedy, Festival, on, The, Tonight, Show, with, Jay, Leno,, and, had, a, CBC, show, in, 2003, called, The, Sean, Cullen, Show., Most, recently,, he, has, been, appearing, in, the, Toronto, production, of, "The, Producers"., Funny.co.uk, maintains, a, current, list, of, Phil's, upcoming, UK, appearances., There's, also, information, on, current, and, past, events, at, Chortle's, Phil, Nichol, page., In, October, 2003,, Kerry, reported, seeing, Phil, in, Doha,, Qatar., She, said,, "I, was, in, the, front, row, and, sang, 'I, used, my, grandma, as, a, skateboard', when, he, started,, so, he, dragged, me, onstage, and, we, sang, it, together, as, well, as, I'm, the, only, Gay, Eskimo., Good, Fun., Never, thought, I'd, see, them/him, here.", Thanks, for, the, update,, Kerry!, In, March, 2002,, several, fans, reported, seeing, Phil, perform, as, part, of, the, Adelaide, Fringe, Festival, doing, a, show, called, "Phil, Nichol, is, Stuck.", Nichol, sang, some, Corky, songs,, including, "Eskimo,", as, well, as, doing, his, own, stuff., A, fan, named, Andrew, reports, that, he, and, some, other, Canadian, friends, "met, Phil, in, the, hall, outside, the, show, and, when, he, found, out, we, were, from, Canada, he, started, into, an, impromptu, routine, which, lasted, until, the, show, started.", A, fan, named, Ken, said, of, the, show,, "Someone, in, the, crowd, was, heckling, him, in, French, so, he, got, him, up, on, stage, and, started, hitting, him, over, the, head, with, the, microphone., Quite, bizarre.", Thanks, for, the, reports!, Thanks, to, Cara, for, sending, information, that, Phil, was, nominated, for, an, award, in, the, 2002, Edinburgh, Festival,, and, a, link, to, a, story, about, Phil's, performance., Greg, went, up, north, in, Canada, to, teach, and, is, trying, to, publish, a, novel, called, "Heaven, Journals.", I've, seen, other, references, to, a, Green, travel, book, and, some, band, photography, in, the, UK,, but, I, don't, know, if,
