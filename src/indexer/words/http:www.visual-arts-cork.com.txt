the, same, period,, arose, from, a, background, of, Mannerism., The, earlier, style, was, self-conscious,, smooth,, elegant,, and, sometimes, icy., Baroque, masters, worked, in, a, manner, that, was, more, naturalistic,, and, was, often, genuinely, emotional, and, physically, vigorous., The, Baroque, style, in, sculpture, was, championed, early, on, by, Gian, Lorenzo, Bernini, (1598-1680),, whose, father, Pietro, practised, a, competent,, cool,, and, somewhat, fussy, version, of, Mannerism,, a, style, soon, rejected, by, his, son., Bernini, dominated, the, art, of, his, time., He, achieved, particular, fame, in, early, manhood, with, a, series, of, classical, and, biblical, figures, -, "Pluto, and, Proserpina", (1622),, "David", (1624),, and, "Apollo, and, Daphne", (1625), -, for, Cardinal, Scipione, Borghese., By, the, later, 1620s,, Bernini, had, developed, a, High, Baroque, style, with, ecstatic, actors,, active, draperies, and, almost, rubbery, figure, types, that, expressed, the, intense, state, of, ecstasy,, contemplation,, conversion, and, joy, in, martyrdom., Bernini,, skilled, also, in, painting,, architectural, design, and, theatrical, staging,, unified, the, visual, arts,, and, he, utilized, sculpture, as, part, of, the, whole., This, is, clearly, visible, in, the, Cornaro, Chapel, in, Santa, Maria, della, Vittoria,, where, his, sculpture, depicting, "The, Ecstasy, of, St, Teresa", (1652), appears, surrounded, by, members, of, the, Cornaro, family,, skeletons, coming, alive, in, the, pavement, and, a, host, of, angels, appearing, overhead,, one, of, whom, flies, down, to, visit, her., The, High, Baroque, manner, of, Bernini, and, others, had, to, compete, with, more, classicizing, strains, in, the, 17th, century., By, the, first, decade, of, that, century,, Stefano, Maderno, (1576-1636), established, a, naturalistic, and, vigorous, manner, inspired, by, the, art, of, antiquity., Francois, Duquesnoy, (1597-1643),, born, in, Brussels,, furthered, his, career, in, Rome, in, competition, with, Bernini., Duquesnoy, practised, a, Classicism, shared, by, the, painters, Andrea, Sacchi, (1599-1661), and, Nicolas, Poussin, (1594-1665)., Also, embracing, more, of, a, classical, tendency, than, Bernini, was, his, chief, rival, Alessandro, Algardi, (1598-1654),, whose, workshop, competed, with, Bernini's, for, commissions, in, the, papal, city., Other, leading, Baroque, sculptors, included, "the, Spanish, Michelangelo", Alonso, Cano, (1601-1667),, the, French, masters, Pierre, Puget, (1622-1694), and, Gaspard, and, Balthazar,
