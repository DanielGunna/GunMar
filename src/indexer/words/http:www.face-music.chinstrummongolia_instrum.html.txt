a, formantic, melody, from, harmonics., Several, techniques, are, known,, depending, on, the, vocal, source, and, the, place, of, resonance:, kharkhiraa, =, lung,, khamriin, =, nose,, tövönkhiin, =,

resonate, high, above, this, drone., Who, masters, this, singing, technique, may, even, make, the, overtone, sound, louder, then, the, fundamental, pitch,, so, the, drone, is, not, audible, anymore., A, different, technique, often, used, by, overtone, singers, combines, a, normal, glottal, pitch, with, the, low, frequency,, pulse-like, vibration, known, as, vocal, fry., The, Turkic, tribes, in,
