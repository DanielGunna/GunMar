Website, Content, By:, Jordan, Dick, Posted, in, Content, Strategy,, Web, Design, Planning, and, organizing, website, content, can, feel, overwhelming,, especially, if, you, have, a, lot, of, it., I‚Äôm, going, to, show, you, how, to, tackle, this, in, a, way, that, already, makes, sense, to, you., Your, website, navigation, is, like, a, restaurant, menu, Organize, your, website, content, into, logical, categories, like, a, restaurant, menu., Most, menus, are, usually, divided, into, categories,, and, subcategories., Pastas, go, with, pastas, and, burgers, go, with, burgers,, etc., Very, sensible., Here‚Äôs, the, right, way, to, do, it‚Ä¶, If, you, were, a, landscaper, offering, different, landscaping, services, like,, ‚Äúlandscape, lighting,‚Äù, ‚Äúlandscape, design,‚Äù, etc.,, you‚Äôd, want, all, those, services, under, one, category,, on, one, tab, of, your, main, menu., Just, like, the, example, below.¬†This, means, you, definitely, want, each, service, to, have, its, own, page., The, right, way:, With, individual, pages, for, each, service, in, the, dropdown., Here‚Äôs, the, wrong, way, to, organize, content‚Ä¶, Listing, all, of, your¬†services, on, one, page,, instead, of¬†individual, landing, pages,, is, a, beginner‚Äôs, mistake., From, a, search, engine, optimization, perspective,, it, can, be, a, very, costly, mistake, for, a, business., The, wrong, way:, Just, listing, all, services, on, one, page, and, not, having, individual, landing, pages, for, each, service, is, a, missed, opportunity, for, your, business., The, main, menu, should, clearly, tell, the, story, Your, main, menu, should, tell, your, visitors, exactly, what, they, are, going, to, get, at, a, glance., Creatively, conveying, this, message, in, your, menu, bar, is, great, if, you, can, do, it, in, a, way, that, doesn‚Äôt, make, the, visitor, have, to, guess, where, the, links, will, take, them., The, 3, most, common, pages, on, any, website, We, already, know, what, 3, of, the, pages, on, your, site, will, probably, be., Let‚Äôs, define, them., 1., Home, Page:¬†Often,, this, may, be, the, first, page, on, a, website, that, a, visitor, sees, (but, not, always, the, case.), At, a, glance,, your, home, page, should, identify, your, website‚Äôs, main, offer,, as, in, ‚Äúwhat, you, do,‚Äù, ‚Äúwho, you, do, it, for‚Äù, and, ‚Äúwhy, you‚Äôre, different.‚Äù, Tip:, As, shown, in, the, RT, Landscape, example, above,, a, descriptive, ‚Äútag, line‚Äù, (also, called, a, strap, line), near, your, company, name, or, logo, can, be, very, helpful, in, describing, what, you, do, at, a, glance., 2., About, Page:, Arguably, the, most, visited, page, on, one‚Äôs, site., This, page, usually, includes, some, background, info., It‚Äôs, also, a, great, opportunity, to, post, a, picture, of, yourself,, or, your, team., Show, some, personality, with, your, about, page., Tell, your, story, and, make, it, fun‚Ä¶, Example, of, a, creative, ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù, page, Personally,, I, have, never, been, a, big, fan, of, formal, ‚Äúbios,‚Äù, but, they, do, have, their, place., I, think, the, about, page, is, really, your, best, opportunity, to, take, some, creative, license, and, show, that, you‚Äôre, human., Your, visitors, will, connect, with, real, faces, and, authentic, copy., Tip:, While, writing, about, yourself,, creatively, tie-in, benefits, for, your, prospect, and, your, ‚Äúabout‚Äù, page, becomes, that, much, more, engaging., See, this, great, ‚Äúabout, page‚Äù, article, on, Copyblogger, that, touches, on, the, idea, of¬†not, making, your, about, page, all, about, you., 3., Contact, Page:, This, is, an, easy, one., Here‚Äôs, where, you, put, your, contact, info,, a, contact, form, and, possibly, a, link, for, driving, directions, if, applicable., Testimonials, can, go, here, as, well,, and, don‚Äôt, forget, a, link, to, your, Google, Places/Plus, business, listing, and, and, social, media, profiles., How, many, pages, do, I, need, on, my, website?, The, short, answer, is,, every, service, you, provide, needs, its, own, landing, page., Lumping, all, of, your, services, on, one, page, is, a, missed, opportunity, for, your, business, and, here‚Äôs, why‚Ä¶, Why, multiple, landing, pages, are, key, Back, to, the, restaurant, concept., Not, all, of, your, visitors, will, enter, through, the, front, door, of, your¬†restaurant,, (your, home, page)., A, well, optimized, site,, funnels, traffic, through, multiple, entry, points, (landing, pages)., You, can, create, lots, of, different, pages, for, visitors, to, land, on, through, search, engines., If, you, offer, many, different, types, of, services,, having, a, page, for, each, of, those, services, provides, multiple, entry, points, into, your, website., If, you, can, solve, different, types, of, problems, for, people,, then, you, need, different, pages,, explaining, how, your, product, or, service, can, solve, a, particular, problem., Again,, this, touches, on, more, advanced, concepts, in, content, marketing, and, search, engine, optimization., Even, if, you‚Äôre, a, beginner,, and, have, no, clue, about, ‚Äúlanding, pages,‚Äù, or, you‚Äôre, just, working, on, assembling, content, for, your, web, designer,, take, my, advice, and, break, your, services, into, individual, dedicated, pages., Do, you, know, your, target, audience?, Having, a, solid, understanding, of, your, target, audience, and, what, their, needs, are,, can, help, you, decide, what, type, of, content, to, include, on, your, website., These, questions, can, serve, as, inspiration, for, developing, your, content:, Who, are, you, building, this, website, for?, What, are, your, visitor‚Äôs, needs?, What, are, their, pain, points?, How, can, you, resolve, their, doubts, and, concerns?, Will, your, website, be, able, to, easily, fulfill, your, visitor‚Äôs, needs?, Are, you, answering, their, basic, questions?, Are, you, speaking, to, them, in, language, they, can, understand, (their, language.), How, will, you, substantiate, your, claims?, E.g.,, testimonials,, social, proof,, etc., Are, you, guiding, your, visitors, to, do, something, on, your, site,, like, take, a, next, step?, Is, there, a, ‚Äúcall, to, action?‚Äù, E.g.,, sign, up, for, a, newsletter,, make, a, purchase,, submit, a, contact, form,, visit, a, next, page,, etc., Let‚Äôs, Recap, If, you, gave, some, of, the, preceding, questions, some, thought,, you, probably, have, some, content, ideas., Your, main, pages, will, likely, serve, as, your, main, categories., For, example,, a, health, club, website, might, use, ‚ÄúFitness, Classes‚Äù, as, a, main, category, on, the, nav, bar., Using, a, drop-down, menu, under, the, category, of, ‚ÄúFitness, Classes,‚Äù, they, might, list, other, pages, like,, ‚ÄúYoga, Classes‚Äù, or, ‚ÄúAerobics, Classes,‚Äù, etc., Remember,, it‚Äôs, in, your, best, interest, to, create, separate, pages, for, each, service., Using, the, preceding, example,, this, means, each, type, of, fitness, class, should, have, its, own, landing, page., Following, some, of, the, advice, outlined, in, this, guide, should, help, streamline, the, website, planning, process, for, you., If, you, would, like, to, leave, a, comment, below,, I‚Äôd, love, to, hear, from, you., Or, contact, me, direct, if, you, have, any, questions., Tags:, Website, Content, Comments, Amy, Ling, says:, February, 1,, 2016, at, 8:00, pm, Question!, I‚Äôm, building, a, tattoo, website,, the, services, they, offer, are, strictly, tattoos, only, but, they, offer, different, styles, like, custom, design,, trash, polka,, cover, ups, and, mastectomy., Would, it, be, a, good, idea, to, make, each, tattoo, type, it‚Äôs, own, page, too?, Reply, Jordan, Dick, says:, February, 4,, 2016, at, 4:22, am, Hi, Amy,, Yes,, I, would, agree, that, the, use, of, highly, focused, landing, pages, for, the, different, types, of, tattoos, is, the, way, to, go., I, think, there, is, lot‚Äôs, of, potential, for, your, site, to, get, found, via, Google, search, for, some, of, the, phrases, you, mentioned, and, probably, for, a, ton, more, that, you, didn‚Äôt, mention., A, quick, search, using, the, Google, Adwords, Keyword, Planner, shows, about, 4,000, queries, nationally, for, the, phrase,, ‚Äútrash, polka, tattoos.‚Äù, And, the, competition, is, low!, I, could, also, see, there, being, an, opportunity, to, create, lot‚Äôs, of, content, around, mastectomy, and, tattooing., Again,, another, search, using, the, Google, Keyword, Planner,, shows, about, 1,900, queries/mo, and, low, competition, nationally., Being, that, tattoos, are, visual,, optimizing, your, images, well,, with, descriptive, file, names,, alt, and, title, tags, will, also, help, you, get, found., Hope, that, helps,, Jordan, Reply, Module, 4:,

much., I, just, started, my, own, business, and, trying, to, design, the, website, for, it., I, have, never, deigned, any, professional, website, before, so, I, am, kind, of, all, over, the, place., Your, blog, has, given, me, lots, of, ideas, in, organizing, my, site., I, also, want, to, know, what, information, should, be, on, the, homepage., thank, you., Reply, Jordan, Dick, says:, September, 3,, 2016, at, 7:19, pm, Thanks, for, the, kind, words, Clifford., I, couldn‚Äôt, say, what, specifically, should, be, on, a, home, page, without, knowing, more, about, the, market., But, in, broad, terms,, your, home, page, should, be, an, overview, of, your, core, offering(s)., For, some, businesses, this, could, mean, that, they, are, serving, different, segments, of, a, marke,, (e.g.,, commercial, and, residential)., Or, it, could, mean, that, they, are, providing, some, core, services, to, solve, different, types, of, problems, for, the, same, or, different, type(s), of, customers., Whatever, your, core, services, are,, you‚Äôll, want, to, highlight, those, services, and, provide, links, to, landing, pages, that, lead, your, visitors, toward, the, information, they, need, to, see, and, ultimately, towards, conversion., When, organizing, a, home, page,, one, of, the, most, important, things, is, to, have, a, headline, that, really, captures, your, value, proposition., What‚Äôs, the, overarching, benefit, that, you, are, offering, your, prospects?, Why, should, they, bother, to, read, on?, If, you, don‚Äôt, nail, this,, you, stand, an, excellent, chance, of, losing, your, visitor, within, the, first, few, seconds., Think, about, the, headline, on, a, newspaper., You, might, glance, at, it, in, the, store., It, may, grab, your, attention, or, it, may, not., Your, headline, can, make, or, break, your, home, page‚Ä¶, or, any, page, for, that, matter., Hope, this, was, helpful., Reply, Gina, says:, September, 15,, 2016, at, 11:40, pm, Thank, you, for, the, article,, it, was, very, helpful., I, had, a, quick, thought, on, if, a, business, offers, services, and, different, programs, offering, the, same, services, (just, tailored, to, different, audience), would, it, still, be, an, intelligent, idea, to, have, separate, landing, pages, for, each, service, program?, But,, they, all, include, the, same, tools, used, to, give, the, service, and, ‚Äúcustomers‚Äù, are, either, ‚Äúpatients‚Äù, or, ‚Äúmembers‚Äù, yet, patients, can, be, members, too., I, guess, it, comes, down, to, the, ‚Äúselling‚Äù, of, the, service,, because, each, customer, or, ‚Äúpatient‚Äù, can, either, purchase, a, package, or, become, a, member., Any, thoughts?, Suggestions?, Reply, Jordan, Dick, says:, September, 16,, 2016, at, 1:49, pm, Hi, Gina,, that‚Äôs, really, good, question, you, asked, there., This, scenario, comes, up, frequently,, where, the, business‚Äôs, product, or, service, can, solve, different, kinds, of, problems, for, different, kinds, of, people., The, approach, is, a, longterm, content, marketing, strategy., You, would, do, this, by, tailoring, your, blog, content, to, speak, directly, to, the, problems, faced, by, the, different, audience, segments., You, would, use, your, articles, to, lead, the, prospect, through, your, articles, towards, your, solution, (your, sales, pages.), For, example,, let‚Äôs, use, this, article, of, mine, that, you, landed, on., You, landed, here, because, you, had, a, problem., You, wanted, to, know, how, to, better, organize, content, on, your, web, site,, right?, Now,, think, about, that, for, a, moment., Who, would, Google, such, a, thing?, People, in, all, kinds, of, different, situations., People, building, their, own, sites., Professionals, helping, businesses, with, their, client‚Äôs, site,, students,, etc., Some, of, these, folks, may, be, my, type, of, customer., Many, may, not,, and, thats, ok, too., This, article, was, actually, created, some, time, ago, because, I, had, a, client, ask, me, how, they, should, organize, their, content., That, was, a, real, client, problem,, and, it‚Äôs, just, one, type, of, problem, that, my, clients, typically, have., So, the, idea, is, to, provide, useful, problem, solving, content, that, addresses, your, prospect‚Äôs, problem., For, my, business,, when, people, are, getting, ready, to, create, a, website,, sometimes, they, start, creating, content, for, it., i.e.,, ‚ÄúI, already, know, I, need, website,, but, how, will, I, organize, it.‚Äù, This, is, one, way, to, attract, potential, business, with, your, site., You, demonstrate, your, expertise, through, your, problem, solving, articles., Of, course,, many, people, will, find, what, they, need, and, leave,, but, some, will, reach, out, to, you‚Ä¶, **BUT,, if, you, had, another, article, to, refer, them, to, that, furthers, their, awareness, and, brings, them, closer, to, understanding, how, your, solution, can, solve, their, problem,, then, you, have, the, makings, of, a, content, marketing, funnel., Basically,, you, are, taking, visitors, on, a, journey, towards, your, solution, (your, sales, page), and, that, journey, can, begin, at, any, number, of, stages, based, on, the, awareness, your, prospect, has, of, their, problem, and, your, solution,, and, the, stage, they, are, at, with, their, problem., I, think, I, just, created, the, beginnings, of, another, blog, post, right, here., üôÇ, Reply, Gina, says:, September, 16,, 2016, at, 4:48, pm, You, rock., Reply, Jordan, Dick, says:, September, 16,, 2016, at, 5:06, pm, Well, thank, you, much, üôÇ, Reply, Dustin, Thornton, says:, October, 12,, 2016, at, 2:53, pm, Great, article!, I, am, working, on, a, website, for, a, company, that, offers, many, types, of, services, in, different, geographical, locations., After, doing, some, research,, it, appears, that, for, SEO, purposes, each, geographical, location, needs, it‚Äôs, own, subdomain, or, subdirectory,, but, also, each, service, needs, it‚Äôs, own, landing, page, (according, to, this, article)., What, advice, do, you, have, for, how, to, organize, such, a, website?, Reply, Jordan, Dick, says:, October, 12,, 2016, at, 4:41, pm, Dustin,, Much, depends, on, the, service, and, how, the, business, is, set, up., Does, this, business, have, multiple, offices, with, unique, phone, numbers, in, different, geographic, locations?, If, it, does,, then, it, should, be, taking, advantage, of, multiple, Google, business, listings, (one, for, each, geographic, location.), That, will, allow, the, business, to, show, in, the, local, search, results, for, a, given, geographic, area., That, said,, if, they, are, indeed, taking, advantage, of, multiple, business, listings,, then, each, of, those, listings, should, be, pointing, to, a, website, page, on, your, site, for, each, location., I, use, the, Yoast, Local, SEO, plugin, for, setting, up, WordPress, sites, with, multiple, locations., To, answer, your, question, about, sub, domains, versus, sub, directories, ‚Ä¶, There, has, been, lot‚Äôs, of, talk, on, this, over, the, years., The, Yoast, plugin, I, use,, uses, subdirectories, like, so,, http://yourbranddotcom/locations/your-city/., That, would, confirm¬†that, the, subdirectory, approach, is, best,, as, Yoast, is, the, expert, in, WordPress, SEO., Rand, Fishkin‚Äôs, (excellent, resource), site, has, a, pretty, good, article, on, this, topic, Article, on, subdomain, vs., subdirectory, for, SEO., And, Matt, Cutts, (Google, Engineer), posted, an, Often, referred, to, article, on, multiple, locations, on, multiple, locations¬†a, number, of, years, ago., And, if, all, that, didn‚Äôt, confuse, you,, here‚Äôs, Another, good, article, from, a, highly, respected, resource, that, leans, more, towards, subdomains,, which, is, probably, not, the, way, I, would, approach, it,, but, it, comes, from, a, respected, resource., Reply, Madeline, Yau, says:, October, 19,, 2016, at,

static, content, would, be, used, for, product/service, pages,, informational, support, pages,, etc., These, are, the, pages, you, would, want, to, push, people, towards, because, that‚Äôs, where, you, would, put, your, offer(s)., These, are, the, pages, that, do, the, selling., Of, course,, your, ‚Äúabout‚Äù, page, and, ‚ÄòfAQ‚Äôs‚Äù, page, are, not, directly, doing, selling,, but, they, would, also, be, static, pages, as, you, pointed, out., People, often, get, confused, about, what, a, blog, post, is,, as, apposed, to, a, ‚Äúpage‚Äù, on, your, website., The, main, difference, is, that, blog, posts, are, organized, and, archived, by, date,, where, as, a, static, page, is, not., It‚Äôs, just, there., It‚Äôs, not, included, in, the, hierarchy, of, latest, posts, and, it, doesn‚Äôt, get, stored, into, your, blog, post, archives., Blog, content, is, generally, informational, content., That, doesn‚Äôt, mean, that, it, can‚Äôt, do, some, selling, for, you,, but, when, we, talk, about, blog, content, used, for, marketing, purposes,, the, selling, is, done, indirectly, and, subtly., It‚Äôs, done, through, education., In, the, same, way, that, you, found, this, blog,

and, WordPress, would, certainly, allow, you, to, add, a, category, page, as, a, link, in, the, main, menu., Ideally,, I, would, need, to, know, more, about, your, business, and, your, objectives, to,
