Media, Extensions, 6, April, 2017, |, Archive, UNESCO, recently, published, a, letter, and, an, article, about, Encrypted, Media, Extensions., Since, we, didn’t, have, an, opportunity, to, set, the, record, straight, with, them,, we, are, responding, here., The, spirit, of, the, letter, is, anchored, in, UNESCO’s, values, and, the, concept, of, Internet, Universality., We, agree, on, the, concept, of, Internet, Universality., We, even, believe, that, those, who, are, trying, to, restrict, movies, from, the, Internet, are, violating, the, concept, of, universality, by, preventing, certain, content, from, being, on, the, Web., We, note, that, EME, does, in, fact, provide, improvements, in, privacy,, security, and, accessibility, over, the, alternatives., The, alternative, to, EME, allowing, interaction, with, copyrighted, content, in, Web, browser, plugins, is, abandoning, the, Web., Without, in-browser, decryption, ability,, content, providers, would, use, their, own, native, application,, which, will, have, much, more, leeway, to, spy, on, the, user,, and, possibly, infect, their, machine., With, EME,, the, browser, can, protect, the, user, from, the, worst, effects, of, the, DRM, system,, by, putting, it, in, a, processing, “sandbox”,, such, that, access, to, network,, user’s, data, or, machine, is, only, permitted, as, allowed, by, the, sandbox,, thus, offering, protection, against, things, like, the, root, kit, problems, and, privacy, breaches, we, have, had, in, the, past., Regarding, accessibility,, analysis, and, testing, confirmed, that, the, specification’s, approach, to, captions,, transcripts, and, audio, description, does, not, block, access, to, this, accessibility, information., Moreover,, since, EME, recommends, that, accessibility, information, is, transmitted, without, any, encryption,, it, is, particularly, suited, (EME, and, accessibility), for, accessible, and, legal, fair, use, where, accessibility, is, concerned, –, including, accessibility, adaptations, to, the, video, stream, itself., When, UNESCO, suggests, that, laws, such, as, DMCA, are, against, UN, principles,, we, note, that, their, colleagues, at, WIPO, have, been, a, motivating, force, behind, such, laws., We, would, urge, UNESCO, to, use, its, own, weight, to, insist, that, Member, States’, laws, on, the, Internet, are, always, reasonable, and, proportionate, and, respectful, of, human, rights., We, are, a, technical, standards, organization, but, litigating, the, laws, of, a, single, country, or, many, nations, (like, the, WIPO, treaty), is, the, role, of, legal, advocates, such, as, the, EFF, or, UNESCO., EFF, has,, as, a, member, of, the, Consortium,, initiated, a, move, to, get, the, members, of, the, working, group, developing, EME, to, agree, to, a, covenant, that, they, would, not, sue, under, the, DMCA,, but, the, proposal, was, rejected, by, the, Members., Following, that,, the, Consortium, is, considering, a, strawman, broader, Best, Practices, document, W3C, Security, Disclosures, and, Privacy, Best, Practices, to, protect, Security, researchers, and, others, from, the, overreach, of, the, law., We, invite, the, public,, experts,, W3C, Members, and, interested, parties, to, advocate, and, get, consensus, on, any, changes, needed, to, better, help, support, researchers, in, security, and, privacy., We, intend, to, continue, to, address, the, public, discourse, with, an, update, to, our, March, 2016, Information, about, W3C, and, Encrypted, Media, Extensions., Sir, Tim, Berners-Lee, named, recipient, of, the, ACM, A.M., Turing, Award, 4, April, 2017, |, Archive, Today,, Tuesday, 4, April,, the, ACM,, the, Association, for, Computing, Machinery,, named, Sir, Tim, Berners-Lee,, inventor, of, the, Web, and, Director, of, the, World, Wide, Web, Consortium,, as, the, recipient, of, the, 2016, ACM, A.M., Turing, Award., The, Turing, award, is, recognized, as, the, highest, distinction, in, Computer, Science, and, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, “Nobel, Prize, of, Computing.”, Sir, Tim, is, being, given, this, award, for, inventing, the, World, Wide, Web,, the, first, web, browser,, and, the, fundamental, protocols, and, algorithms, allowing, the, Web, to, scale., The, Web, is, considered, one, of, the, most, influential, computing, innovations, in, history., Sir, Tim’s, development, and, guardianship, of, the, building, blocks, of, the, Web,, the, standards, upon, which, it, is, built, upon,, continues, at, W3C., Jeff, Jaffe,, CEO, of, W3C,, stated:, “The, Web, has, had, an, immense, impact, on, the, world;, transforming, every, part, of, society:, how, we, communicate,, how, we, learn,, how, we, acquire, information,, and, how, we, engage, in, commerce., Tim’s, soaring, vision, of, what, was, possible, in, the, world, is, anchored, on, breakthrough, contributions, to, computing, –, which, is, what, is, recognized, by, the, Turing, Award.”, For, more, information, on,

Accessibility, Conformance, Testing, (ACT), Rules, Format, 1.0, has, been, published, as, a, First, Public, Working, Draft., It, specifies, a, common, format, for, accessibility, test, rules,, and, how, to, write, test, procedures, for, quality, assurance., It, facilitates, harmonization, of, accessibility, testing, approaches,, and, helps, organizations, to, better, document, and, share, their,

March, 2017, |, Archive, The, Browser, Testing, and, Tools, Working, Group, invites, implementation, of, the, Candidate, Recommendation, of, WebDriver., WebDriver, is, a, remote, control, interface, that, enables, introspection, and, control, of, user, agents., It, provides, a, platform, and, language-neutral, wire, protocol, as, a, way, for, out-of-process, programs, to, remotely, instruct, the, behavior, of, web, browsers, as, well, as, a, set, of, interfaces, to, discover, and, manipulate, DOM, elements, in, web, documents, and, to, control, the, behavior, of, a, user, agent., It, is, primarily, intended, to, allow, web, authors, to, write, tests, that, automate, a, user, agent, from, a, separate, controlling, process,, but, may, also, be, used, in, such, a, way, as, to, allow, in-browser, scripts, to, control, a, possibly, separate, browser., Spatial, Data, on, the, Web, Best, Practices, Note, Published, 30, March, 2017, |, Archive, The, Spatial, Data, on, the, Web, Working, Group, has, published, a, Group, Note, of, Spatial, Data, on, the, Web, Best, Practices., This, document, advises, on, best, practices, related, to, the, publication, and, usage, of, spatial, data, on, the, Web;, the, use, of, Web, technologies, as, they, may, be, applied, to, location., The, best, practices, are, intended, for, practitioners,, including, Web, developers, and, geospatial, experts,, and, are, compiled, based, on, evidence, of, real-world, application., These, best, practices, suggest, a, significant, change, of, emphasis, from, traditional, Spatial, Data, Infrastructures, by, adopting, a, Linked, Data, approach., As, location, is, often, the, common, factor, across, multiple, datasets,, spatial, data, is, an, especially, useful, addition, to, the, Linked, Data, cloud;, the, 5, Stars, of, Linked, Data, paradigm, is, promoted, where, relevant., W3C, Invites, Implementations, of, Resource, Timing, Level, 1, 30, March, 2017, |, Archive, The, Web,

access, the, complete, timing, information, for, resources, in, a, document., User, latency, is, an, important, quality, benchmark, for, Web, Applications., While, JavaScript-based, mechanisms, can, provide, comprehensive, instrumentation, for, user, latency, measurements, within, an, application,, in, many, cases,, they, are, unable, to, provide, a, complete, end-to-end, latency, picture., This, document, introduces, the, PerformanceResourceTiming, interface, to, allow, JavaScript, mechanisms, to, collect, complete, timing, information, related, to, resources, on, a, document., Navigation, Timing, 2, extends, this, specification, to, provide, additional, timing, information, associated, with, a, navigation., W3C, Invites, Implementations, of, Page, Visibility, Level, 2, 28, March, 2017,
