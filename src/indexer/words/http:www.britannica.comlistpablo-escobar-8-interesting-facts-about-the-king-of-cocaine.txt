Female, Jazz, Singers, Technology, List, 7, Deadliest, Weapons, in, History, More, than, two, decades, after, his, death,, Pablo, Escobar, remains, as, well, known, as, he, was, during, his, heyday, as, the, head, of, the, Medellín, drug, cartel., His, fixture, in, popular, culture, is, largely, thanks, to, countless, books,, movies,, and, songs., We’ve, decided, to, make, our, contribution, with, a, list, of, facts, about, the, life, of, the, larger-than-life, Escobar., Rise, to, Power, Escobar,, the, son, of, a, farmer, and, a, schoolteacher,, began, his, life, of, crime, while, still, a, teenager., According, to, some, reports,, his, first, illegal, scheme, was, selling, fake, diplomas., He, then, branched, out, into, falsifying, report, cards, before, smuggling, stereo, equipment, and, stealing, tombstones, in, order, to, resell, them., Escobar, also, stole, cars,, and, it, was, this, offense, that, resulted, in, his, first, arrest,, in, 1974., Shortly, thereafter,, he, became, an, established, drug, smuggler,, and, by, the, mid-1970s, he, had, helped, found, the, crime, organization, that, evolved, into, the, Medellín, cartel., Mucho, Dinero, At, the, height, of, its, power,, the, Medellín, cartel, dominated, the, cocaine, trade,, earning, an, estimated, $420, million, a, week, and, making, its, leader, one, of, the, wealthiest, people, in, the, world., With, a, reported, worth, of, $25, billion,, Escobar, had, ample, money, to, spend—and, he, did., His, lavish, lifestyle, included, private, planes,, luxurious, homes, (see, below),, and, over-the-top, parties., In, the, late, 1980s, he, reportedly, offered, to, pay, off, his, country’s, debt, of, $10, billion, if, he, would, be, exempt, from, any, extradition, treaty., In, addition,, while, his, family, was, on, the, run, in, 1992–93,, Escobar, reportedly, burned, $2, million, in, order, to, keep, his, daughter, warm., Despite, his, best, efforts,, however,, even, Escobar, couldn’t, spend, all, that, money,, and, much, of, it, was, stored, in, warehouses, and, fields., According, to, his, brother,, about, 10%,, or, $2.1, billion,, was, written, off, annually—eaten, by, rats, or, destroyed, by, the, elements., In, some, cases,, it, was, simply, lost., Hacienda, Nápoles, Escobar, owned, a, number, of, palatial, homes,, but, his, most-notable, property, was, the, 7,000-acre, estate, known, as, Hacienda, Nápoles, (named, after, Naples,, Italy),, located, between, Bogotá, and, Medellín., Reportedly, costing, $63, million,, it, included, a, soccer, field,, dinosaur, statues,, artificial, lakes,, a, bullfighting, arena,, the, charred, remains, of, a, classic, car, collection, destroyed, by, a, rival, cartel,, an, airstrip,, a, tennis, court,, and, a, zoo, (more, on, that, later)., The, estate—the, front, gate, of, which, is, topped, by, the, plane, he, used, on, his, first, drug, run, to, the, U.S.—was, later, looted, by, locals,, and, it, is, now, a, popular, tourist, attraction., King, of, the, Jungle, Escobar’s, private, zoo, was, home, to, some, 200, animals,, including, elephants,, ostriches,, zebras,, camels,, and, giraffes., Many, of, the, creatures, were, smuggled, into, the, country, aboard, Escobar’s, drug, planes., After, his, death, in, 1993,, most, of, the, animals, were, transferred, to, zoos., However,, four, hippopotamuses, were, left, behind., They, soon, multiplied,, and, by, 2016, upwards, of, 40, lived, in, the, area., The, potentially, dangerous, animals, have, damaged, farms, and, inspired, fear, in, locals., Authorities, began, castrating, male, hippos, in, an, effort, to, control, the, population., Robin, Hood, Perhaps, hoping, to, win, the, support, of, everyday, Colombians,, Escobar, became, known, for, his, philanthropic, efforts,, which, led, to, the, nickname, “Robin, Hood.”, He, built, hospitals,, stadiums,, and, housing, for, the, poor., He, even, sponsored, local, soccer, teams., His, popularity, with, many, Colombians, was, demonstrated, when, he, was, elected, to, an, alternate, seat, in, the, country’s, Congress, in, 1982., Alas,, two, years, later, he, was, forced, to, resign, after, a, campaign, to, expose, his, criminal, activities., The, justice, minister, who, led, the, efforts, was, assassinated., “Plata, o, Plomo”, Escobar’s, way, of, handling, problems, was, “plata, o, plomo,”, meaning, “silver”, (bribes), or, “lead”, (bullets)., While, he, preferred, the, former,, he, had, no, qualms, about, the, latter, option,, earning, a, reputation, for, ruthlessness., He, reportedly, killed, some, 4,000, people,, including, numerous, police, officers, and, government, officials., In, 1989, the, cartel, was, blamed, for, detonating, a, bomb, on, a, plane, that, was, carrying, an, alleged, informant., Some, 100, people, died., La, Catedral, In, 1991, Escobar, offered, to, turn, himself, in, to, authorities—if, he, was, allowed, to, build, his, own, prison., Surprisingly—or, perhaps, not—Colombian, officials, agreed., The, result, was, the, luxurious, La, Catedral., Not, only, did, the, facility, include, a, nightclub,, a, sauna,, a, waterfall,, and, a, soccer, field;, it, also, had, telephones,, computers,, and, fax, machines., However,, after, Escobar, tortured, and, killed, two, cartel, members, at, La, Catedral,, officials, decided, to, move, him, to, a, less-accommodating, prison., Before, he, could, be, transferred,, however,, Escobar, escaped,, in, July, 1992., And, that, brings, us, to…, The, King, Is, Muerto, After, his, escape,, the, Colombian, government—reportedly, aided, by, U.S., officials, and, rival, drug, traffickers—launched, a, massive, manhunt., On, December, 2,, 1993,, Escobar, celebrated, his, 54th, birthday,, allegedly, enjoying, cake,, wine,, and, marijuana., The, next, day,, his, hideout, in, Medellín, was, discovered., While, Colombian, forces, stormed, the, building,, Escobar, and, a, bodyguard, managed, to, get, to, the, roof., A, chase, and, gunfight, ensued,, and, Escobar, was, fatally, shot., Some,, however,, have, speculated, that, Escobar, took, his, own, life., The, drug, lord,, who, faced, possible, extradition, to, the, U.S., if, arrested,, had, once, said, that, he, “would, rather, have, a, grave, in, Colombia, than, a, jail, cell, in, the, U.S.”, Previous, List, Order, in,
