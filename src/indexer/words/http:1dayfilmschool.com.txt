that, you’ve, really, wanted, to, make, for, some, time, now. , It’s, something, special. , Something, original. , Something, that, can, get, your, name, on, the, map, in, Hollywood, –, not, to, mention, possibly, make, you, a, truckload, of, money., But,, you, have, two, big, problems:, 1) , You, don't, have, much, money., 2) , You’ve, never, actually, made, a, feature, film, before., So,, what, are, your, options?, 1) , Spend, tens, of, thousands, of, dollars, (and, several, years, of, your, life), going, to, some, fancy, film, school., 2) , Spend, hundreds, of, dollars, to, download, and, READ, some, "online, course", by, someone, who, doesn't, have, much, of, a, track, record., 3) , Spend, about, $400.00, for, an, over-crowded, weekend, course, where, you’ll, sit, in, a, stuffy, conference, room,, battling, with, a, hundred, other, students, trying, to, get, one, of, your, "dozens", of, questions, answered..., ...But, why? , When,, instead,, you, can, deal, directly, on, a, ONE-ON-ONE, level, with, an, established,, experienced,, feature, filmmaker, who, has…, a) , Written/Produced, &, Directed, FOUR, Feature, Films, with, stars, such, as, Leslie, Nielsen,, Linda, Blair,, Ned, Beatty, and, Corey, Feldman, among, many,, many, others., b) , Written/Produced, &, Directed, over, two, dozen, Network, Television, Pilots,, Specials,, and, Direct-to-Video, Programs, (including, a, novelty, DVD, series, that, sold, over, two, million, DVDs, and, was, featured, on, "Howard, Stern,", "The, Maury, Show", and, ABC’s, "20/20.", c) , Shot, feature, films, in, both, 35mm, and, digital, formats,, with, budgets, ranging, from, $13, million, to, as, little, as, $50,000., And, what, if, this, man, can, teach, you, all, you, need, to, know, to, make, a, feature, film, in, ONE, DAY? , And, for, LESS, THAN, $100?, Just, Who, is, This, Filmmaker? , Well,, I, suppose, that, would, be, me. , Hi. , My, name, is, Bob, Logan. , My, friends, call, me, Bobby. , To, acquaint, you, with, what, I, do, for, a, living,, here, are, a, few, pics, of, me, at, work:, With, the, late, Jack, "Eraserhead", Nance, on, the, Bass, Lake,, CA., set, of, "Meatballs, 4", Directing, Linda, Blair, on, the, set, of, my, "Exorcist", spoof,, "Repossessed", Visiting, with, a, guest, in-between, shots, of, my, latest, movie,, "Yard, Sale", I, began, my, career, as, a, comedy, writer, for, such, comics, as, Joan, Rivers,, Garry, Shandling,, Rodney, Dangerfield, and, Sam, Kinison, (among, many,, many, others). , From, there, I, began, writing, for, many, television, variety, programs,, then, got, into, writing, motion, picture, screenplays., BTW,, if, you'd, like, to, see, my, resume, (with, my, latest, credits, only),, click, HERE, In, the, mid, 80s, I, began, writing,, producing, and, directing, the, first, of, many, Direct-To-Video, Specials, –, many, of, which, made, buckets, of, money. , Then,, in, 1988,, I, wrote, and, directed, my, first, independent, feature, film,, a, quirky, romantic-comedy, called, "Up, Your, Alley", starring, Linda, Blair, and, Murray, "The, Unknown, Comic", Langston. , I, made, the, film, for, waaaay, under, $100,000.,  It, made, over, $2.2, million, in, sales., From, there, I, went, on, to, create,, produce, and, direct, many, TV, Specials, and, Network, TV, pilots,, plus, several, other, feature, films,, including, my, latest, romantic-comedy, "Yard, Sale", which, will, be, released, later, this, summer, (check, out, the, posters, below):,    ,    ,    , Currently, I'm, developing, the, classic, 1960s, ABC-TV, comedy-western, series, "F, TROOP", into, my, next, studio, feature, film. , And, having, a, blast, doing, it!,      ,    ,    ,       , Blah,, blah,, blah…, okay,, enough, resume, waving. , Now, that, you, know, a, bit, about, me,, let’s, get, down, to, the, two, questions, that, are, probably, on, your, mind., 1) , Why, have, I, decided, to, pass, on, all, of, my, filmmaking, knowledge, to, you?, 2) , And, especially, at, such, a, ridiculously, low, price!, Look…, it’s, simple. , It’s, basically, about, me, "paying, it, forward." , Giving, back, in, order, to, honor, those, who, helped, me, when, I, first, started, off, in, the, film, business., And, as, far, as, the, $99, goes, -, I, mean,, c'mon, –, do, you, really, think, I'm, going, to, get, rich, giving, away, all, of, my, experience, and, knowledge, to, you, for, only, $99.00?! , You, kiddin’, me?! , That's, barely, a, round, of, lattes, for, me, and, a, few, friends, at, Starbucks. , I’m, all, about, helping, future, filmmakers, the, same, way, that, some, wonderful, people, helped, me, when, I, was, first, starting, out. , That’s, my, objective. , To, show, you, how, to, get, your, film, made, –, from, story, creation, to, casting, –, from, shooting, to, editing, –, from, final, mix, to, distribution, –, and, all, while, helping, to, "demystify", the, overall, filmmaking, process., Is, making, a, feature, film, difficult? , Absolutely. , But,, it, ain’t, rocket, science, either,, people! , Believe, me…, if, I, could, do, it,, you, can, do, it!,  , What, Will, I, Learn, at, the, 1-Day, $99.00, Film, School?, Simply, put, –, everything, you’ll, need, to, know, to, make, and, market, your, feature, film. , Period. , No, film, theory, or, conceptual, criticism, here,, kids. , Just, the, rock, solid, facts, and, insights, that, you, will, require, in, order, to, effectively, (and, cost, consciously), get, it, done. , Period. , No, matter, what, your, budget, -, I, will, show, you, how, to, get, it, all, on, the, screen.     , The, 1-Day, $99, Film, School, is, presented, in, three, segments, (told, in, a, light,, fun,, engaging, manner, -, even, if, I, do, say, so, myself). , Each, segment, lasts, approximately, 2½-3, hours. , Here, is, but, a, small, sample, of, the, subjects, I, will, cover:, Part, 1, -, "Creative, Elements",  Coming, up, with, a, clever,, commercial, idea,  The, script, –, length,, 3-act, structure,, etc.,  What, does, the, audience, want? , And, how, to, give, it, to, them,  What, do, distributors, want? , What, elements, are, important?,  The, genres, that, are, always, in, demand,  How, to, direct/handle, actors,  To, see, what, a, screenwriter, goes, through,, click, here, Part, 2, -, "Technical, Requirements",  Crew, positions,  Hiring, the, right, crew, –, and, at, the, right, price,  Getting, your, film, equipment, -, for, little, or, no, money, How, you, don't, have, to, know, a, thing, about, technology, Part, 3, -, "Business",  Shopping, your, completed, film,  Dealing, with, distributors,  The, politics, of, film, festivals,  The, business, of, casting, –, you, need, names, to, sell, the, film,  Producing, a, high-quality, film, on, a, shoestring, budget, ...And, Much,, Much,, More.,  , My, goal, is, to, impart, as, much, information, as, humanly, possible, to, the, members, of, this, class. , And, if, there’s, ever, something, that, you’d, like, to, know, that, I, may, not, have, covered, to, your, satisfaction,, just, ask! , I, LOVE, answering, questions, about, filmmaking. , ANY, question., A, typical, 1-Day, $99, Film, School, class, lasts, approximately, 7, hours,, with, a, 1-hour, break, for, lunch. , Classes, are, held, on, Saturdays, (except, on, Holidays). , They, begin, at, 10:00am, and, generally, end, around, 5:00pm. , And, the, classes, are, held, in, the, privacy, of, my, residence, –, which, makes, for, a, very, warm,, private,, comforting, environment, (as, opposed, to, a, boring,, restrictive, conference, room)., ...Heck,, I'll, even, spring, for, a, FREE, breakfast, of, donuts,, coffee,, bottled, water, &, soft, drinks, Plus, –, because, I, want, to, give, each, class, member, as, much, personal, attention, as, possible, –, each, 1-Day, $99, Film, School, class, is, limited, to, 12, students. , No, more. , Why, 12? , Why, not, 50? , 100? , Because,, again,, this, is, not, about, turning, a, profit, like, those, other, "online", or, "weekend", filmmaking, courses, –, it’s, about, turning, out, filmmakers. , And, in, a, manner, that, I, (and, you), will, feel, most, comfortable, in., Oh,, yeah…, one, more, thing…, I, present, all, of, the, information, in, plain, old, English. , No, fancy, terms, or, overly, technical, mumbo-jumbo. , And, I, do, it, in, a, funny,, upbeat, way. , You'll, laugh, as, you, learn..., and, that,, in, my, opinion,, is, the, best, way, to, gain, the, knowledge, you, desire., And, I, am, always, open, for, questions. , Always! , So,, be, prepared, to, ask, away,, baby,, because, that's, the, only, way, you’re, going, to, learn!,  ,       , What, Are, Bobby's, Students, Saying?,        , Where, Exactly, Are, The, Classes,

Doers, and, Talkers. , So,, now, is, the, time, to, ask, yourself, the, big, question:, "Do, you, really, want, to, make, your, feature, film?", If, the, answer, is, "no", then, I, wish, you, the, best, of, luck, in, whatever, other, endeavors, you, decide, upon. , However,, if, the, answer, is, "yes", –, then, what, can, you, possibly, lose, by, taking, the, 1-Day, $99, Film, School?, I, know, what, some, of, you, are, saying, –, "Hey!, I, can, lose, an, entire, Saturday, afternoon, and, $99, bucks!" , Fair, enough. , But,, let, me, counter, by, saying, this, –, you, could, also, lose, $50,000, and, 4, years, of, your, life, toiling, in, film, school. , Right?, And,, frankly,, doesn't, it, make, more, sense, to, spend, $99, on, my, course, –, and, then, spend, that, remaining, $49,900, on, your, movie? , ...DUH!, So,, which, would, you, rather, do? , Which, is, the, better, investment,, both, financially, and, time-wise?, Listen,, I’m, not, some, college, professor,

you, an, incredible, opportunity, to, learn,, in, ONE, DAY,, for, LESS, THAN, $100,, how, to, make, a, feature, film, for, as, little, money, as, possible..., and, then, sell, it. , Period., Now,
