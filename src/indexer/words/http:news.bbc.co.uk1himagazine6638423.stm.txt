Helvetica, at, 50, By, Finlo, Rohrer, BBC, News, Magazine, The, Helvetica, font, is, celebrating, its, 50th, birthday., You've, probably, seen, it, a, thousand, times, today., Why?, At, this, moment, in, boardrooms, across, the, globe,, captains, of, industry, are, leafing, through, sheet, after, sheet, of, typefaces., There, are, hundreds, of, choices,, but, many, of, these, movers, and, shakers, don't, take, a, lot, of, leafing, before, plumping, for, Helvetica., We, live, in, a, world, where, we, are, surrounded, 24, hours, a, day, by, adverts, and, corporate, communications,, many, in, typefaces, chosen, to, subliminally, complement, the, message., COMPARE, MAJOR, FONTS, Helvetica, and, its, rivals, Helvetica's, message, is, this:, you, are, going, to, get, to, your, destination, on, time;, your, plane, will, not, crash;, your, money, is, safe, in, our, vault;, we, will, not, break, the, package;, the, paperwork, has, been, filled, in;, everything, is, going, to, be, OK., It, is, sans, serif., There, are, no, wiggly, bits, at, the, end, of, the, letters., It, has, smooth,, clean, lines,, and, an, unobtrusive, geometry, that, almost, suggests, it, was, designed, not, to, stand, out., Lars, Mueller, is, a, Helvetica, devotee., He, has, published, a, book,, Helvetica:, Homage, to, a, Typeface,, and, recently, donated, an, original, set, of, lead, lettering, to, a, Helvetica, exhibition, at, the, Museum, of, Modern, Art, in, New, York., "It, has, a, modern, attitude, which, lines, up, with, the, aesthetic, premises, of, the, 1950s, and, 60s., Helvetica, is, a, corporate, typeface,, but, on, the, other, hand, it's, the, favourite, of, hairdressers, and, kebab, shops., It, is, the, butter, on, the, bread.", It, also, says, bland,, unadventurous,, unambitious, Neville, Brody,, designer, Gap,, Orange,, Currys,, Hoover,, Lufthansa,, Panasonic,, Royal, Bank, of, Scotland,, Tupperware,, Zanussi., The, list, of, brands, that, use, the, Swiss, typeface, -, celebrating, its, 50th, anniversary, this, year, -, would, fill, this, page., "It's, durable., It, comes, from, natural, design, forms., It, doesn't, have, an, expression, of, fashion., It, has, very, clear, lines, and, characters,, it, looks, like, a, very, serious, typeface,", says, Frank, Wildenberg,, managing, director, of, Linotype,, the, German, firm, that, owns, the, font., The, typeface,, inspired, by, the, 1896, font, Akzidenz, Grotesk,, was, designed, by, Max, Miedinger, in, 1957, in, conjunction, with, Eduard, Hoffmann, for, the, Haas, Type, Foundry,, in, Muenchenstein,, Switzerland., As, Wildenberg, notes,, its, Swissness, is, part, of, the, appeal., The, land, where, clocks, run, meticulously, and, the, streets, are, spotless, carries, the, kind, of, cultural, resonance, that, the, logo, makers, and, brand, masters, of, the, major, corporations, might, like, a, bit, of., For, others,, its, neutrality, is, a, platform, for, daring, design., The, typeface's, dominance, over, the, past, half-century,, cemented, by, the, release, of, Neue, Helvetica, in, the, 1980s,, has, now, inspired, a, documentary,, Helvetica,, and, exhibitions, on, both, sides, of, the, Atlantic., Bland, uniformity, But, not, everyone, is, a, Helvetica, lover., Type, "I, hate, Helvetica", into, Google, and, there, are, forums, for, people, who, rage, at, the, mindless, "corporate, chic", of, this, dominant, font., They, see, it, as, a, vehicle, for, social, conformity, through, consumerism,, shifting, product, with, a, great, big, steam-roller, of, neutrality., Clear, and, simple, Leading, graphic, designer, and, typographer, Neville, Brody,, who, sparked, a, spate, of, Helvetica, use, with, his, design, for, Arena, magazine, in, the, 80s,, says, the, typeface, represents, a, safe, choice, for, businesses., "When, people, choose, Helvetica, they, want, to, fit, in, and, look, normal., They, use, Helvetica, because, they, want, to, be, a, member, of, the, efficiency, club., They, want, to, be, a, member, of, modernism., They, want, to, be, a, member, of, no, personality., It, also, says, bland,, unadventurous,, unambitious., "Typefaces, control, the, message., Choice, of, font, dictates, what, you, think, about, something, before, you, even, read, the, first, word., Imagine, Shakespeare, in, large, capital, drop, shadow., Our, response, would, be, quite, different, towards, the, content.", It's, perhaps, understandable, that, corporations, don't, want, to, take, any, typographic, risks,, bound, as, they, are, by, the, bottom, line., Choose, a, wacky, typeface, in, your, logos, or, advertising,, and, turnover, may, suffer., Helvetica,, on, the, other, hand,, offers, clarity, and, neutrality., When, used, in, adverts,, it, is, a, platform, for, other, parts, of, the, message., Nadine, Chahine,, who, works, in, sales, and, marketing, for, Linotype,, advises, companies, on, what, font, to, use., "If, you, take, a, script, typeface, [with, a, handwriting-like, appearance], and, use, it, as, the, logo, for, a, bank,, there's, a, problem., You, need, something, reliable, -, it's, where, you, keep, your, money., It, is, not, about, a, fun,, personal, message., "It, uses, subliminal, messages, so, that, you, get, a, feeling., All, of, these, different, meanings, are, implied, within, typefaces.", Hence, the, font, Frutiger, is, used, for, airports, and, European, motorway, signs,, New, Johnston, is, the, choice, of, London, Underground,, Cooper, Black, for, Easyjet,, and, Dunkin, Donuts, bears, the, unmistakable, Frankfurter, font., Default, setting, But, away, from, the, boardroom,, many, ordinary, computer, users, follow, the, same, path, of, choosing, fonts, that, say, something, about, themselves, when, they, send, an, e-mail, or, write, a, letter, or, CV., You've, probably, endorsed, Helvetica, yourself, by, using, one, of, its, digital, clones,, the, Arial, typeface,, to, write, e-mails, -, perhaps, because, it's, easy, to, read,, because, it, looks, reassuring, familiar, or, because, it, may, be, the, default, font, on, your, system., Others, might, use, a, Courier, or, a, Times, New, Roman, to, impart, their, authority,, or, choose, the, cartoonish, Comic, Sans, to, go, with, their, Mickey, Mouse, tie., It, speaks, of, reliability, And, just, as, with, the, hegemonic, Helvetica,, these, choices, arouse, strong, feelings., There, is, a, "ban, Comic, Sans", campaign,, which, has, attempted, to, get, legislation, enacted, in, Canada., In, Germany,, the, battle, between, typefaces, ran, alongside, the, country's, turbulent, history, and, struggle, for, national, identity, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, Century., Black, letter, Gothic, typefaces, like, Fraktur, were, alternately, endorsed, and, then, banned, by, the, Nazis., Now,, despite, being, most, associated, outside, Germany, with, footballers', tattoos, and, covers, of, heavy, metal, albums,, there, is, still, a, group, dedicated, to, its, return, to, common, usage., Helvetica, may, be, the, most, dominant, of, the, fonts,, but, it, has, not, squashed, the, opposition, in, either, advertising, or, the, e-mail., And, whether, you, use, it,, or, choose, not, to,, you, are, sending, out, a, message., Here, is, a, selection, of, your, comments., Studies, of, reading, speed, and, comprehension, (Paterson, and, Tinker, 1940), strongly, suggest, that, all, 'normal', typefaces, are, equally, legible, and, that, differences, are, perceived, or, learned., But, try, writing, maths, in, a, sans, serif, font, and, see, what, happens, ..., Richard,, Bath, Gareth,, Beddoes,, I, use, Comic, Sans, on, my, CV, specifically, to, avoid, working, for, people, like, you, to, whom, presentation, means, more, than, content., Ben,, Phimai,, Thailand, Coolvetica, for, me, please,, helvetica's, know-it-all, sister, expanded, to, about, 150%, width., Serifs, have, gone, the, way, of, the, nehru, jacket., rb, korbet-wootton,, brighton, UK, I'm, sure, I, read, once, that, serif, fonts, are, supposed, to, be, easier, to, read, on, the, page, because, the, little, tails, and, strokes, help, guide, the, eye, from, letter, to, letter., That's, what, the, serifs, are, for, apparently., Seems, to, be, contrary, to, what, people, think, here, so, is, that, theory, total, bunkum?, Paul,, London, I, can, not, believe, that, I, am, joining, a, debate, on, fonts., However,, Beddoes, of, London, blaming, the, prolilfic, use, of, Comic, Sans, on, women?, Please!, As, a, woman,, I, am, offended, by, this., I, am, all, up, for, freedom, of, speech,, but, please, do, not, use, Comic, Sans, to, express, it., Sorry,, was, this, a, discussion, on, Helvetica?, Oh, yes,, sorry., Well,, it's, a, bit, 'new, gastro, pub', don't, you, think?, Laura,, London, Two, fonts, walk, into, the, bar,, and, the, barman, says,, "sorry, lads,, we, don't, serve, your, type"., JB,, Gerrards, Cross, Helvetica, is, a, very, large, type, family,, not, just, one, face., Proper, Helvetica, is, OK,, clean, and, simple, and, well, formed, -, but, the, digital, so, called, clone, Arial, is, horrid, as, are, all, such, faces, in, my, view,, they, lack, the, subtlety, and, elegance, of, the, originals., But, give, me, Gill, Sans, anyday,, designed, by, stone, cutter, Eric, Gill, as, a, tribute, to, Johnston's, competition, (to, design, it), winning, London, Underground, face., Both, are, based, on, straight, lines, and, circles., The, BBC, uses, Gill, and, it, always, looks, cool, to, me., The, digital, clones, don't, look, as, good, as, the, original, in, the, case, of, Gill, too., Like, I, say,, proper, Helvetica, is, OK., But, don't, get, me, started, on, Comic, Sans....., I, said, don't...., Ian, Kendrick,, Wirral,, UK, How, dare, Paris, Hilton, call, our, lives, mundane, when, we, can, talk, so, passionately, about, fonts!, Mark,, Chester, Typefaces, can, reflect, cultural, trends, too-, thinking-man's, musician, Max, Tundra, has, a, track, named, "The, Gradual, Disappearance, From, Food, Packaging, Of, The, Lettres, Ornées, Typeface, Since, The, Nineteen, Sixties"., Once, you, recognise, the, font, you'll, see, what, he, means!, Brother, Wetlands,, Bristol,, UK, Helvetica,, Like, Comic, sans,, is, a, font, that, is, easy, to, read, and, decipher, becuase, of, its, flowing,, even, curves, and, lack, of, serifs., They, are, ideal, fonts, for, children, learning, to, read, and, adults, with, reading/learning, difficulties., Surely, we, should, encourage, and, welcome, the, use, of, these, fonts, rather, than, ban, them, as, boring, and, unstylish., Simon, Hunt,, London, A, Helvetica, priest, was, trying, to, persuade, a, young, couple, to, have, their, new, baby, baptised., "Sorry", said, the, mother, "we, do, not, want, him, Christened, in, your, font."., tony,, Derby, UK, This, discussion, is, almost, as, important, as, whether, cucumber, sandwiches, should, be, cut, on, the, diagonal, or, the, square, Barry, P,, Havant, England, I'm, a, bit, of, fence-sitter, when, it, comes, to, the, relative, pros, and, cons, of, Helvetica, (I, guess, I, get, out, quite, a, bit),, but, I, do, find, it, odd, the, Microsoft, have, decided, to, exclude, it, from, Word, 2007., I'm, still, allowed, to, write, in, 'Wingdings', (why?),, 'Baby, Kruffy', (I'm, 31, years, old), and, Croobie, (What, a, hoot!), but, not, bog-standard, Helvetica., What's, with, that,, Bill?, Andy, Jackson,, London, It's, Verdana, for, me., It, has, Helvetica's, clean, lines,, but, with, a, modern, sleekness., I, like, to, think, of, it, as, Helvetica's, sexier, sister., And, yes,, I, really, should, get, out, more..., Michael, S,, Lancaster, I, am, visually-impaired, and, find, Arial, or, Verdana, easier, to, read, on, screen, but, Helvetica, is, easy, enough, to, read, for, print, -, Anything, with, fancy, or, with, serifs, makes, life, very, difficult., I, think, the, same, applies, to, people, with, literacy, difficulties, as, well, AJF,, C, Scotland, Much, more, important, than, the, 50th, anniversary, of, Helvetica,, it's, the, 50th, anniversary, of, Univers, ¿, the, thinking, man's, Helvetica., The, former, is, just, an, amalgam, of, designs, developing, through, the, 19th, century,, while, Univers, is, a, truly, groundbreaking, design, and, the, first, real, 'rational', type, system., Thing, is,, you, probably, see, Univers, every, day, too!, Clive, Bruton,, United, Kingdom, Think, of, the, time, those, monks, could, have, saved, if, they'd, used, Helvetica, for, their, hand-crafted, illuminated, letters!, Andy, Gallant,, Leicester, Being, an, American, graphic, artist,, I, prefer, Morris, Benton's, News, Gothic, over, Miedinger's, Helvetica,, which, is, perfectly, appropriate, for, contintental, Europe,, in, the, same, way, that, Gill's, Gill, Sans, belongs, to, the, UK., But, it, sure, is, impossible, to, deny, that, Helvetica, is, the, cream, that, has, risen, to, the, top., It, is, universal., It, says, us., Mike, Koppa,, Viroqua,, WI,, USA, Anyone, who, uses, 'Comic, Sans', (what', so, comic, about, it?), needs, to, be, taken, outside, and, shot!, -, espcially, in, serious, work-related, emails., Similarly,, those, using, Times, New, Roman, are, compelling, readers, to, squint, and, struggle, to, read, the, document., I, support, Helvetica, for, anything, that, requires, clarity, and, ease, of, reading., The, white, space, it, creates, on, a, page, is, also, easy, on, the, eye, (I, have, written, and, maintained, an, 380, page, NHS, Trust, formulary, for, years, and, have, listened, to, what, readers, prefer...), John,, Altrincham, UK, You're, only, really, creative, if, you, can, be, creative, with, Helvetica, -, This, type, face, is, perfect, -, It's, all, you, need., Rick,, London, I, went, through, a, period, when, I, was, big, into, typefaces,, and, would, go, to, the, St., Brides, printing, library, off, Fleet, Street., It's, nice, to, be, reminded, of, that, period,, and, a, dormant, interest., I, read, then, that, "there, is, no, such, thing, as, a, bad, typeface",, although, I, share, a, dislike, for, Comic, Sans!, Helvetica, is, clearly, an, excellent, typeface,, but, seems, to, be, getting, blamed, for, sentiments, aimed, at, the, organisations, using, it., It's, also, worth, noting, that, Serif, typefaces, are, designed, to, help, the, eye, read, a, large, body, of, text, (which, is, why, Time, New, Roman, was, used, by, The, Times, newspaper),, whilst, Sans, Serif, is, good, for, section, titles, etc., -, it, provides, a, useful, contrast, to, the, Serif, font., Turkeybellyboy,, Newcastle, upon, Tyne, While, it, is, important, to, chart, the, success, and, use, of, this, typeface, by, companies, such, as, Orange, and, Gap,, it, is, also, worth, mentioning, that, the, Helvetica, that, they, use, is, not, always, the, same, one, that, you, will, find, installed, by, default, on, your, home, computer., The, more, 'designed', version, of, Helvetica, bears, more, resemblance, with, the, original, Haas, Grotesque, and, is, generally, better, known, as, Helvetica, Neue,, or, even, it's, predecessor, Akzidenz, Grotesque., These, come, in, a, much, wider, array, of, weights, and, have, a, cleaner, look, than, the, standard, installer, fonts, you, get, for, free., Karl, Randay,, Lichfield, Beddoes,, you, have, nailed, it., Comic, Sans, has, to, be, the, most, inappropriately, used, font, on, the, globe., If, I, receive, an, official, memo, or, form, by, email, created, using, this, ghastly,, on, might, say, flippant, typeface,, I, immediately, have, to, change, it, all, into, a, more, sober, and, reflective, one, (such, as, our, good, friend, Helvetica, or, even, the, much, maligned, Courier, New, -, after, all,, we, used, typewriters, for, decades, with, no, ill, effects.), But,, yes,, Comic, Sans, -, fine, if, you're, doing, a, worksheet, for, kids,, but, in, the, adult, workplace?, On, a, C.V.?, On, an, information, panel, or, sign?, Nein, danke!, Gareth, Davies,, Manchester, Helvetica, is, a, marvellous, font., It, looks, clean, and, efficient,, the, epitome, of, good, modernist, design., Compare, that, with, the, fussy,, stuffy,, excessive, formality, of, Times, New, Roman., It's, the, sort, of, thing, Telegraph, readers, would, send, emails, in., If, they, weren't, still, using, typewriters., Patrick,, Leicester, Helvetica, is, a, solid,, plain, and, structured, font, that, is, incredibly, easy, to, read., That, is, part, of, what, makes, it, so, useful, for, logos., It, doesn't, overshadown, the, name, itself, or, the, logo/colours, that, accompany, it., I, prefer, fonts, that, are, a, little, more, decorative,, and, my, faviourite, is, Garamond,, which, is, more, interesting, than, Helvetica, and, more, round, than, Times, New, Roman,, so, it, seems, more, friendly, and, less, rigid, than, most, other, fonts., Heather,, Wolverhampton, Aaaaaggghhh, -, Helvetica!, I, hate, this, typeface,, are, people, really, that, lacking, in, creativity, that, they, have, to, slump, for, a, font, that, is, used, on, every, other, thing, that, you, see!, I, would, start, a, petition, against, it's, use, but, it, would, probably, be, printed, in, helvetica, or, it's, PC, based, twin, Arial..., Don't, start, me, on, Times, Roman...., Chris, Brown,, Thame, Oxfordshire, I, think, the, more, pressing, issue, here, is, to, drum, up, support, for, the, "Ban, Comic, Sans", campaign., I, hate, comic, sans,, it's, everywhere., I'm, looking, at, you, girls!, I, also, hate, small, business/pubs, advertising, local, events, using, "Word, Art", in, Microsoft, Word,, which, has, not, changed, since, 1997., Sort, it, out!, Beddoes,, London, The, MOD, have, many, policies, regarding, documents,, and, the, usage, of, fonts, is, included, in, that., Arial, (strikingly, similar, to, Helvetica), is, encouraged, to, be, used, to, ensure, the, legibility, and, clarity, of, a, document,, as, well, as, to, be, as, easy, as, possible, for, those, with, reading, difficulties, to, absorb., Clarity, over, the, zeitgeist, is, certainly, preferable....I'm, talking, to, you,, "trendy", website, designers!, KR,, Cheltenham,, UK, It, all, depends, on, use., Sans-serif, fonts, are, simply, ugly, when, seen, on, the, printed, page,, whilst, having, the, benefit, of, clarity, on, a, screen, (and, it, is, about, time, we, recognised, that, the, two, are, very, different, media,, working, together,, rather, the, replacing, each, other)., Fortunately, most, of, my, work, is, still, in, print,, so, I, can, continue, to, use, the, far, more, elegant, Old-Style, Latin, fonts, (complete, with, Old-Style, numbers,, which, most, generic, fonts, ignore,, spoiling, the, line, of, any, text)., Indeed, my, fiancee, has, just, decided, they, look, so, much, better, as, to, have, our, wedding, invitations, etc, printed, in, Old-Style., The, early, humanist, printers, (both, French, and, Italian), had, far, more, appreciation, of, the, book, as, a, thing,, as, well, as, a, mode, of, communication,, and, that, aesthetic, feel, is, lacking, in, the, modern, typefaces., Anon,, Cambridge, E-mail, this, to, a, friend, Printable, version, In, today's,
