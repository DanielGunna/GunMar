listings, that, need, attention., They, are, used, when, the, listed, site, appears, to, have, a, problem, (for, example,, an, error, condition),, or, when, the, title, or, description, of, the, listing, are, incorrect., Flags, were, introduced, in, 2014, as, a, replacement, for, the, "Update, Request", feature;, they, offer, a, better,, more, intuitive, editor, experience,, as, well, as, new, features, not, offered, by, the, old, system., Flags, come, in, three, primary, flavors:, Public, flags, (purples), are, closest, to, the, old, Update, Requests,, and, are, placed, via, the, public, directory, pages., Editor, guidance, flags, are, generally, placed, via, the, editor-side, URL, editing, form,, and, are, meant, primarily, for, metas, and, mentors, to, provide, feedback, about, specific, listings, to, less, experienced, editors., Autoflags, are, placed, using, automated, tools, and, scripts, used, by, technical, editors., They, point, at, possible, problems, with, listings, that, need, editor, attention, (humans, do, it, better)., The, three, types, of, flags, are, described, in, more, detail, below., The, final, section, gives, some, tips, on, dealing, with, flags, you, encounter, in, your, editing., Public, flags, These, are, commonly, referred, to, simply, as, "flags", –, they, are, the, direct, replacement, for, the, update, requests, that, the, public, could, submit, in, older, versions, of, DMOZ., To, place, a, flag,, click, on, the, icon, to, the, right, of, a, listing, on, the, public, directory, page., This, takes, you, to, the, "Report, an, Issue, With, a, Listing", form,, where, you, must, select, the, type, of, issue, with, the, listing, (for, example,, error, page,, wrong, category,, or, incorrect, title/description)., Depending, on, which, type, is, selected,, input, fields, for, further, explanation, are, added, to, the, form., While, public, flags, are, usually, placed, by, non-editors,, editors, can, place, flags, too., If, they, are, not, logged, in,, this, works, exactly, the, same, as, for, the, public,, requiring, an, email, and, a, CAPTCHA, entry., Logged-in, editors, see, a, slightly, different, version, of, the, form,, without, the, email, input, or, CAPTCHA., In, the, category, counts, in, the, editing, interface,, public, flags, are, shown, using, a, purple, font,, and, the, flag, block, on, the, URL, editing, page, has, a, purple, background., "Purples", propagate, all, the, way, up, the, tree,, so, you, can, find, a, public, flag, by, navigating, down, from, high, up, in, a, branch., Editor, guidance, flags, Mentors, and, metas, often, visit, categories, maintained, by, less, experienced, editors,, and, may, find, slight, problems, with, the, listings, there:, the, title, may, not, be, constructed, according, to, our, editing, guidelines,, the, description, may, need, help,, or, perhaps, the, listing, would, be, better, placed, in, a, different, subcategory., Before, the, advent, of, editor, guidance, flags,, depending, on, how, much, time, experienced, editors, had, available,, they, could, write, editor, feedback, to, the, category, editor, (which, can, be, time, consuming),, but, frequently, they, would, simply, unreview, the, listing,, leaving, their, feedback, in, an, editor, note., This, was, not, ideal,, since, it, left, a, site, that, deserved, a, listing, sitting, in, unreviewed, until, the, category, editor, found, and, relisted, it., Editor, guidance, flags, provide, a, new, way, to, give, feedback, about, a, specific, listing, to, the, editor, of, its, category,, without, affecting, the, public, view, of, the, listing., Editor, guidance, flags, can, be, placed, by, logged-in, editors, using, the, form, for, placing, a, public, flag,, by, selecting, the, "provide, guidance, to, category, editor", option., Most, conveniently,, editors, arrive, at, this, form, by, clicking, the, "add, flag", link, to, the, right, of, the, editor, note, input, box, on, the, URL, editing, form., Editor, guidance, flags, appear, with, a, pink, background, on, the, URL, editing, form., Because, they, are, meant, as, feedback, to, a, local, editor,, they, are, only, visible, within, the, direct, category, in, which, they, were, placed:, you, cannot, find, editor, guidance, flags, from, higher, up, in, the, branch., Autoflags, Autoflags, are, placed, by, automated, tools, run, by, technical, editors, focused, on, quality, control, activities., Quality, control, processes, identify, many, sites, with, problems, (e.g.,, error, pages),, and, unreview, the, listings, automatically, as, errors, ("reds")., However,, some, conditions, are, more, difficult, to, judge:, there, is, probably, a, problem, with, the, site, (for, example,, it, says, "This, site, is, under, construction"),, but, making, the, final, judgment, requires, a, human, editor., Autoflags,, introduced, in, 2015,, provide, a, way, for, these, quality, control, processes, to, draw, editors', attention, to, these, listings., They, will, typically, include, an, automatically, generated, message, explaining, the, condition, that, was, encountered,, as, well, as, the, name, of, the, editor, whose, automated, tool, placed, the, flag., In, the, category, counts, in, the, editing, interface,, autoflags, are, shown, using, an, orange, font,, and, the, flag, block, on, the, URL, editing, page, has, an, orange, background., Autoflags, propagate, all, the, way, up, the, tree,, so, you, can, find, them, by, navigating, down, from, high, up, in, a, branch., Tips, for, dealing, with, flags, in, the, editing, interface, When, you, navigate, to, the, edit, page, of, a, category, that, has, one, or, more, active, flags,, you'll, see, that, the, EDIT, buttons, for, listings, that, are, flagged, are, color-coded, according, to, the, type, of, flag, (purple, for, public,, pink, for, editor, guidance,, orange, for, autoflag)., Also,, to, provide, quick, access, to, the, flagged, listings,, there, is, a, line, of, "Quick, links, to, flagged, listings", just, above, the, listings., Click, any, of, these, edit, buttons, to, get, to, the, URL, edit, page, and, deal, with, the, flag., On, the, URL, edit, page,, flags, are, shown, below, any, URL, notes, and, above, the, main, editing, form., The, color, of, the, flag, block, indicates, the, type, of, flag., A, listing, may, have, more, than, one, flag,, of, the, same, or, different, types., The, flag, block, shows, the, type, of, flag, (in, the, case, of, public, flags,, the, sub-type, selected, by, the, submitter),, a, note, describing, the, problem,, and, details, about, the, submission, (date, and, time,, and, either, an, email, or, an, editor, name)., Public, flags, and, autoflags, may, also, show, a, URL, field,, which, specifies, a, suggested, new, or, alternative, URL, for, the, listing,, and, public, flags, may, show, a, title, and, description, field,, for, suggested, improvements, to, the, listing., Each, of, the, fields,, if, it, has, a, value,, has, an, associated, icon;, clicking, the, icon, transfers, the, contents, of, the, field, to, the, corresponding, field, on, the, editing, form., When, encountering, a, flag,, carefully, read, the, information, provided,, and, then, look, at, the, site, that, is, listed., If, you, agree, that, a, change, is, needed, to, the, listing,, make, the, changes, either, by, transferring, information, from, the, flag, block, to, the, form,, or, by, making, your, own, changes, directly, in, the, editing, form., In, some, cases,, the, best, action, will, be, to, unreview, or, even, delete, the, listing,, in, other, cases, the, URL,, title,, and/or, description, need, to, be, changed, according, to, the, editing, guidelines, and, the, editor's, judgment., If, you, enter, a, new, URL,, either, by, cutting/pasting, from, your, browser, or, by, transferring, its, value, from, the, flag, block,, the, "[new]", link, on, the, editing, form, will, open, the, new, URL, in, a, new, browser, window., You, may, also, want, to, check, if, this, new, URL, is, already, listed,, by, clicking, the, "check, listings", link, to, the, right, of, the, URL, input, field., When, you, delete, a, listing,, any, associated, flags, are, automatically, deleted., Any, other, editing, actions, do, not, have, any, effect, on, the, flag:, if, you, unreview, a, listing,, the, flag, will, be, attached, to, the, unreviewed, entry;, if, you, make, changes, to, the, listing,, the, flag, will, remain, attached, to, the, revised, listing., In, most, cases,, you, will, want, to, delete, the, flag, once, you, have, decided, what, the, appropriate, course, of, action, is., To, do, this,, click, the, "Dismiss", button, on, the, flag, block., It, is, easiest, to, do, this, before, taking, any, editing, action, using, the, edit-URL, form,, otherwise, you, may, forget, to, delete, the, flag,, and, have, to, deal, with, it, again, later., When, dismissing, a, flag,, please, take, a, few, seconds, to, select, the, best, entry, from, the, selections, at, the, bottom, of, the, flag, block., For, public, flags,, the, choices, are, "helpful":, you, used, some, of, the, information, provided, to, improve, the, listing, "useless":, for, example,, a, webmaster, trying, to, add, promotional, language, to, his, listing, "malicious":, for, example,, somebody, trying, to, get, a, listing, for, a, competitor, removed,, or, changed, to, a, listing, for, his, own, website., For, autoflags,, the, choices, are, "Condition, not, observed":, for, example,, the, autoflag, says, that, the, listing, redirects,, but, you, see, no, redirection, when, viewing, the, site, in, your, browser., "Condition, observed,, no, action, required":, for, example,, the, autoflag, notes, that, the, site, is, under, construction,, but, even, though, there, is, an, under-construction, notice, on, the, front, page,, there, is, still, a, lot, of, useful, information, on, the, site., "Condition, observed,, action, required":, the, flag, points, to, a, real, problem,, and, you, will, make, changes, to, the, listing, to, fix, the, problem, or, remove, the, listing, Making, a, selection, before, dismissing, the, flag, helps, keep, a, record, of, how, the, flag, was, processed., For, autoflags,, it, also, helps, technical, editors, improve, their, automated, tools., This, may, prevent, a, flag, from, being, applied, repeatedly, to, the, same, listing, for, an, issue, that, is, of, no, concern., You, may, provide, additional, free-form, feedback, about, your, action, (which, can, be, accessed, by, the, technical, editor), in, the, "Optional, note", input, field., Certain, editing, tools, make, it, easier, to, quickly, find, flags, that, need, attention., For, example,, Hunt, can, pinpoint, the, locations, of, flags, (as, well, as, errors, and, greenbusts), in, a, larger, branch,, avoiding, the, need, to, navigate, up, and, down, the, category, structure, to, track, them, all, down., Last, update:, Fri, Jul, 08, 10:59, EDT, 2016, Copyright, ©, 2016, AOL, Inc., (Terms, of, Use,
