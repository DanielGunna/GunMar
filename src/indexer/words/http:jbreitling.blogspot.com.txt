[., news,, reviews, and, opinion, since, 2001, |, online, at, clickyclickymusic.com, |, "you're, keeping, some, dark, secrets,, but, you, talk, in, your, sleep.", --, j.f., January, 16,, 2017, Clicky, Clicky's, Belated, Top, Albums, of, 2016, (Jay, Edition), So, yeah:, Hi!, It's, been, a, couple, months,, a, couple, very, busy, months, during, which, we, were,, frankly,, quite, uncertain, that, our, schedule, was, ever, going, to, permit, a, meaningful, return, to, the, blog., But, we, hate, not, closing, a, loop., And, while, we, continue, to, harbor, doubts, about, the, long-term, prospects, for, what, we've, been, internally, calling, "the, URL, version", of, Clicky, Clicky, (as, opposed, to, the, Facebook, version),, we, feel, it, would, be, unfair, to, not, give, our, favorite, records, of, 2016, their, due,, even, if, we, already, did, a, quick, list, for, Facebook., So, leaving, our, wavering, commitment, to, populating, the, URL, with, well-considered, words, aside,, let's, round, up, the, best, the, year-gone-by, had, to, offer., A, quick, glance, down, the, list, reveals, some, of, the, usual, suspects, --, the, great, KoomDogg, himself, chides, us, about, our, predilection, for, placing, the, mighty, Johnny, Foreigner, at, number, one, each, year, they, do, a, full-length,, and, any, Lubec, release, tends, to, rate, high, --, but, also, some, new, names., This, is, as, it, should, be., Were, it, not, for, those, new, names, we'd, grow, pretty, disinterested, in, following, music, as, closely, as, we, do., How, many, articles, and, books, can, one, read, about, The, Doors,, Pink, Floyd,, even, The, Clash,, after, all?, We, suppose, the, answer, to, that, question, is, however, many, we've, already, read,, but, more, germane, to, the, point, is, how, exhilarating, we, found, the, music, of, the, new, and, new-to-us, respectively, Strange, Passage, and, Real, Numbers,, for, example,, this, year., Legends,, veterans,, and, relative, veterans, such, as, David, Bowie,, Lambchop, and, Hallelujah, The, Hills, all, more, than, acquitted, themselves, with, releases, that, are, still, --, STILL, --, in, heavy, rotation, at, CCHQ, (well,, perhaps, less, so, now, that, The, XX's, new, joint, is, out)., Before, we, leave, you, to, digest, our, thoughts, on, our, 10, favorites, below,, we'd, like, to, note, that, it, was, trying, year, and, one, in, which, we, valued, music, more, than, ever., Our, need, for, peace, and, relaxation, in, the, face, of, substantial, work, stress, made, things, like, Spotify's, Steve, Reich, radio, station,, or, custom, stations, based, on, Erik, Satie's, Gymnop√©dies, or, the, Lilys, oeuvre,, reliable,, comforting, ways, to, experience, music., The, bigger, message,, we, suppose,, and, one, that, we'd, like, all, readers, to, take, to, heart, as, we, work, through, the, new, American, Political, Reality,, is, that, music, is, there, for, us., It, is, always, there., Cherish, it,, and, it, will, be, everything, you, need, it, to, be., Now, we'll, shut, up., Here's, the, best, shit, from, last, year., If, you, want, even, more, detail,, we, first, revealed, our, 2016, year-end, album, picks, during, a, December, taping, of, the, podcast, tour, de, force, Completely, Conspicuous,, and, the, three, links, below, will, take, you, to, the, three, episodes, featuring, my,

Foreigner, --, Mono, No, Aware, --, Alcopop!/Lame-O, There, is, an, astonishing, amount, of, detail, packed, into, its, briskly, paced, 35, minutes,, yet, Mono, No, Aware, succeeds, in, every, direction., There, are, the, blitzkrieging, singles, and, should-be, singles, that, are, Johnny, Foreigner's, stock-in-trade,, such, as, the, brilliant, rager, "If, You, Can't, Be, Honest,, Be, Awesome", and, fiery, "The, X, and, the, O,", respectively., Other, successes, are, perhaps, more, subtle, but, substantially, more, exciting., Even, 10, years, on, the, band, continues, to, best, itself, in, terms, of, songcraft,, adding, progressive, flair, to, a, genre, which, --, let's, be, honest, --, too, often, gets, to, coast, on, the, right, chords,, the, correct, pedals., The, brightly, burning, centerpiece, of, the, record, is, the, wild,, vivid, and, deconstructed, anthem, "Our, Lifestyles, Incandescent,", whose, verses, feature, thrilling, vocal, arrangements, structured, around, the, voice, of, Chicago, polymath, Nnamdi, Ogbonnaya., [full, review]., <a, href="http://alcopop.bandcamp.com/album/mono-no-aware">Mono, No, Aware, by, johnny, foreigner</a>, 02.,

instant, classics, touting, big, melodies,, scritchy, guitars, and, maximum, pep., Opener, "Frank, Infatuation", is, timeless,, and, makes, for, an, auspicious, start, to, this, high-quality, release., The, tune, is, all, fuzzy, strums,, plunky, bass,, and, surfy, leads,, delivered, at, a, carefree,, upbeat, tempo,, and,, sure,, there's, a, formula, at, work,, but, when, the, formula, is, this, fun, and, well-executed,, no, ones, cares., If, you, dig, "Frank, Infatuation", --, and, it, is, undeniable, --, make, sure, to, check, out, this, earlier, version, Real, Numbers, released, as, a, digital, single, in, 2014., Wordless, Wonder's, barn-storming, "Just, So, Far, Away", is, even, more, potent,, hitting, hard, with, a, chorus, first, before, blitzkrieging, through, short, verses, and, right, back, to, the, chorus, again., The, album, truly, is, all, killer, and, no, filler., [Hotness, blurb], <a, href="http://real-numbers.bandcamp.com/album/wordless-wonder">Wordless, Wonder,

the, short, set's, four, songs, echo, The, House, of, Love, and, the, early, RIDE, EPs,, and, --, more, contemporaneously, --, are, startlingly, reminiscent, of, the, massively, underrated, and, short-lived, aughts, combo, The, Boyfriends., While, there, is, a, thread, of, shoegaze, shot, through, Strange, Passage's, alluring, brand, of, guitar, pop,, and, Boston, continues, to, have, a, strong, share, of, contemporary, 'gaze, practitioners,, Strange, Passage's, music, still, feels, somewhat, delightfully, off-trend., [Hotness, blurb], <a,

Pleasures., The, set, includes, nine, new, tracks;, based, on, two, fetching, preview, tunes,, the, group, remains, faithful, to, its, favored, motorik, rhythms, and, wistful, bummer-pop., Leading, preview, single, "A, Change, of, Course", is, strikingly, more, dense, and, melodic, than, what, we've, come, to, expect, from, the, band;, it, takes, the, two-chord, pull, formula, of, earlier, tunes, such, as, "Sherry, Island", and, compacts, it, to, fit, a, sub-three-minute, pop, framework, that, echoes, the, more, shoegazey, side, of, early, Deerhunter., It, may, very, well, be, the, best, thing, the, Brighton, combo, has, released, (to, date)., Second, single, "Fugue, States", stretches, into, a, longer, runtime,, and, employs, open,, ringing, chords, alongside, a, rambling,, Ian, Curtis-styled, deadpan, that, reminds, listeners, that, Cold, Pumas, know, their, classic, gloomy, post-punk, inside, and, out., [Hotness, blurb], <a,

day, two, reportage, from, Boston, indie, pop, sextet, A√ºva's, foray, into, Mad, Oak, Studio., The, band, was, there, Friday,, Saturday, and, Sunday, this, past, weekend, with, producer, extraordinaire, Benny, Grotto, on, the, dime, of, an, anonymous, donor, and, friend, of, Clicky, Clicky,, and, the, plan, is, to, track, and, mix, three, new, songs., Yesterday, we, posted, singer, and, keyboardist, Miette, Hope's, impressions, of, the, first, day,, but, tangentially, we'll, note, that, A√ºva's, Friday, didn't, stop, when, that, session, was, over., The, band, played, a, show, at, Make, Out, Point, Friday,, Clicky, Clicky, operatives, were, there,, and, we're, told, A√ºva, played, one, new, song,, and, a, bunch, from, this, year's, LP, including, "Better", (whose, video, was, also, shot, in, part, at, the, Point), and, closing, the, set, with, the, dreamy, pop, gem, "Into, Place.", Mixing, on, the, three, new, tunes, is, slated, to, transpire, later, this, month., For, now,, check, out, drummer, Michael, Piccoli's, thoughts, on, the, second, day, of, the, sessions., Day, 2, in, the, studio, was, devoted, to, tracking, guitar,, keys, and, bass., We, arrived, at, noon, and, started, out, by, listening, to, all, the, drum, takes, from, day, one, with, fresh, ears, before, recording, other, instruments., We, were, all, glad, to, hear, that, the, drum, takes, were, solid, so, we, were, ready, to, move, on., Andy, did, a, great, job, nailing, down, the, bass, parts,, and, it, only, took, about, an, hour, for, him, to, play, all, three, songs., Benny, had, different, ideas, for, each, song, and, sent, the, bass, through, different, combinations, of, amplifiers, and, compressors, depending, on, what, he, thought, the, song, needed., After, recording, bass, we, moved, onto, rhythm, guitar, which, we, used, a, similar, approach, for., Benny, had, a, few, different, Reverend, guitars, in, the, studio, that, he, let, us, play, on, the, different, songs, in, order, to, achieve, the, best, sound, for, each, tune., He, also, had, some, ideas, for, what, Jake, was, playing, and, we, got, to, use, one, of, his, 12-strings, to, double, one, of, the, lead, lines, and, it, gave, the, sound, a, very, vintage, mid-'60s, sound,, reminiscent, of, The, Byrds,, which, we, were, all, excited, about., Moving, onto, keys,, we, used, our, Yamaha, MX49, keyboard, and, created, sounds, by, blending, two, different, instruments, and, adjusting, the, sound, envelope., We, also, tracked, acoustic, piano, on, a, couple, of, the, songs, and, used, two, mics, behind, the, piano, and, one, room, mic., Overall, it, was, a, great, day, in, the, studio, and, tomorrow, we, plan, to, move, onto, vocals,, lead, guitar,, and, percussion., --, Michael,

it's, time, for, an, update., The, young, and, talented, Boston, indie, pop, sextet, entered, the, hallowed, halls, of, Mad, Oak, Studios, with, esteemed, producer, Benny, Grotto, Friday, to, record, new, music,, and, we've, got, a, report, from, singer, and, keyboard, player, Miette., It, turns, out, the, band, and, the, studio, are, neighbors,, so, A√ºva, was, able, to, literally, just, push, its, gear, down, the, street, to, make, the, session,, which, seems, like, something, The, Monkees, would, have, done,, so, we, like, it., Anyway,, we'll, have, additional, notes, from, the, band, in, the, coming, days., For, now,, read, Miette's, take, on, day, one., Our, first, day, in, the, studio,, we, pushed, all, of, our, gear, over, in, a, shopping, cart, from, our, house, which, is, actually, right, down, the, road., Making, our, way, to, the, studio, we, were, surprised, at, how, well, it, was, disguised, in, what, looked, like, a, garage, from, the, front, right, around, the, corner, from, the, tattoo, shop, and, venues, we, have, all, been, to, before., When, we, met, Benny, he, was, super, nice, and, made, us, feel, very, comfortable, right, off, the, bat., His, conversation, was, casual, but, professional, and, we, didn't, waste, any, time, in, getting, right, down, to, business, discussing, our, instrumentation, and, process., The, studio, itself, was, amazing,, with, gorgeously, warm, toned, wood, floors, and, panels, surrounding., The, monitors, and, mixing, board, were, super, nice, and, there, were, so, many, different, compressors, and, preamp, options, throughout, the, mixing, room., We, all, took, a, seat, on, a, black, leather, couch, at, the, back, of, the, room, that, was, placed, perfectly, in, front, of, the, monitors, and, talked, about, our, recording, plans, for, the, day., After, some, conversation, we, collectively, decided, that, it, would, be, best, to, play, through, all, three, of, our, songs, live, and, focus, on, getting, the, best, drum, takes., We, sang, the, vocals, in, the, mixing, room, in, front, of, the, window, in, between, the, live, room, and, mixing, room, so, we, could, see, the, rest, of, the, band, and, they, could, see, us., Benny, is, also, a, drummer, so, he, had, some, cool, suggestions, for, Michael, in, order, to, get, the, best, possible, drum, sound., We, played, one, of, the, songs, without, a, click, to, really, get, the, feeling, of, the, way, we, are, used, to, playing, it, and, it, ended, up, going, really, well., Another, really, cool, thing, about, this, studio, is, that, the, lights, in, the, mixing, room, had, color, changing, capabilities, so, we, were, able, to, have, the, room, be, whatever, color, we, wanted, which, really, helped, us, get, into, the, feeling, of, the, music, a, little, more., Overall,, the, first, day, was, very, productive, and, we, had, such, a, good, time, working, with, Benny, and, in, that, space., Can't, wait, for, tomorrow,

bill, for, this, year's, Together, fest,, wrote, about, its, video, clip, earlier, in, July,, and, have, enjoyed, listening, to, its, 2016, self-titled, LP., And, so,, when, an, old, friend, from, the, Boston, music, scene, in, April, presented, us, with, a, very, intriguing, opportunity,, we, were, compelled, to, think, of, A√ºva, yet, one, more, time., Said, (very, kind), friend, provided, us, with, a, substantial, chunk, of, studio, time, in, one, of, the, city's, top, studios, --, and, with, a, Boston, Music, Award-winning, engineer, nominated, yet, again, this, year, --, for, us, to, give, away, (just, give, away,, just, like, that,, like, it, was, a, beer, or, an, extra, crew, neck, sweater), to, a, deserving, band., There, were, a, couple, caveats, we, were, happy, to, countenance,, the, upshot, of, which, was, we, needed, to, identify, a, young,, able, band, that, had, never, recorded, in, a, proper, studio, before., As, A√ºva's, prior, EPs, and, aforementioned, LP, were, self-recorded,, they, hit, Clicky, Clicky's, short, list, quickly,, and, were, the, last, act, standing, after, the, Clicky, Clicky, Brain, Trust's, deliberations, were, complete, in, mid-summer., So,, here's, what's, going, to, happen:, next, month,, A√ºva, will, enter, the, recently, re-everythinged, Mad, Oak, Studios, in, Allston, Rock, City, for, five, days, to, record, new,

be, exciting, to, find, out., After, a, successful, summer, tour, including, a, date, playing, adjacent, to, Brian, Wilson, in, New, Hampshire,, A√ºva, has, been, primarily, woodshedding,, but, area, fans, can, catch, them, performing, live, Nov., 11, at, Make, Out, Point;, the, bill, also, includes, Amherst,, Mass.', Calico, Blue., Those, unfamiliar, with, the, venue, would, do, well, to,

latest, and, third, record,, White, Laces, ventures, further, into, an, aesthetic, marked, by, dramatic, electronics, and, vast, reverbs, that, at, times, eschews, live, instrumentation, almost, entirely., The, stark, contrast, between, the, guitar-centered, and, relatively, angular, sound, of, White, Laces', early, years, and, the, boundless, atmospheres, it, has, conjured, for, itself, more, recently, is, no, more, apparent, than, when, contrasting, a, recently, released, compilation, of, remastered, early, track,, Sick, Of, Summer,, with, No, Floor., No, Floor, is, announced, by, the, swirling, faux, strings, and, bashing, electro, beat, of, "Youth, Vote,", with, fronter, Landis, Wine, dropping, the, en, medias, res, line, "I, figured, I'd, take, a, ride", as, a, invocation., Album, preview, tracks, "Dots", and, "Cheese", follow, with, increasingly, greater, electronic, flourishes, that, deepen, the, divide, between, the, White, Laces, of, today, and, the, more, conventional, approach, of, the, band's, early, years., Indeed,, as, the, chiming, opening, of, "Cheese", --, whose, melody, echoes, faintly, the, verse, of, P.I.L.'s, "Rise", --, transitions, to, its, own, serene, verse,, it, is, difficult, to, identify, any, non-electronic, sounds., Even, so,, the, music, never, feels, synthetic,, in, large, part, because, Mr., Wine's, soulful, vocals, on, No, Floor, are, the, most, emotionally, direct, of, the, band's, entire, oeuvre., In, a, departure, from, prior, practice,, No, Floor, was, recorded, primarily, at, home,, with, additional, vocal, tracking, at, a, studio, in, Richmond,, and, it, was, mixed, by, Philadelphia, hitmaker, Jeff, Zeigler, (Mr., Zeigler, had, previously, tracked, White, Laces, 2014, sophomore, set, Trance,, which, we,

decade., The, jangle, commandos', new, C86-indebted, collection,, Wordless, Wonder,, is, thronged, with, instant, classics, touting, big, melodies,, scritchy, guitars, and, maximum, pep., Opener, "Frank, Infatuation", is, timeless,, and, makes, for, an, auspicious, start, to, this, high-quality, release., The, tune, is, all, fuzzy, strums,, plunky, bass,, and, surfy, leads,, delivered, at, a, carefree,, upbeat, tempo,, and,, sure,, there's, a, formula, at, work,, but, when, the, formula, is, this, fun, and, well-executed,, no, ones, cares., If, you, dig, "Frank, Infatuation", --, and, it, is, undeniable, --, make, sure, to, check, out, this, earlier, version, Real, Numbers, released, as, a, digital, single, in, 2014., Wordless, Wonder's, barn-storming, "Just, So, Far, Away", is, even, more, potent,, hitting, hard, with, a, chorus, first, before, blitzkrieging, through, short, verses, and, right, back, to, the, chorus, again., The, album, truly, is, all, killer, and, no, filler,,

keys, and, dense, shoegazey, guitars, on, Psychopomp,, Michelle, Zauner's, full-length, debut, with, her, latest, project, Japanese, Breakfast,, represented, a, sharp, stylistic, pivot, away, from, the, music, of, her, beloved, and, much-Clicky, Clicky'd, Philly, indie, combo, Little, Big, League., That, and, the, fact, that, Psychopomp, was, largely, inspired, by, the, loss, of, Ms., Zauner's, mother, to, cancer, provided, ready-made, narratives, ahead, of, the, long-player's, release., But, the, big, story, for, Psychopomp,, which, was, issued, last, spring,, has, to, be, its, superlative, songwriting,, which, couches, concise, hooks, and, earworm, choruses, within, expansive, production., It, is, one, of, the, year's, more, arresting, releases., Last, Wednesday, night, at, Cambridge,, Mass.'s, Sinclair, the, band, ran, through, a, tight, live, reworking, of, the, record,, while, mixing, in, a, number, of, affirmative, nods, to, certain, key, influences., Among, the, live, set's, highlights, were, performances, of, widely, heralded, album, preview, tracks., Japanese, Breakfast's, cover, of, Birthday, Girls', "Everybody, Wants, To, Love, You,", whose, sprightly, indie, pop, guitar, leads, --, admittedly, something, of, a, tonal, outlier, on, record, --, practically, blossomed, in, a, live, setting., Better, still, was, the, band's, sparkling, rendition, of, "In, Heaven,", a, track, that, doubles, as, Psychopomp's, thesis, statement,, and, one, that, felt, particularly, cathartic, presented, on, stage., Multi-instrumentalist, Nick, Hawley-Garner, flipped, between, guitar, and, keys, throughout, the, set,, working, to, animate, Psychopomp's, lush, and, at, times, Smashing, Pumpkins-indebted, arrangements., Even, so,, and, aside, from, a, gorgeous, cover, of, The, Cranberries', eternal, teen-pop, smash, "Dreams,", the, night's, biggest, moment, was, Japanese, Breakfast's, set-closer,, an, as, yet-untitled, new, tune, touting, bubbly, synth, and, auto-tune, styled, vocals, from, Zauner., For, this,, she, abandoned, her, guitar, and, bounced, around, the, stage,, underscoring, this, reviewer's, hunch, that, the, band, may, be, heading, in, a, poppier,, and, perhaps, thrillingly, experimental,, direction., Following, its, show, at, The, Sinclair,, Japanese, Breakfast, played, two, sold-out, "hometown", shows, in, Brooklyn, and, Philadelphia;, next, week, the, act, heads, across, the, ocean, for, a, three-week, tour, of, the, UK, and, Western, Europe., Stream, all, of, Psychopomp, via, the, Bandcamp, embed, below, and, click,

swaying, Domino, Records, debut, Pool., Bandleader, Aaron, Maine, has, grabbed, headlines, for, taking, his, project, in, a, bolder, direction, away, from, its, earlier, downer, folk-rock., He, now, leads, a, much, looser, live, outfit,, and, has, become, something, of, an, enigmatic, focal, point:, video, clips, now, depict, his, slightly, off-kilter, delivery, and, dance, moves., There, are,

Occurrence., The, new, set,, The, Past, Will, Live, Forever,, marks, a, return, to, the, dark,, dramatic, and, brooding, material, of, the, Occurrence, oeuvre, of, what, we, can, now, call, the, B.W.S.F., [that, is,, before, Wayne, S., Feldman], era., Indeed,, while, the, 2013, LP, Decks, (which, we, premiered, here), and, an, attendant, EP, created, primarily, in, partnership, with, Mr., Feldman, were, notably, bouyant, and, relatively, bright,, with, his, dysphoric, new, collection, Mr., Urban, --, along, with, another, former, schoolmate,, current, collaborator, Cat, Hollyer, --, has, seemingly, retrenched,, embracing, once, more, the, tension, and, psychodrama, of, earlier, Occurrence, collections., Longtime, readers, likely, recall, being, first, introduced, to, Occurrence, via, the, act's, appearance, on, our, Ride, tribute, compilation,, Nofuckingwhere,, for, which, Mr., Urban, crafted, an, anxious, and, stinging, re-imagining, of, Nowhere's, title, cut., The, Past, Will, Last, Forever, is, at, its, most, agile, on, the, early, preview, track, "My, Days, And, Nights, Belong, To, You,", which, strings, together, sharp, rhythm, patterns, and, pairs, them, with, bleeping, and, ambient, synth, backing,, while, Ms., Hollyer, eerily, harmonizes, with, herself, via, multitracked, vocals., But, as, with, much, of, Urban's, work, (which, includes, scads, of, very, well, received, plays),, the, greatest, excitement, comes, from, odd, and, surreal, moments, and, sensibilities., "A, Bruised, Ivy, Grad", opens, with, quavering,, almost, unhinged, vocals, in, verses, built, over, a, hard, beat;, sampled, voices, occasionally, intercede,, a, crumbling, sound, momentarily, intrudes,, but, the, wobbly, falsetto, always, returns., Album, highlight, "Ghost, Free, Home", feints, with, the, feigned, ease, of, vibrato, cowboy, guitar, leads,, but, harsh,, monolithic, verses, serially, interject, before, a, remarkable, ambient, passage, takes, root, in, the, middle, of, the, song, and, spreads, out, in, every, direction, and, consumes, the, balance, of, its, six, minutes., Urban,, Hollyer, and, collaborator, Johnny, Hager, perform, cuts, from, The, Past, Will, Last, Forever, tomorrow, night, at, Rockwood, Music, Hall, in, Manhattan,, an, event, that, marks, six-year-old, Occurrence's, very, first, live, performance., It's, a, 7PM, show,, and, to, the, best, of, our, knowledge, tickets, remain, available,, so, why, not, make, a, night, of, it?, The, Past, Will, Last, Forever, is, available, now, as, a, digital, download, and, in, a, very, limited,
