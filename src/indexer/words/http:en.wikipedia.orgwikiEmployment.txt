be, a, corporation,, for, profit,, not-for-profit, organization,, co-operative, or, other, entity, is, the, employer, and, the, other, is, the, employee.[1], Employees, work, in, return, for, payment,, which, may, be, in, the, form, of, an, hourly, wage,, by, piecework, or, an, annual, salary,, depending, on, the, type, of, work, an, employee, does, or, which, sector, she, or, he, is, working, in., Employees, in, some, fields, or, sectors, may, receive, gratuities,, bonus, payment, or, stock, options., In, some, types, of, employment,, employees, may, receive, benefits, in, addition, to, payment., Benefits, can, include, health, insurance,, housing,, disability, insurance, or, use, of, a, gym., Employment, is, typically, governed, by, employment, laws, or, regulations,

to, an, endeavor, of, an, employer, or, of, a, person, conducting, a, business, or, undertaking, (PCBU)[2], and, is, usually, hired, to, perform, specific, duties, which, are, packaged, into, a, job., In, a, corporate, context,, an, employee, is, a, person, who, is, hired, to, provide, services, to, a, company, on, a, regular, basis, in, exchange, for, compensation, and, who, does, not, provide, these, services, as, part, of, an, independent, business.[3], Employer–worker, relationship[edit], Employer, and, managerial, control, within, an, organization, rests, at, many, levels, and, has, important, implications, for, staff, and, productivity, alike,, with, control, forming, the, fundamental, link, between, desired, outcomes, and, actual, processes., Employers, must, balance, interests, such, as, decreasing, wage, constraints, with, a, maximization, of, labor, productivity, in, order, to, achieve, a, profitable, and, productive, employment, relationship., Finding, employees, or, employment[edit], The, main, ways, for, employers, to, find, workers, and, for, people, to, find, employers, are, via, jobs, listings, in, newspapers, (via, classified, advertising), and, online,, also, called, job, boards., Employers, and, job, seekers, also, often, find, each, other, via, professional, recruitment, consultants, which, receive, a, commission, from, the, employer, to, find,, screen, and, select, suitable, candidates., However,, a, study, has, shown, that, such, consultants, may, not, be, reliable, when, they, fail, to, use, established, principles, in, selecting, employees.[1], A, more, traditional, approach, is, with, a, "Help, Wanted", sign, in, the, establishment, (usually, hung, on, a, window, or, door[4], or, placed, on, a, store, counter).[3], Evaluating, different, employees, can, be, quite, laborious, but, setting, up, different, techniques, to, analyze, their, skill, to, measure, their, talents, within, the, field, can, be, best, through, assessments.[5], Employer, and, potential, employee, commonly, take, the, additional, step, of, getting, to, know, each, other, through, the, process, of, job, interview., Training, and, development[edit], Training, and, development, refers, to, the, employer's, effort, to, equip, a, newly, hired, employee, with, necessary, skills, to, perform, at, the, job,, and, to, help, the, employee, grow, within, the, organization., An, appropriate, level, of, training, and, development, helps, to, improve, employee's, job, satisfaction.[6], Remuneration[edit], There, are, many, ways, that, employees, are, paid,, including, by, hourly, wages,, by, piecework,, by, yearly, salary,, or, by, gratuities, (with, the, latter, often, being, combined, with, another, form, of, payment)., In, sales, jobs, and, real, estate, positions,, the, employee, may, be, paid, a, commission,, a, percentage, of, the, value, of, the, goods, or, services, that, they, have, sold., In, some, fields, and, professions, (e.g.,, executive, jobs),, employees, may, be, eligible, for, a, bonus, if, they, meet, certain, targets., Some, executives, and, employees, may, be, paid, in, stocks, or, stock, options,, a, compensation, approach, that, has, the, added, benefit,, from, the, company's, point, of, view,, of, helping, to, align, the, interests, of, the, compensated, individual, with, the, performance, of, the, company., Employee, benefits[edit], Employee, benefits, are, various, non-wage, compensation, provided, to, employee, in, addition, to, their, wages, or, salaries., The, benefits, can, include:, housing, (employer-provided, or, employer-paid),, group, insurance, (health,, dental,, life, etc.),, disability, income, protection,, retirement, benefits,, daycare,, tuition, reimbursement,, sick, leave,, vacation, (paid, and, non-paid),, social, security,, profit, sharing,, funding, of, education,, and, other, specialized, benefits., In, some, cases,, such, as, with, workers, employed, in, remote, or, isolated, regions,, the, benefits, may, include, meals., Employee, benefits, can, improve, the, relationship, between, employee, and, employer, and, lowers, staff, turnover.[7], Organizational, justice[edit], Organizational, justice, is, an, employee's, perception, and, judgement, of, employer's, treatment, in, the, context, of, fairness, or, justice., The, resulting, actions, to, influence, the, employee-employer, relationship, is, also, a, part, of, organizational, justice.[7], Workforce, organizing[edit], Employees, can, organize, into, trade, or, labor, unions,, which, represent, the, work, force, to, collectively, bargain, with, the, management, of, organizations, about, working,, and, contractual, conditions, and, services.[8], Ending, employment[edit], Usually,, either, an, employee, or, employer, may, end, the, relationship, at, any, time,, often, subject, to, a, certain, notice, period., This, is, referred, to, as, at-will, employment., The, contract, between, the, two, parties, specifies, the, responsibilities, of, each, when, ending, the, relationship, and, may, include, requirements, such, as, notice, periods,, severance, pay,, and, security, measures.[8], In, some, professions,, notably, teaching,, civil, servants,, university, professors,, and, some, orchestra, jobs,, some, employees, may, have, tenure,, which, means, that, they, cannot, be, dismissed, at, will., Another, type, of, termination, is, a, layoff., Wage, labor[edit], Main, article:, Wage, labor, Worker, assembling, rebar, for, a, water, treatment, plant, in, Mazatlan,, Sinaloa,, Mexico., Wage, labor, is, the, socioeconomic, relationship, between, a, worker, and, an, employer,, where, the, worker, sells, their, labor, under, a, formal, or, informal, employment, contract., These, transactions, usually, occur, in, a, labor, market, where, wages, are, market, determined.[6][7], In, exchange, for, the, wages, paid,, the, work, product, generally, becomes, the, undifferentiated, property, of, the, employer,, except, for, special, cases, such, as, the, vesting, of, intellectual, property, patents, in, the, United, States, where, patent, rights, are, usually, vested, in, the, original, personal, inventor., A, wage, laborer, is, a, person, whose, primary, means, of, income, is, from, the, selling, of, his, or, her, labor, in, this, way.[8], In, modern, mixed, economies, such, as, that, of, the, OECD, countries,, it, is, currently, the, dominant, form, of, work, arrangement., Although, most, work, occurs, following, this, structure,, the, wage, work, arrangements, of, CEOs,, professional, employees,, and, professional, contract, workers, are, sometimes, conflated, with, class, assignments,, so, that, "wage, labor", is, considered, to, apply, only, to, unskilled,, semi-skilled, or, manual, labor.[9], Wage, slavery[edit], Main, article:, Labour, economics, Wage, labor,, as, institutionalized, under, today's, market, economic, systems,, has, been, criticized,[8], especially, by, both, mainstream, socialists, and, anarcho-syndicalists,[9][10][11][12], using, the, pejorative, term, wage, slavery.[13][14], Socialists, draw, parallels, between, the, trade, of, labor, as, a, commodity, and, slavery., Cicero, is, also, known, to, have, suggested, such, parallels.[15], The, American, philosopher, John, Dewey, posited, that, until, "industrial, feudalism", is, replaced, by, "industrial, democracy",, politics, will, be, "the, shadow, cast, on, society, by, big, business".[16], Thomas, Ferguson, has, postulated, in, his, investment, theory, of, party, competition, that, the, undemocratic, nature, of, economic, institutions, under, capitalism, causes, elections, to, become, occasions, when, blocs, of, investors, coalesce, and, compete, to, control, the, state.[17], Employment, contract[edit], Main, article:, Employment, contract, Australia[edit], Australian, employment, has, been, governed, by, the, Fair, Work, Act, since, 2009.[18], Bangladesh[edit], Bangladesh, Association, of, International, Recruiting, Agencies, (BAIRA), is, an, association, of, national, level, with, its, international, reputation, of, co-operation, and, welfare, of, the, migrant, workforce, as, well, as, its, approximately, 1200, members, agencies, in, collaboration, with, and, support, from, the, Government, of, Bangladesh.[9], Canada[edit], In, the, Canadian, province, of, Ontario,, formal, complaints, can, be, brought, to, the, Ministry, of, Labour., In, the, province, of, Quebec,, grievances, can, be, filed, with, the, Commission, des, normes, du, travail.[12], Pakistan[edit], Pakistan, has, Contract, Labor,, Minimum, Wage, and, Provident, Funds, Acts., Contract, labor, in, Pakistan, must, be, paid, minimum, wage, and, certain, facilities, are, to, be, provided, to, labor., However,, the, Acts, are, not, yet, fully, implemented.[9], India[edit], India, has, Contract, Labor,, Minimum, Wage,, Provident, Funds, Act, and, various, other, acts, to, comply, with., Contract, labor, in, India, must, be, paid, minimum, wage, and, certain, facilities, are, to, be, provided, to, labor., However,, there, is, still, a, large, amount, of, work, that, remains, to, be, done, to, fully, implement, the, Act.[12], Philippines[edit], In, the, Philippines,, private, employment, is, regulated, under, the, Labor, Code, of, the, Philippines, by, the, Department, of, Labor, and, Employment.[19], United, Kingdom[edit], In, the, United, Kingdom,, employment, contracts, are, categorized, by, the, government, into, the, following, types:[20], Fixed-term, contract:, last, for, a, certain, length, of, time,, are, set, in, advance,, end, when, a, specific, task, is, completed,, ends, when, a, specific, event, takes, place., Full-time, or, part-time, contract:, has, no, defined, length, of, time,, can, be, terminated, by, either, party,, is, to, accomplish, a, specific, task,, specified, number, of, hours.[19], Agency, staff, Freelancers,, Consultants,, Contractors, Zero-hour, contracts, United, States[edit], See, also:, United, States, labor, law,, List, of, largest, employers, in, the, United, States,, and, Labor, unions, in, the, United, States, All, employees,, private, industries,, by, branches, For, purposes, of, U.S., federal, income, tax, withholding,, 26, U.S.C., §, 3401(c), provides, a, definition, for, the, term, "employee", specific, to, chapter, 24, of, the, Internal, Revenue, Code:, "For, purposes, of, this, chapter,, the, term, “employee”, includes, an, officer,, employee,, or, elected, official, of, the, United, States,, a, State,, or, any, political, subdivision, thereof,, or, the, District, of, Columbia,, or, any, agency, or, instrumentality, of, any, one, or, more, of, the, foregoing., The, term, “employee”, also, includes, an, officer, of, a, corporation."[21], This, definition, does, not, exclude, all, those, who, are, commonly, known, as, 'employees'., “Similarly,, Latham’s, instruction, which, indicated, that, under, 26, U.S.C., §, 3401(c), the, category, of, ‘employee’, does, not, include, privately, employed, wage, earners, is, a, preposterous, reading, of, the, statute., It, is, obvious, that, within, the, context, of, both, statutes, the, word, ‘includes’, is, a, term, of, enlargement, not, of, limitation,, and, the, reference, to, certain, entities, or, categories, is, not, intended, to, exclude, all, others.”[22], Employees, are, often, contrasted, with, independent, contractors,, especially, when, there, is, dispute, as, to, the, worker's, entitlement, to, have, matching, taxes, paid,, workers, compensation,, and, unemployment, insurance, benefits., However,, in, September, 2009,, the, court, case, of, Brown, v., J., Kaz,, Inc., ruled, that, independent, contractors, are, regarded, as, employees, for, the, purpose, of, discrimination, laws, if, they, work, for, the, employer, on, a, regular, basis,, and, said, employer, directs, the, time,, place,, and, manner, of, employment.[19], In, non-union, work, environments,, in, the, United, States,, unjust, termination, complaints, can, be, brought, to, the, United, States, Department, of, Labor.[23], Labor, unions, are, legally, recognized, as, representatives, of, workers, in, many, industries, in, the, United, States., Their, activity, today, centers, on, collective, bargaining, over, wages,, benefits,, and, working, conditions, for, their, membership,, and, on, representing, their, members, in, disputes, with, management, over, violations, of, contract, provisions., Larger, unions, also, typically, engage, in, lobbying, activities, and, electioneering, at, the, state, and, federal, level.[19], Most, unions, in, America, are, aligned, with, one, of, two, larger, umbrella, organizations:, the, AFL-CIO, created, in, 1955,, and, the, Change, to, Win, Federation, which, split, from, the, AFL-CIO, in, 2005., Both, advocate, policies, and, legislation, on, behalf, of, workers, in, the, United, States, and, Canada,, and, take, an, active, role, in, politics., The, AFL-CIO, is, especially, concerned, with, global, trade, issues.[17], Sweden[edit], According, to, Swedish, law,[24], there, are, three, types, of, employment., Test, employment, (swe:, Provanställning),, where, the, employer, hires, a, person, for, a, test, period, of, 6, months, maximum., The, employment, can, be, ended, at, any, time, without, giving, any, reason., This, type, of, employment, can, be, offered, only, once, per, employer, and, employee, combination., Usually, a, time, limited, or, normal, employment, is, offered, after, a, test, employment.[25], Time, limited, employment, (swe:, Tidsbegränsad, anställning)., The, employer, hires, a, person, for, a, specified, time., Usually, they, are, extended, for, a, new, period., Total, maximum, two, years, per, employer, and, employee, combination,, then, it, automatically, counts, as, a, normal, employment., Normal, employment, (swe:, Tillsvidareanställning, /, Fast, anställning),, which, has, no, time, limit, (except, for, retirement, etc.)., It, can, still, be, ended, for, two, reasons:, personal, reason,, immediate, end, of, employment, only, for, strong, reasons, such, as, crime,, or, lack, of, work, tasks, (swe:, Arbetsbrist),, cancellation, of, employment,, usually, because, of, bad, income, for, the, company., There, is, a, cancellation, period, of, 1–6, months,, and, rules, for, how, to, select, employees,, basically, those, with, shortest, employment, time, shall, be, cancelled, first.[25], There, are, no, laws, about, minimum, salary, in, Sweden., Instead, there, are, agreements, between, employer, organizations, and, trade, unions, about, minimum, salaries,, and, other, employment, conditions., There, is, a, type, of, employment, contract, which, is, common, but, not, regulated, in, law,, and, that, is, Hour, employment, (swe:, Timanställning),, which, can, be, Normal, employment, (unlimited),, but, the, work, time, is, unregulated, and, decided, per, immediate, need, basis., The, employee, is, expected, to, be, answering, the, phone, and, come, to, work, when, needed,, e.g., when, someone, is, ill, and, absent, from, work., They, will, receive, salary, only, for, actual, work, time, and, can, in, reality, be, fired, for, no, reason, by, not, being, called, anymore., This, type, of, contract, is, common, in, the, public, sector.[25], Age-related, issues[edit], Younger, age, workers[edit], Youth, employment, rate, in, the, US,, i.e., the, ratio, of, employed, persons, (15-24Y), in, an, economy, to, total, labor, force, (15-24Y)., [1], Main, article:, Young, worker, safety, and, health, Young, workers, are, at, higher, risk, for, occupational, injury, and, face, certain, occupational, hazards, at, a, higher, rate;, this, is, generally, due, to, their, employment, in, high-risk, industries., For, example,, in, the, United, States,, young, people, are, injured, at, work, at, twice, the, rate, of, their, older, counterparts.[26], These, workers, are, also, at, higher, risk, for, motor, vehicle, accidents, at, work,, due, to, less, work, experience,, a, lower, use, of, seatbelts,, and, higher, rates, of, distracted, driving.[27][28], To, mitigate, this, risk,, those, under, the, age, of, 17, are, restricted, from, certain, types, of, driving,, including, transporting, people, and, goods, under, certain, circumstances.[27], High-risk, industries, for, young, workers, include, agriculture,, restaurants,, waste, management,, and, mining.[26][27], In, the, United, States,, those, under, the, age, of, 18, are, restricted, from, certain, jobs, that, are, deemed, dangerous, under, the, Fair, Labor, Standards, Act.[27], Youth, employment, programs, are, most, effective, when, they, include, both, theoretical, classroom, training, and, hands-on, training, with, work, placements.[29], Older, age, workers[edit], Those, older, than, the, statutory, defined, retirement, age, may, continue, to, work,, either, out, of, enjoyment, or, necessity., However,, depending, on, the, nature, of, the, job,, older, workers, may, need, to, transition, into, less-physical, forms, of, work, to, avoid, injury., Working, past, retirement, age, also, has, positive, effects,, because, it, gives, a, sense, of, purpose, and, allows, people, to, maintain, social, networks, and, activity, levels.[30], Older, workers, are, often, found, to, be, discriminated, against, by, employers.[31], Working, poor[edit], Worker,, Dhaka,, Bangladesh., Employment, is, no, guarantee, of, escaping, poverty,, the, International, Labour, Organization, (ILO), estimates, that, as, many, as, 40%, of, workers, are, poor,, not, earning, enough, to, keep, their, families, above, the, $2, a, day, poverty, line.[25], For, instance,, in, India, most, of, the, chronically, poor, are, wage, earners, in, formal, employment,, because, their, jobs, are, insecure, and, low, paid, and, offer, no, chance, to, accumulate, wealth, to, avoid, risks.[25], According, to, the, UNRISD,, increasing, labor, productivity, appears, to, have, a, negative, impact, on, job, creation:, in, the, 1960s,, a, 1%, increase, in, output, per, worker, was, associated, with, a, reduction, in, employment, growth, of, 0.07%,, by, the, first, decade, of, this, century, the, same, productivity, increase, implies, reduced, employment, growth, by, 0.54%.[25], Both, increased, employment, opportunities, and, increased, labor, productivity, (as, long, as, it, also, translates, into, higher, wages), are, needed, to, tackle, poverty., Increases, in, employment, without, increases, in, productivity, leads, to, a, rise, in, the, number, of, "working, poor",, which, is, why, some, experts, are, now, promoting, the, creation, of, "quality", and, not, "quantity", in, labor, market, policies.[25], This, approach, does, highlight, how, higher, productivity, has, helped, reduce, poverty, in, East, Asia,, but, the, negative, impact, is, beginning, to, show.[25], In, Vietnam,, for, example,, employment, growth, has, slowed, while, productivity, growth, has, continued.[25], Furthermore,, productivity, increases, do, not, always, lead, to, increased, wages,, as, can, be, seen, in, the, United, States,, where, the, gap, between, productivity, and, wages, has, been, rising, since, the, 1980s.[25], Researchers, at, the, Overseas, Development, Institute, argue, that, there, are, differences, across, economic, sectors, in, creating, employment, that, reduces, poverty.[25], 24, instances, of, growth, were, examined,, in, which, 18, reduced, poverty., This, study, showed, that, other, sectors, were, just, as, important, in, reducing, unemployment,, such, as, manufacturing.[25], The, services, sector, is, most, effective, at, translating, productivity, growth, into, employment, growth., Agriculture, provides, a, safety, net, for, jobs, and, economic, buffer, when, other, sectors, are, struggling.[25], Growth,, employment, and, poverty[25], Number, of, episodes, Rising, agricultural, employment, Rising, industrial, employment, Rising, services, employment, Growth, episodes, associated, with, falling, poverty, rates, 18, 6, 10, 15, Growth, episodes, associated, with, no, fall, in, poverty, rates, 6, 2, 3, 1, Models, of, the, employment, relationship[edit], Scholars, conceptualize, the, employment, relationship, in, various, ways.[32], A, key, assumption, is, the, extent, to, which, the, employment, relationship, necessarily, includes, conflicts, of, interests, between, employers, and, employees,, and, the, form, of, such, conflicts.[33], In, economic, theorizing,, the, labor, market, mediates, all, such, conflicts, such, that, employers, and, employees, who, enter, into, an, employment, relationship, are, assumed, to, find, this, arrangement, in, their, own, self-interest., In, human, resource, management, theorizing,, employers, and, employees, are, assumed, to, have, shared, interests, (or, a, unity, of, interests,, hence, the, label, “unitarism”)., Any, conflicts, that, exist, are, seen, as, a, manifestation, of, poor, human, resource, management, policies, or, interpersonal, clashes, such, as, personality, conflicts,, both, of, which, can, and, should, be, managed, away., From, the, perspective, of, pluralist, industrial, relations,, the, employment, relationship, is, characterized, by, a, plurality, of, stakeholders, with, legitimate, interests, (hence, the, label, “pluralism),, and, some, conflicts, of, interests, are, seen, as, inherent, in, the, employment, relationship, (e.g.,, wages, v., profits)., Lastly,, the, critical, paradigm, emphasizes, antagonistic, conflicts, of, interests, between, various, groups, (e.g.,, the, competing, capitalist, and, working, classes, in, a, Marxist, framework), that, are, part, of, a, deeper, social, conflict, of, unequal, power, relations., As, a, result,, there, are, four, common, models, of, employment:[34], Mainstream, economics:, employment, is, seen, as, a, mutually, advantageous, transaction, in, a, free, market, between, self-interested, legal, and, economic, equals, Human, resource, management, (unitarism):, employment, is, a, long-term, partnership, of, employees, and, employers, with, common, interests, Pluralist, industrial, relations:, employment, is, a, bargained, exchange, between, stakeholders, with, some, common, and, some, competing, economic, interests, and, unequal, bargaining, power, due, to, imperfect, labor, markets[25], Critical, industrial, relations:, employment, is, an, unequal, power, relation, between, competing, groups, that, is, embedded, in, and, inseparable, from, systemic, inequalities, throughout, the, socio-politico-economic, system., These, models, are, important, because, they, help, reveal, why, individuals, hold, differing, perspectives, on, human, resource, management, policies,, labor, unions,, and, employment, regulation.[35], For, example,, human, resource, management, policies, are, seen, as, dictated, by, the, market, in, the, first, view,, as, essential, mechanisms, for, aligning, the, interests, of, employees, and, employers, and, thereby, creating, profitable, companies, in, the, second, view,, as, insufficient, for, looking, out, for, workers’, interests, in, the, third, view,, and, as, manipulative, managerial, tools, for, shaping, the, ideology, and, structure, of, the, workplace, in, the, fourth, view.[36], Academic, literature[edit], Literature, on, the, employment, impact, of, economic, growth, and, on, how, growth, is, associated, with, employment, at, a, macro,, sector, and, industry, level, was, aggregated, in, 2013.[37], Researchers, found, evidence, to, suggest, growth, in, manufacturing, and, services, have, good, impact, on, employment., They, found, GDP, growth, on, employment, in, agriculture, to, be, limited,, but, that, value-added, growth, had, a, relatively, larger, impact.[25], The, impact, on, job, creation, by, industries/economic, activities, as, well, as, the, extent, of, the, body, of, evidence, and, the, key, studies., For, extractives,, they, again, found, extensive, evidence, suggesting, growth, in, the, sector, has, limited, impact, on, employment., In, textiles, however,, although, evidence, was, low,, studies, suggest, growth, there, positively, contributed, to, job, creation., In, agri-business, and, food, processing,, they, found, impact, growth, to, be, positive.[37], They, found, that, most, available, literature, focuses, on, OECD, and, middle-income, countries, somewhat,, where, economic, growth, impact, has, been, shown, to, be, positive, on, employment., The, researchers, didn't, find, sufficient, evidence, to, conclude, any, impact, of, growth, on, employment, in, LDCs, despite, some, pointing, to, the, positive, impact,, others, point, to, limitations., They, recommended, that, complementary, policies, are, necessary, to, ensure, economic, growth's, positive, impact, on, LDC, employment., With, trade,, industry, and, investment,, they, only, found, limited, evidence, of, positive, impact, on, employment, from, industrial, and, investment, policies, and, for, others,, while, large, bodies, of, evidence, does, exist,, the, exact, impact, remains, contested.[37], Globalization, and, employment, relations[edit], The, balance, of, economic, efficiency, and, social, equity, is, the, ultimate, debate, in, the, field, of, employment, relations.[38], By, meeting, the, needs, of, the, employer;, generating, profits, to, establish, and, maintain, economic, efficiency;, whilst, maintaining, a, balance, with, the, employee, and, creating, social, equity, that, benefits, the, worker, so, that, he/she, can, fund, and, enjoy, healthy, living;, proves, to, be, a, continuous, revolving, issue, in, westernized, societies.[38], Globalization, has, effected, these, issues, by, creating, certain, economic, factors, that, disallow, or, allow, various, employment, issues., Economist, Edward, Lee, (1996), studies, the, effects, of, globalization, and, summarizes, the, four, major, points, of, concern, that, affect, employment, relations:, International, competition,, from, the, newly, industrialized, countries,, will, cause, unemployment, growth, and, increased, wage, disparity, for, unskilled, workers, in, industrialized, countries., Imports, from, low-wage, countries, exert, pressure, on, the, manufacturing, sector, in, industrialized, countries, and, foreign, direct, investment, (FDI), is, attracted, away, from, the, industrialized, nations,, towards, low-waged, countries.[38], Economic, liberalization, will, result, in, unemployment, and, wage, inequality, in, developing, countries., This, happens, as, job, losses, in, uncompetitive, industries, outstrip, job, opportunities, in, new, industries., Workers, will, be, forced, to, accept, worsening, wages, and, conditions,, as, a, global, labor, market, results, in, a, “race, to, the, bottom”., Increased, international, competition, creates, a, pressure, to, reduce, the, wages, and, conditions, of, workers.[38], Globalization, reduces, the, autonomy, of, the, nation, state., Capital, is, increasingly, mobile, and, the, ability, of, the, state, to, regulate, economic, activity, is, reduced., What, also, results, from, Lee’s, (1996), findings, is, that, in, industrialized, countries, an, average, of, almost, 70, per, cent, of, workers, are, employed, in, the, service, sector,, most, of, which, consists, of, non-tradable, activities., As, a, result,, workers, are, forced, to, become, more, skilled, and, develop, sought, after, trades,, or, find, other, means, of, survival., Ultimately, this, is, a, result, of, changes, and, trends, of, employment,, an, evolving, workforce,, and, globalization, that, is, represented, by, a, more, skilled, and, increasing, highly, diverse, labor, force,, that, are, growing, in, non, standard, forms, of, employment, (Markey,, R., et, al., 2006).[38], Alternatives[edit], Subcultures[edit], Various, youth, subcultures, have, been, associated, with, not, working,, such, as, the, hippie, subculture, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, (which, endorsed, the, idea, of, "dropping, out", of, society), and, the, punk, subculture,, in, which, some, members, live, in, anarchist, squats, (illegal, housing)., Postsecondary, education[edit], One, of, the, alternatives, to, work, is, engaging, in, postsecondary, education, at, a, college,, university, or, professional, school., One, of, the, major, costs, of, obtaining, a, postsecondary, education, is, the, opportunity, cost, of, forgone, wages, due, to, not, working., At, times, when, jobs, are, hard, to, find,, such, as, during, recessions,, unemployed, individuals, may, decide, to, get, postsecondary, education,, because, there, is, less, of, an, opportunity, cost., Workplace, democracy[edit], Main, article:, Workplace, democracy, Workplace, democracy, is, the, application, of, democracy, in, all, its, forms, (including, voting, systems,, debates,, democratic, structuring,, due, process,, adversarial, process,, systems, of, appeal), to, the, workplace.[39], Self-employment[edit], When, an, individual, entirely, owns, the, business, for, which, they, labor,, this, is, known, as, self-employment., Self-employment, often, leads, to, incorporation., Incorporation, offers, certain, protections, of, one's, personal, assets.[38], Individuals, who, are, self-employed, may, own, a, small, business., They, may, also, be, considered, to, be, an, entrepreneur., Social, assistance[edit], In, some, countries,, individuals, who, are, not, working, can, receive, social, assistance, support, (e.g.,, welfare, or, food, stamps), to, enable, them, to, rent, housing,, buy, food,, repair, or, replace, household, goods,, maintenance, of, children, and, observe, social, customs, that, require, financial, expenditure., Volunteerism[edit], Workers, who, are, not, paid, wages,, such, as, volunteers, who, perform, tasks, for, charities,, hospitals, or, not-for-profit, organizations,, are, generally, not, considered, employed., One, exception, to, this, is, an, internship,, an, employment, situation, in, which, the, worker, receives, training, or, experience, (and, possibly, college, credit), as, the, chief, form, of, compensation.[39], Indentured, servitude, and, slavery[edit], Those, who, work, under, obligation, for, the, purpose, of, fulfilling, a, debt,, such, as, an, indentured, servant,, or, as, property, of, the, person, or, entity, they, work, for,, such, as, a, slave,, do, not, receive, pay, for, their, services, and, are, not, considered, employed., Some, historians, suggest, that, slavery, is, older, than, employment,, but, both, arrangements, have, existed, for, all, recorded, history., Indentured, servitude, and, slavery, are, not, considered, compatible, with, human, rights, and, democracy.[39], See, also[edit], Automation, Basic, income, Domestic, inquiry, Employer, branding, Employment, gap, Employment, rate, Employment, website, Equal, opportunity, employment, Equal,
