Jazz, Singers, Technology, List, 7, Deadliest, Weapons, in, History, Encyclopædia, Britannica,, Inc., They’re, known, as, “charismatic, megafauna”, for, a, reason., These, endangered, animals, ooze, star, power,, a, factor, that, conservationists, have, capitalized, on, in, order, to, fund, projects, to, protect, them, (and,, often, by, default,, the, other, organisms, that, share, their, complex, ecosystems)., People, are, far, more, likely, to, donate, money, to, save, an, adorable, panda, or, a, magnificent, tiger, than, they, are, to, drop, some, shekels, on, preserving, the, limbless, worm, skink, or, the, Gerlach’s, cockroach., However,, skinks, and, roaches, are, integral, participants, in, their, ecosystems, as, well, and, just, as, deserving, of, assistance, as, their, flashier, compatriots., You, might, then, consider, the, animals, on, this, list, the, A-listers, whose, box, office, draw, finances, the, continued, existence, of, the, lesser-known, character, actors, who, inhabit, the, same, environments., And, if, the, concept, of, trickle-down, conservation, sticks, in, your, craw,, get, to, work, on, that, “save, the, Gerlach’s, cockroach”, Kickstarter, campaign., I’d, donate., Maybe., 10giant, panda, (Ailuropoda, melanoleuca), Jeff, Tinsley/Smithsonian, Institution, Everyone, loves, a, panda…they, might, be, the, kitschiest, animal, humanity, has, driven, to, the, brink, of, extinction, yet., From, stuffed, animals, to, martial, arts-trained, CGI, abominations,, we, just, can’t, seem, to, get, enough, of, the, bi-colored, beasts., Though, their, “aww, factor”, may, verge, on, the, cloying,, it, hasn’t, been, without, effect., China,, which, is, home, to, the, remaining, wild, population, of, fewer, than, 2,500, individuals,, has, since, the, late, 1980s, instituted, more, stringent, habitat, protections, and, poaching, has, all, but, ceased., Their, status, is, still, tenuous,, though., Their, range, is, fragmented, and, they, are, still, subject, to, disease,, occasional, predation,, and, starvation, when, large, swathes, of, the, bamboo, on, which, they, feed, completes, its, life, cycle, and, dies., 9tiger, (Panthera, tigris), AdstockRF, William, Blake’s, “forests, of, the, night,”, the, stalking, grounds, of, the, six, subspecies, of, tiger,, are, burning, bright., Slash-and-burn, agriculture,, along, with, logging,, and, human, encroachment,, have, hugely, diminished, the, habitat, available, to, these, felines,, which, require, extensive, ranges, capable, of, supporting, the, large, herbivores, that, constitute, the, bulk, of, their, diets., Poaching—for, trophies, and, body, parts, used, in, Asian, “medicine”, —is, thought, to, pose, the, greatest, threat, to, tigers., Probably, fewer, than, 4,000, are, left, in, the, wild., In, 2014,, China, explicitly, outlawed, the, consumption, of, endangered, species,, including, tigers,, whose, bones,, penises,, and, other, organs, are, superstitiously, believed, to, have, magical, curative, powers., 8whooping, crane, (Grus, americana), International, Crane, Foundation,, Baraboo,, WI., In, 1938,, the, first, year, a, population, survey, was, conducted,, only, 29, whooping, cranes, remained, in, the, wild., Three, years, later,, only, 16, were, left., Hunting, and, reduction, of, their, wetland, habitat, had, vitiated, the, population, and, concerted, efforts, to, salvage, remnant, birds, did, not, being, until, the, late, 1960s., Today,, there, are, over, 400, birds,, thanks, in, large, part, to, innovative, breeding, programs., Though, a, plan, that, involved, transferring, whooping, crane, eggs, to, the, nests, of, related, sandhill, cranes, for, fostering, ultimately, failed,, captive, rearing, and, reintroduction, have, established, two, wild, populations, in, Florida,, one, of, which, has, been, taught, to, migrate, to, Wisconsin., Neither, is, self-sustaining., The, only, self-sustaining, population, migrates, between, Alberta,, Canada,, and, Texas,, U.S., 7blue, whale, (Balaenoptera, musculus), NaturePL/SuperStock, There, are, fewer, than, 25,000, blue, whales,, the, largest, animals, on, the, planet., Comprising, several, subspecies,, blue, whales, are, found, in, all, of, the, world’s, oceans, save, the, Arctic., The, current, population, is, thought, to, have, been, reduced, by, up, to, 90%, by, whaling, in, the, 20th, century., Commercial, hunting, of, the, species, was, ultimately, banned, in, 1966., The, National, Marine, Fisheries, Service, of, the, U.S., spelled, out, a, recovery, plan, in, 1998., It, stipulated, the, maintenance, of, photo, databases, of, individual, specimens, and, the, collection, of, genetic, and, migration, data, in, order, to, better, understand, the, species,, which, remains, at, risk, from, ship, collisions, and, entanglement, in, fishing, nets., 6Asian, elephant, (Elephas, maximus), ©, SunnyS/Fotolia, The, IUCN’s, best, guess, on, the, current, population, of, Asian, elephants,, which, inhabit, 13, countries,, is, around, 40,000–50,000., That, number, may, be, far, lower;, some, regions, inhabited, by, the, lumbering, pachyderms, are, inaccessible, due, to, the, terrain, or, to, political, volatility., Over, 50%, of, the, population, is, concentrated, in, India., The, burgeoning, human, population, there—and, elsewhere, in, Asia—creates, conflicts, for, space, and, resources., And, while, the, tusks, of, Asian, elephants, are, much, smaller, than, those, of, their, African, counterparts,, the, Asian, species, is, still, poached, for, its, ivory,, meat,, and, skin., 5sea, otter, (Enhydra, lutris), ©, Only, Fabrizio/Fotolia, The, luxurious, waterproof, coat, that, insulates, sea, otters, from, the, chilly, waters, that, they, inhabit, almost, led, to, its, extinction., A, target, of, the, commercial, fur, trade,, the, species, was, almost, wiped, out,, with, only, some, 2,000, of, an, estimated, 300,000, left, by, 1911., That, year,, an, international, ban, on, commercial, hunting, was, enacted., Though, that, ban,, along, with, management, and, conservation, measures, taken, in, the, wake, of, the, 1972, Marine, Mammal, Protection, Act,, have, helped, populations, recover, to, perhaps, a, third, of, their, earlier, numbers,, they, are, highly, vulnerable, to, both, natural, phenomena, such, as, killer, whale, predation, and, to, anthropogenic, factors, such, as, oil, spills., 4snow, leopard, (Panthera, uncia), ©, wyssu/Fotolia, Though, it’s, called, a, leopard—and, certainly, resembles, a, frosted, version, of, those, spotted, habitués, of, more, equatorial, regions—the, snow, leopard, is, actually, more, closely, related, to, the, tiger,, at, least, per, genetic, analysis., Probably, fewer, than, 6,500, remain, in, the, wild,, though, due, to, the, remote, mountainous, terrain, preferred, by, the, species,, and, its, elusive, nature,, data, is, hard, to, come, by., The, largest, populations, are, in, China, and, Mongolia,, with, significant, populations, in, India, and, Kyrgyzstan, as, well., Its, natural, prey, include, blue, sheep, and, ibex,, but, in, some, areas,, it, is, heavily, dependent, on, domestic, animals., The, farmers, who, depend, upon, the, animals, shoot, the, “problem”, leopards., Poaching, still, constitutes, a, major, threat, to, the, species,, as, does, overhunting, of, its, natural, prey, species., 3gorilla, (Gorilla, beringei, andGorilla, gorilla), Richard, Gruggiero/U.S., Fish, and, Wildlife, Service, Depending, on, who, you, ask,, there, are, either, two, species, of, gorilla,, the, eastern, (Gorilla, beringei), and, western, (Gorilla, gorilla),, or, three, subspecies,, the, eastern, lowland,, western, lowland,, and, mountain, gorillas., Regardless, of, who, you, ask,, all, gorillas, are, endangered., There, are, probably, only, around, 220,000, left, in, the, wild., Habitat, encroachment, and, poaching, for, bushmeat,, trophies,, and, magical, talismans, have, led, to, substantial, losses., Because, their, social, structure, is, so, complex, and, because, they, reproduce, slowly—with, females, only, giving, birth, once, every, four, years, at, best—the, removal, of, even, a, few, individuals, from, a, gorilla, troop, can, catastrophically, impact, its, ability, to, sustain, itself., 2Tasmanian, devil, (Sarcophilus, harrisii), iStockphoto/Thinkstock, Between, 1996, and, 2008,, the, population, of, Tasmanian, devils, dropped, some, 60%, due, a, contagious, cancer, known, as, Devil, Facial, Tumour, Disease., It, continues, to, decimate, populations, of, the, species,, which, only, occurs, on, the, Australian, island, of, Tasmania., There, may, only, be, 10,000, wild, individuals, remaining., Captive, breeding, of, uninfected, individuals, has, been, instituted, and, efforts, have, been, made, to, develop, a, vaccine, for, the, cancer,, which, is, thought, to, have, stemmed, from, mutated, cells, from, a, single, specimen., 1orangutan, (Pongo, pygmaeus), John, Warden—Stone/Getty, Images, “Orangutan”, is, Malaysian, for, “person, of, the, forest.”, Though, morphologically, they, may, resemble, melted, Muppets, more, than, people,, their, sophisticated, cognitive, abilities, are, very, human, indeed., Like, gorillas, and, chimpanzees,, they, have, been, known, to, use, tools., Due, in, large, part, to, logging, and, capture, for, the, exotic, pet, trade,, orangutans—restricted, to, the, Southeast, Asian, islands, of, Borneo, and, Sumatra—number, fewer, than, 60,000, per, a, 2004, study., Unlike, other, great, apes,, they, are, usually, solitary, or, live, in, groups, of, fewer, than, three,, making, them, difficult, to, track, and, study.,
