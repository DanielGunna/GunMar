changed, in, details, through, the, years,, but, never, supplanted., The, following, chart, —, of, my, own, design, —, (which, depicts, the, position, of, the, free-reed, instruments, in, relation,

medium, for, the, production, of, sound., The, aerophones, are, divided, into, two, subsets:, the, pipe, aerophones, and, the, free, aerophones., The, pipe, aerophones, (the, oboe,, bassoon,, clarinet,, saxophone,, etc.), regulate, pitch, by, changing, the, length, of, the, pipe;, the, size, of, the, reed, does, not, change., On, the, other, hand,, the, free, aerophones, regulate, pitch, by, changing, the, length, (and, thickness), of, the, reed., Many, free, aerophones, do, not, use, pipes, (accordion,, concertina,, etc.),, but, for, those, instruments, that, do, have, pipes, (such, as, the, shêng,, shô,, khaen, and, organ, reed, pipes),, pipe, length, has, no, effect, on, the, pitch,, although, the, pipe, does, function, as, an, acoustical, reinforcement, for, the, sound., The, free, aerophones, can, be, further, divided, into, two, subsets:, beating, reeds, and, free-reeds., Organ, reeds, are, referred, to, as, beating, reeds, because, the, tongue, is, larger, than, the, shallot, opening, and, therefore, beats, against, it., In, a, free-reed,, on, the, other, hand,, the, tongue, is, smaller, than, the, opening, and, so, vibrates, through, rather, than, against, it., Most, tongues, of, free-reeds, are, made, from, metal,, but, tongues, of, primitive, free-reed, instruments,, like, the, naw,, are, made, from, cane., The, free-reed, instruments, are, divided, into, two, more, subsets:, the, unframed, reed, and, the, framed, reed., The, simplest, reed, instruments, are, those, which, have, no, openings, to, channel, the, wind, or, frames, within, which, the, reeds, can, vibrate., The, aeolian, harp,, a, musical, instrument, played, by, the, wind,, can, be, convincingly, classified, as, a, free-reed, instrument,, although, it, is, customarily, categorized, as, a, chordophone., The, instrument,, named, after, Aeolus,, the, Greek, god, of, wind,, is, made, of, a, wooden, sound, box, loosely, strung, with, ten, or, twelve, gut, strings, varying, in, thickness, and, elasticity,, usually, tuned, in, unison., In, the, wind, they, vibrate, in, aliquot, parts, (i.e.,, in, halves,, thirds,, fourths,, etc.), thus, sounding, the, octave,, 12th,, second, octave,, and, succeedingly, higher, harmonics, of, the, string's, fundamental, note,, which, is, silent., According, to, legend,, King, David, hung, his, kinnor, (a, kind, of, lyre), above, his, head, at, night, to, catch, the, wind., In, the, tenth, century,, Dustan, of, Canterbury, was, charged, with, sorcery, when, the, wind, produced, sound, from, his, harp., The, first, known, Aeolian, harp, was, constructed, by, the, Jesuit, priest, and, scholar,, Athanasius, Kircher, (1601-1680),, and, was, described, in, his, Musurgia, Universalis, (1650)., The, instrument, became, popular, in, Germany, and, England, during, the, romantic, period., Two, attempts, to, devise, a, keybard, version, using, a, bellows, were, the, anémocorde, (1788), by, Johann, Jacob, Schnell, and, the, piano, éolien, (1837), by, M., Isouard., One, familiar, form, of, the, aeolian, harp, is, the, musical, tones, produced, by, the, wind, in, telephone, wires,, which, can, be, amplified, by, placing, the, ear, to, the, side, of, the, pole., (*2), The, Jew's, harp, (sometimes, called, Jaw, harp), is, another, instrument, which, cannot, be, conclusively, categorized., The, first, mention, of, this, instrument, in, this, context, was, made, by, Sebastian, Virdung,, who, grouped, the, Jew's, harp, together, with, rustic, instruments,, such, as, hunting, horns,, bird, calls,, and, bells, in, his, Musica, Getutscht, (Basel,, 1511)., About, a, century, later,, in, Theatrum, Instrumentorum, (1618),, Michael, Praetorius, classed, the, Jew's, harp, with, the, hurdy-gurdy,, the, viele,, the, horn,, the, triangle,, and, the, bell., A, far, more, precise, approach, to, classification, was, made, by, the, famous, seventeenth-century, musicologist, Marin, Mersenne, (although, he, appeared, to, have, two, views, on, this, matter):, In, Traité, des, instruments, de, Musique, (1640),, Pierre, Trichet, stated, that, Mersenne, regarded, the, Jew's, harp, as, a, "pneumatic", instrument,, since, breath, participated, in, producing, its, sounds,, but, in, Harmonie, Universelle, (1646),, he, termed, it, a, chromatic, or, percussion, instrument,, because, breath, alone,, without, striking,, does, not, make, it, yield, any, sound., Modern, attempts, to, classify, the, Jew's, harp, have, not, settled, the, issue., Curt, Sachs, invented, the, term, "plucked, idiophone", for, the, instrument,, which, produces, sounds, due, to, the, rigidity, and, elasticity, of, the, material, from, which, it, is, made., More, recently,, Frederick, Crane, and, Ole, Kai, Ledang, have, returned, to, Mersenne's, original, view, and, have, classified, the, Jew's, harp, as, an, aerophone,, arguing, that, full, functioning, of, the, instrument, occurs, only, when, a, stream, of, air, moves, past, its, tongue., (*3), Another, example, of, the, unframed, reed, is, the, primitive, bull-roarer., A, spatulate, stone,, bone,, or, board,, sometimes, carved, in, the, shape, of, a, fish,, is, tied, through, a, small, hole, to, a, string,, which, in, turn, is, attached, to, a, stick;, when, the, instrument, is, whirled, around,, it, produces, a, sound, by, its, disturbance, of, the, air., Primitive, societies, believe, this, instrument, has, magical, properties., This, instrument, appeared, in, the, 1986, movie, Clan, of, the, Cave, Bear., Another, primitive, free-reed, instrument, is, the, leaf, (called, bilu),, which, can, be, heard, in, some, traditional, Chinese, music, ensembles., A, leaf,, or, a, long, blade, of, grass,, is, stretched, between, the, sides, of, the, thumbs, and, tensioned, slightly, by, bending, the, thumbs,, thereby, raising, or, lowering, the, pitch., The, tone, of, the, instrument, can, be, modified, by, cupping, the, hands, so, as, to, provide, a, resonant, chamber., Like, the, aeolian, harp,, the, reed, is, secured, at, each, end, and, the, center, length, is, allowed, to, vibrate, about, its, fixed, ends., The, quality, of, sound, can, also, be, altered, by, changing, the, thickness, of, the, leaf., This, instrument, is, extremely, hard, to, classify, exactly,, since,, depending, on, the, shape, of, the, cavity, created, between, the, thumbs,, the, grass, reed, can, be, proved, to, be, both, beating, and, free,, or, neither., All, other, free-reed, instruments, have, a, frame, through, which, the, tongue, vibrates., The, framed, free-reed, instruments, can, further, be, divided, into, four, subsets:, mouth, blown,, hand, blown,, foot, blown, and, mechanically, blown., This, classification, is, convenient,, but, not, necessarily, logical,, as, some, instruments, may, belong, to, more, than, one, class., As, mentioned, above,, the, Jew's, harp, may, be, classified, as, an, aerophone, or, a, plucked, idiophone., The, aeolian, harp, may, be, classified, as, an, aerophone, or, a, chordophone., In, addition,, the, organ, belongs, to, both, the, edge, instruments, and, reed, pipe, instruments., The, violin, can, be, categorized, as, a, bowed, chordophone, or, a, plucked, chordophone,, depending, on, whether, it, is, player, arco, or, pizzicato., The, tambourine, is, a, membranophone, in, so, far, as, it, has, a, skin, head, which, is, struck;, but,, if, it, is, only, shaken, so, that, its, jingles, sound,, it, should, be, classed, as, an, idiophone,, for, in, this, case, the, skin, head, is, irrelevant., The, accordion, may, also, belong, to, more, than, one, family., The, American, accordionist/composer, Guy, Klucevsek, has, written, a, piece, for, solo, accordion,, Eleven, Large, Lobsters, Loose, In, The, Lobby, (1991), which, does, not, use, the, reeds, of, the, accordion., The, performer, produces, sounds, by, clicking, the, register, switches,, tapping, the, keys,, and, other, percussive, means., In, this, piece, the, accordion, is, used, as, an, idiophone, and, not, as, a, free-reed., Twentieth-century, hybrids, like, the, Cordovox, are, properly, categorized, as, an, instrument, which, combines, more, than, one, category:, it, is, simultaneously, a, free-reed, instrument, and, also, an, electromagnetic, instrument., Of, course, the, reedless, accordion, --, the, MIDI, accordion, --, cannot, be, classified, as, a, free-reed, instrument, since, it, has, no, reeds., It, is, solely, a, digital, instrument., The, free-reed, instruments, can, be, further, subdivided, according, to, various, features, such, as:, Direction, of, wind, pressure, (positive,, negative, or, both), Playing, method, (lips,, fingers, over, holes,, keys,, buttons,, and, mechanical, means, such, as, cogs, in, barrels,, punched, cards,, etc.), Scale, (pentatonic,, diatonic,, chromatic), The, Australian, musicologist, and, harmonium, enthusiast,, Diarmuid, Pigott, --, curator, of, the, Harmonium, Home, Page, --, created, the, following, chart, categorizing, the, free-reed, instruments, in, greater, detail,, on, which, I, have, expanded, upon., The, Free-Reed, Family, of, Aerophones,

Chromatic, Electric, Chord, Organ, As, noted, above,, the, free-reed, instruments, can, be, classified, according, to, their, type, of, musical, scale, into, two, categories:, diatonic, and, chromatic, instruments,, (*6), although, some, Oriental, instruments, can, play, only, a, pentatonic, scale., The, diatonic, instruments, are, limited, to, the, tones, of, a, standard, major, or, minor, scale, without, the, chromatic, intervals;, therefore,, diatonic, instruments, can, play, in, only, one, key., (Bi-diatonic, instruments, can, play, in, two, keys.), On, the, other, hand,, chromatic, instruments, can, play, all, twelve, tones, of, the, chromatic, scale., Free-reed, instruments, can, still, be, further, divided, into, single-action, instruments, and, double-action, instruments., The, single-action, instruments, have, two, different, pitches, per, button;, that, is,, one, pitch, sounds, when, the, bellows, are, opened, and, another, pitch, sounds, when, the, bellows, are, closed., The, double-action, instruments, sound, the, same, note, on, the, press, as, on, the, draw., All, piano-accordions, are, chromatic, double-action, instruments., Footnotes:, (*1), The, human, voice, may, be, classified, as, a, double-reed, aerophone, in, which, the, vocal, chords, act, as, a, double, reed, and, the, cavities, of, the, throat,, mouth,, sinuses,, and, nose, form, the, resonant, area., The, British, musicologist,, Robert, Donington,, has, called, the, voice, a, throat, instrument., (*2), Philip, W., Goetz,, Editor, in, Chief,, The, New, Encyclopædia, Britannica,, 15th, edition,, Vol., 1, (Chicago,, Encyclopædia, Britannica,, Inc.:, 1991),, 118., (*3), Leonard, Fox,, The, Jew's, Harp:, A, Comprehensive, Anthology, (Toronto,, Bucknell, University, Press:, 1988),, 15,, 16., (*4), The, term, "piano-accordion", is, a, misnomer,, since, the, piano-accordion, keyboard, has, very, little, in, common, with, the, piano, keyboard;, it, is, more, similar, to, an, organ, keyboard., In, my, opinion,, "organ-accordion", or, "keyboard-accordion", are, more, accurate, terms,, but, since, "piano-accordion", is, so, widely, accepted,, I, will, use, it., (*5), The, inventor, of, this, instrument,, Aaron, Merrill, Peaseley, of, Boston,, Massachusetts,, stated, that, either, a, force, bellows,, or, a, suction, bellows, may, be, employed., He, wrote, in, the, patent, record,, "an, improvement, in, organs,, ..., substituting, in, place, of, the, pipes, usually, called, reed, pipes, a, plate, of, metal, or, any, other, fit, substance, in, which, [are, cut], a, number, of, holes, of, proper, form,, in, each, of, which, is, fitted, a, piece, of, brass, or, any, other, elastic, substance, capable, of, vibrating, so, as, to, produce, a, tone.", A., M., Peaseley,, cited, in, The, Musical, Courier,, October, 15,, 1884., In, turn,, cited, by, Robert, F., Gellerman,, The, American, Reed, Organ, and, the, Harmonium, (Vestal,, New, York:, The, Vestal, Press,, 1996),, 9., (*6), The, terms, diatonic, and, chromatic, may, have, yet, other, meanings, in, different, contexts., Christian, Mensing,, the, Swiss, bandonéon, aficionado,, wrote,, "Although, you, are, perfectly, right, using, the, term, chromatic, and, diatonic,, in, the, case, of, the, concertina, and, bandonéon, at, least,, chromatic, means, that, the, same, notes, are, produced, on, one, button, when, you, open, or, close, the, bellows,, while, diatonic, means, that, the, tones, are, different., (This, confusion, may, arise, from, the, earlier, small, instruments, where, the, chromatic, intervals, were, distributed, on, both, senses, [manuals],, such, as, the, Wheatstone, concertinas.), To, avoid, confusion, I, use, the, terms, unisonoric, and, bisonoric, (or, single-action, and, double-action,, as, you, prefer)., Most, of, the, early, bandonéons, were, designed, only, to, play, in, a, few, keys, and, the, performer, had, to, change, the, instrument, in, order, to, change, keys.", Christian, Mensing,, from, an, e-mail, letter, to, the, author, dated, December, 4,, 1996., Part, Three:, Eastern, Free-Reed, Instruments, Part, Four:, Western, Free-Reed,
