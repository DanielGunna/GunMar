[5, Directors, You've, Never, Heard, Of,    ,  I, assume, that,, as, a, fully, functioning, American, if, not, a, film, fanatic,, you've, at, least, heard, of, such, noted, auteurs, (that's, a, fancy, word, for, directors), as, Alfred, Hitchcock,, Stanley, Kubrick,, Woody, Allen,, Francis, Ford, Coppola,, Spike, Lee,, and, Martin, Scorsese,, not, to, mention, such, popular, favorites, as, Steven, Spielberg, and, George, Lucas.  I, also, assume, that, you, are, familiar, with, such, notable, international, film, figures, as, Francois, Truffaut,, Jean-Luc, Godard,, and, Jean, Renoir, of, France,, Ingmar, Bergman, of, Sweden,, Federico, Fellini,, Vittorio, de, Sica,, and, Michelangelo, Antonioni, of, Italy,, Akira, Kurosawa, of, Japan,, Luis, Buñuel, of, Spain, and, Mexico,, Andrei, Tarkovsky, of, Russia,, and, Satyajit, Ray, of, India.  Of, course,, if, you, haven’t, heard, of, them,, that’s, okay.  Just, keep, in, mind, that, this, discussion, will, not, focus, on, the, traditionally, “great”, directors,, even, if, their, names, are, totally, unfamiliar, to, you.  As, a, result,, I, will, also, ignore, such, noted, Hollywood, directors, of, the, past, as, Frank, Capra,, George, Cukor,, George, Stevens,, William, Wyler,, Billy, Wilder,, John, Huston,, and, several, others,, although, they, have, all, made, noteworthy, films.  I, am, also, not, including,, for, the, purposes, of, space,, such, talented, directors, as, Ken, Russell,, Nicholas, Ray,, Howard, Hawks,, Oliver, Stone,, and, Tim, Burton,, whose, films, I, definitely, admire.  I, am, not, including, them, because, I, have, seen, too, little, of, their, work, to, know, their, specific, sensibilities, and, whether, I, can, wholeheartedly, recommend, even, their, misfires, (and, all, directors, have, misfires), as, worth, watching,, based, on, what, I, know, of, there, talents.  Finally,, of, course,, I, am, not, including, such, cinematic, pioneers, as, D.W., Griffith,, Sergei, Eisenstein,, Jean, Vigo,, F.W., Murnau,, Carl, Dreyer,, Charles, Chaplin,, Buster, Keaton,, and, Jacques, Tati,, because, quite, frankly, I, am, completely, unfamiliar, with, most, of, their, work., Hopefully,, that, will, change, in, the, future.,      The, 5, directors, that, I, will, discuss, on, this, page, are, not, necessarily, the, 5, greatest, film, directors, of, all, time.,  I, am, not, a, devotee, of, the, auteur, theory,, and, I, believe, in, evaluating, films,, not, directors.  Still,, these, directors, have, consistently, produced, work, along, thematic, lines, that, I, strongly, identify, with,, and, all, of, their, films, that, I, have, seen, have, impressed, and/or, fascinated, me, to, some, degree.  Not, every, film, has, been, a, success,, but, nevertheless, I, would, be, interested, any, movie, where, one, of, these, five, is, credited, as, the, director,, and, I, would, highly, recommend, any, of, their, films, (although, some, more, than, others), to, you., 5.      Robert, Altman,      Robert, Altman, was, born, on, February, 20,, 1925,, in, Kansas, City,, Missouri.  As, a, young, man,, he, attended, Catholic,, public,, and, military, schools.  He, was, a, fighter, pilot, for, a, short, time, after, World, War, II,, and, first, got, interested, in, filmmaking, after, his, discharge,, as, an, employee, of, the, Calvin, Co.  After, a, series, of, unnoticed, independent, films,, he, got, his, first, break, in, the, world, of, television,, directing, episodes, of, "Alfred, Hitchcock, Presents."  From, there, he, went, on, to, other, television, shows,, including, "Peter, Gunn,", "Bonanza,", and, "Route, 66."  His, big, break, in, terms, of, filmmaking, came, in, 1969,, when, he, became, the, fifteenth, director, approached, to, do, a, film, version, of, Richard, Hooker's, novel, MASH,, from, a, script, by, former, blacklistee, (and, Oscar, winner), Ring, Lardner,, Jr.  (The, novel, itself, had, been, turned, down, by, about, 13, publishers.)  Altman's, eventual, movie,, which, mixed, slapstick, comedy, and, bloody, violence, indiscriminately, in, order, to, drive, home, its, message, of, the, pointlessness, of, war,, was, a, huge, hit.  Lardner, won, his, second, Oscar, (and, first, since, the, blacklist),, and, the, film, received, four, other, Oscar, nominations, at, the, 1970, Awards,, including, one, for, Altman, as, director.  It, also, won, the, Golden, Palm, at, Cannes,, a, Golden, Globe, for, Best, Musical/Comedy, Picture,, and, the, National, Society, of, Film, Critics', Best, Film, Award.  Altman, re-used, many, members, of, his, MASH, stock, company, for, his, next, two, films,, Brewster, McCloud, (1970), and, McCabe, &, Mrs., Miller, (1971),, the, latter, earning, Julie, Christie, her, second, Oscar, nomination.  But, although, these, and, several, of, Altman's, other, early-'70s, films, were, critically, praised,, Altman, did, not, strike, gold, again, until, 1975,, when, Nashville, was, released, to, almost, unaminous, critical, acclaim.  This, mosaic, of, interconnecting, lives, was, a, free-form, meditation, on, music,, politics,, fame,, women,, and, many, other, things.  Though, considered, by, many, to, be, the, archetypal, Great, American, Film,, it, lost, the, Best, Picture, Oscar, to, Milos, Forman's, One, Flew, Over, the, Cuckoo's, Nest.  (Sidney, Lumet's, excellent, Dog, Day, Afternoon, came, out, the, same, year,, as, did, Stanley, Kubrick's, Barry, Lyndon,, Steven, Spielberg's, Jaws,, and, Ken, Russell's, Tommy, -, what, a, year, for, movies!),  Altman,, however,, was, not, shut, out;, he, picked, up, two, more, Oscar, nomations, -, for, producing, and, directing, -, as, well, as, awards, from, the, National, Board, of, Review,, the, National, Society, of, Film, Critics,, and, the, New, York, Film, Critics, Circle. , Unfortunately,, this, creative, high, point, also, marked, a, downturn, in, Altman's, career.,  His, next, film,, Buffalo, Bill, and, the, Indians,, or, Sitting, Bull's, History, Lesson, (1976),, was, a, dud,, and, he, gradually, slipped, out, of, Hollywood, favor, after, a, string, of, critical, misfires, such, as, Quintet, (1979),, H.E.A.L.T.H., (1979),, Popeye, (1980),, and, his, segment, of, the, anthologized, opera, film, Aria, (1987).,  He, then, returned, to, television,, directing, a, praised, TV-movie, adaptation, of, Herman, Wouk's, play, The, Caine, Mutiny, Court-Martial, in, 1988.  The, same, year,, he, collaborated, with, Doonesbury, cartoonist, Garry, Trudeau, on, the, HBO, television, series, "Tanner, '88,", a, political, satire.  Altman, returned, to, filmmaking, with, a, vengeance, with, The, Player, (1992),, a, blistering, Hollywood, satire,, which, earned, him, his, fourth, Oscar, nomination.  He, picked, up, a, fifth, the, following, year, with, the, Raymond, Carver, adaptation, Short, Cuts, (1993).  In, recent, years,, Altman, has, also, acted, as, a, mentor, to, director, Alan, Rudolph,, producing, his, films, Mrs., Parker, and, the, Vicious, Circle, (1994),, Afterglow, (1997), -, which, earned, Julie, Christie, her, third, Oscar, nomination, -, and, Trixie, (2000).  At, the, age, of, 75,, Altman, is, still, going, strong.,      There, are, many, trademarks, which, mark, Altman's, work.  His, films, come, in, two, "flavors", -, "small", and, "large."  His, "small", films, are, often, intimate, character, studies,, such, as, Brewster, McCloud, or, Secret, Honor, (1984).  As, a, matter, of, fact,, the, latter,, an, unusual, film, by, anyone's, standards,, contains, exactly, one, character:, Richard, Nixon.  Philip, Baker, Hall,, who, plays, the, former, president,, essentially, delivers, an, extended, 85-minute, monologue.  At, the, other, end, of, the, spectrum,, Altman's, "large", films,, such, as, M*A*S*H, and, Nashville,, cover, a, much, more, sizable, canvas,, using, bigger-than-usual, ensemble, casts, that, play, off, of, each, other.  Much, of, the, dialogue, is, improvised,, since, Altman, wants, to, get, a, sense, of, how, the, characters, behave, in, everyday, life.  Plot, machinations, are, kept, to, a, minimum, -, the, flow, is, determined, by, the, ordinary, lives, of, the, characters.  A, typical, Altman, film, uses, long, tracking, shots,, overlapping, dialogue,, and, a, song-heavy, soundtrack.  Altman, watches, his, characters, with, a, Renoir-like, detachment, and, takes, a, similar, seemingly, non-judgemental, view, of, their, actions.  A, final, Altman, trademark, is, the, use, of, black, comedy, and, satire, to, make, his, points, about, human, nature,, as, well, as, such, human, institutions, as, the, military,, the, political, system,, the, music, industry,, and, Hollywood., Recommended, Films, M*A*S*H, (1970), Nashville, (1975)Other, Notable, Films, Brewster, McCloud, (1970), McCabe, &, Mrs., Miller, (1971), Images, (1972), The, Long, Goodbye, (1973),

on, June, 3,, 1922,, in, Vannes,, France. , In, 1947,, he, directed, a, series, of, short, biographical, documentaries, on, famous, artists.,  He, remade, one, of, these,, Van, Gogh,, the, following, year, under, the, same, title.,  This, Van, Gogh, won, its, screenwriters,, Gaston, Diehl, and, Robert, Hessens,, a, 1949, Oscar, for, Best, Short, Subject.  Resnais, first, gained, international, attention, for, his, 32-minute, documentary, about, the, Holocaust,, Night, and, Fog, (1955). , Resnais', first, feature, film,, Hiroshima,, mon, amour, (1959),, also, dealt, with, a, tragedy, related, to, World, War, II,, as, can, be, inferred, from, the, title.  This, film,, which, in, many, ways, revolutionized, the, art, of, cinema,, was, the, result, of, a, collaboration, between, Resnais, and, novelist, Marguerite, Duras,, and, earned, Duras, an, Oscar, nomination, for, Best, Original, Screenplay.  Resnais, followed, this, up, with, Last, Year, at, Marienbad, (1961),, a, similarly, groundbreaking, narrative, experiment,, which, earned, scenarist, Alain, Robbe-Grillet, an, Oscar, nomination.  Resnais', next, two, films,, Muriel, (1963), -, his, first, film, in, color, -, and, La, Guerre, est, finie, (1966),, were, similarly, complex, and, rewarding,, and, the, latter, earned, Jorge, Semprun, a, Best, Original, Screenplay, Oscar, nomination.  (Seeing, a, pattern, here?)  Stavisky..., (1974),, also, scripted, by, Semprun,, featured, one, of, Charles, Boyer's, last, performances,, one, of, Gerard, Depardieu's, first,, and, Stephen, Sondheim's, first, original, film, score. , Providence, (1977),, Resnais', first, film, in, English,, offered, John, Gielgud, one, of, his, few, leading, roles, in, film,, and, he, made, the, most, of, it,, winning, the, New, York, Film, Critics, Circle, Award, for, Best, Actor.  Mon, oncle, d'Amerique, (1980), used, the, stories, of, three, fictional, characters, to, demonstrate, the, psychological, theories, of, Henri, Laborit,, best, known, as, the, developer, of, Thorazine.  The, pattern, continued, at, the, Oscars,, as, Resnais, was, once, again, shut, out, while, screenwriter, Jean, Gruault, picked, up, a, nomination.  Gruault, and, Resnais, next, collaborated, on, Life, Is, a, Bed, of, Roses, (1983),, an, original, fable, that, once, again, used, parallel, storylines,, this, time, as, a, way, of, contrasting, the, past, and, present.  Resnais', subsequent, projects,, including, L'Amour, a, mort, (1984),, I, Want, to, Go, Home, (1989),, the, 5-hour, long, Smoking/No, Smoking, (1993),, and, the, musical, Same, Old, Song, (1997),, have, been, acclaimed, abroad,, but, they, have, not, been, able, to, find, much, distribution, in, the, United, States,, perhaps, because, they, are, considered, to, somewhat, less, "serious", works.,      Resnais', trademarks, as, a, director, include, a, preoccupation, with, the, past,, memory,, and, time.  His, films, often, deal, with, abstract, issues,, but, dramatize, them, in, recognizable, human, terms.,  His, films, are, formally, quite, complex,, and, use, nontraditional, nonlinear, narratives, -, usually,, though, not, always,, in, an, attempt, to, replicate, the, human, thought, process.,  (It, might, be, fair, to, say, that, what, Proust, attempted, to, do, with, the, novel,, Resnais, attempted, to, do, to, with, film.)  Additional, trademarks, of, Resnais, include, beautiful, cinematography, and, haunting, scores,, making, many, of, his, films, a, pleasure, for, the, senses, as, well, as, for, the, mind., Recommended, Films,

 His, parents, moved, back, to, their, home, country,, Poland,, in, the, late, 1930's. , If, you, saw, Schindler's, List, (1993),, you, saw, Roman's, childhood.  Although, his, mother, died, in, a, concentration, camp,, Roman, somehow, survived, and, found, his, only, escape, from, the, harsh, reality, of, the, war, at, various, local, cinemas.  After, the, war,, he, attended, technical, school, but, his, love, of, film, led, him, toward, a, career, in, acting.,  He, appeared, in, Andrej, Wajda's, seminal, postwar, film, A, Generation, (1955).,  The, same, year,, he, co-starred, in, his, own, short, film,, Bicycle. , He, made, several, more, early, short, films,, including, the, surrealistic, Two, Men, and, a, Wardrobe, (1958).  His, first, feature,, Knife, in, the, Water, (1962),, was, made, in, black-and-white, on, a, low, budget, with, only, three, actors.  (It, was, co-scripted, by, another, noted, Polish, director,, Jerzy, Skolimowski.) , Although, it, had, a, very, simple, story,, Knife, in, the, Water, displayed, Polanski's, fascination, with, unconvential, relationships, and, toyed, with, the, conventions, of, the, suspense, thriller, in, a, way, that, would, become, his, trademark.  It, was, an, international, success, and, put, Polanski, on, the, map, as, one, of, Poland's, most, noted, filmmakers.  He, promptly, left, for, France,, where, he, met, collaborator, Gerard, Brach.  The, two, of, them, teamed, up, with, New, Wavers, Jean-Luc, Godard, and, Claude, Chabrol, for, the, anthology, The, World's, Most, Beautiful, Swindlers, (1964). , Repulsion, (1965),, an, unsettling, horror, film, starring, Catherine, Deneuve, as, a, beautiful, virgin, driven, mad, by, the, combined, forces, of, urban, blight, and, sexual, repression,, was, the, pair's, next, collaboration,, and, Polanski's, first, film, in, English.  Then, they, did, Cul-de-sac, (1966),, a, blackly, comic, thriller, starring, the, sinister, British, actor, Donald, Pleasance, as, a, decidedly, non-sinister, henpecked, husband.  The, pair's, fourth, collaboration,, and, Polanski's, first, film, in, color,, was, the, horror-comedy, The, Fearless, Vampire, Killers, or:, Pardon, Me,, But, Your, Teeth, Are, in, My, Neck, (1967).,  This, one, starred, Jack, MacGowran, as, a, vampire, hunter, and, Polanski, as, his, bumbling, assistant,, Alfred.  Polanski, wanted, Jill, St., John, (who, would, later, play, the, Bond, girl, in, Diamonds, Are, Forever, [1971]), to, play, the, role, of, Sarah, Shagal,, but, executive, producer, Martin, Ransohoff, insisted, that, he, use, Ransohoff's, discovery,, a, young, actress, named, Sharon, Tate.  Polanski, and, Tate, fell, in, love, and, were, married, in, early, 1968.,      1968, also, marked, a, turning, point, in, Polanski's, career, -, he, received, his, first, Oscar, nomination, that, year,, for, the, now-classic, Rosemary's, Baby.  New, in, Hollywood,, Polanski, did, not, realize, how, many, liberties, the, purchase, of, a, property, allowed, him, to, take,, and, thus, his, Oscar-nominated, screenplay, hewed, extremely, closely, to, Ira, Levin's, popular, horror/suspense, novel.,  That, was, okay,, however,, since, Levin, was, an, extremely, good, storyteller,, and, Rosemary's, Baby, is,, next, to, A, Kiss, Before, Dying,, probably, his, best, work.,  1968, also, marked, Polanski's, return, to, acting, in, other, director's, films, -, he, took, a, cameo, role, in, Joseph, McGrath's, adaptation, of, Terry, Southern's, black-comic, satire,, The, Magic, Christian.,      1969, marked, another, turning, point, in, Polanski's, life,, and, one, that, was, not, nearly, as, happy.  Growing, up, in, Nazi-occupied, Poland,, young, Roman, must, have, faced, horrors, and, atrocities, every, day,, but, it, is, difficult, to, say, if, that, could, have, prepared, him, for, the, truly, horrific, event, that, took, place, in, the, early, morning, hours, of, August, 10,, 1969.  Sharon, Tate,, three, of, her, friends,, and, an, innocent, bystander, where, brutally, slaughtered, at, the, Polanskis', home, in, Beverly, Hills, by, followers, of, Charles, Manson.  (For, a, truly, chilling, account, of, the, incident,, visit, the, Crime, Library, on, the, Web.)  Polanski,, who, was, in, Europe, at, the, time, of, the, killings,, was, distraught, at, the, news,, and, his, grief, was, aggravated, by, the, popular, press,, which, mistakenly, tied, the, murders, to, the, presumed, drug-abusing, lifestyle, of, Tate,, Polanski,, and, their, friends.  (Although, Polanski, and, the, others, undoubtedly, experimented, with, drugs, -, it, was,, after, all, the, '60s, -, there, is, nothing, to, suggest, that, their, lifestyle, was, extremely, decadent, and, it, in, any, case,, it, was, most, certainly, not, the, cause, of, their, deaths.),      Humor, was, completely, absent, from, Polanski's, next, film, -, a, dark,, violent,, and, controversial, adaptation, of, Shakespeare's, Macbeth, (1971), which, was, co-scripted, by, noted, critic, Kenneth, Tynan.  By, 1973,, however,, he, seemed, to, have, come, around,, artistically.  He, reteamed, with, Brach, to, produce, the, X-rated, comedy, What?.  What?, is, generally, considered, one, of, Polanski's, few, failures,, but, he, followed, it, up, with, what, is, undoubtedly, his, masterpiece, -, Chinatown, (1974).  This, neo-noir, is, a, rare, example, of, several, talented, artists, -, Polanski,, writer, Robert, Towne,, cinematographer, John, A., Alonzo,, art, director, Dick, Sylbert,, composer, Jerry, Goldsmith,, and, performers, Jack, Nicholson,, Faye, Dunaway,, and, John, Huston, -, all, coming, together, while, at, the, top, of, their, respective, games. , The, result, is, one, of, the, few, unquestioned, masterpieces, of, American, cinema. , Polanski's, next, film,, The, Tenant, (1976),, was, a, return, to, contemporary, horror,, this, time, the, story, of, a, timid, man, (played, by, Polanski, himself), driven, mad, after, occupying, the, apartment, of, a, woman, who, attempted, suicide.  This, bizarrely, cast, French-language, film, (scripted, by, Brach, and, Polanski, from, Ronald, Topor's, novel), sharply, divided, audiences,, with, the, majority, hooting, at, a, story, that, they, found, far-fetched, and, scenes, -, like, the, one, where, Polanski, dresses, in, the, clothing, of, his, apartment's, previous, tenant, -, that, they, found, ridiculous.  Still,, the, critical, drubbing, was, nothing, compared, to, the, disaster, that, would, befall, Polanski, next.,      Ever, since, the, death, of, his, wife,, Polanski, had, been, trying, in, various, ways, to, find, sexual, fulfillment.,  One, day, in, 1977,, he, approached, the, 13-year-old, daughter, of, a, woman, he, had, befriended, and, asked, her, to, pose, for, some, photographs.  He, took, her, to, the, house, of, his, good, friend, Jack, Nicholson, (who, was, away, at, the, time),, where,, under, circumstances, that, are, not, entirely, clear,, they, had, sex.  Shortly, thereafter,, the, girl's, mother, pressed, charges, of, statutory, rape, against, Polanski.  Polanski, was, advised, to, plead, guilty,, but, the, judge, swore, to, put, him, away, for, many, years.  Justifiably, afraid, of, incarceration,, Polanski, fled, the, country,, assuming, French, citizenship. , To, this, day,, he, cannot, set, foot, on, American, soil, without, being, under, threat, of, arrest.,     Polanski's, next, project,, co-scripted, with, Brach, and, John, Brownjohn, and, produced, by, noted, French, director, Claude, Berri, (Jean, de, Florette, and, Manon, of, the, Spring, [both, 1986]),, was, an, English-language, adaptation, of, Thomas, Hardy's, novel, Tess, of, the, d'Urbervilles.  Clocking, in, at, nearly, three, hours,, Tess, (1979), won, Polanski, his, third, Oscar, nomination, (he, was, also, nominated, for, directing, Chinatown).  Unfortunately,, his, career, quickly, took, a, downturn, after, this, success.  Polanski, only, made, two, films, during, the, 1980's, -, the, mediocre, Pirates, (1986), and, Frantic, (1988).  Emmanuelle, Seigner,, who, played, a, featured, role, in, the, latter,, married, Polanski, in, 1989.  (She, is, well, over, 30, years, his, junior;, in, 1999, his, age, was, exactly, double, hers.)  In, Polanski's, next, film,, the, highly, personal, Bitter, Moon, (1992),, Seigner, was, cast, as, sexually, voracious, monster, who, cripples, her, husband, (Peter, Coyote), and, then, sets, her, sights, on, an, English, tourist, (Hugh, Grant).  Polanski's, next, film,, Death, and, the, Maiden, (1994),, was, a, generally, well-received, adaptation, of, Ariel, Dorfman's, supense, play/character, study.  Although, Polanski, remains, a, rather, non-productive, exile,, he, still,, at, the, age, of, 67,, remains, capable, of, produce, profoundly, unsettling, works, of, art.  He, also, continues, to, act.  In, the, past, decade,, he, has, appeared, in, Deran, Sarafian's, sloppy, Back, in, the, U.S.S.R., (1992),, Giuseppe, Tornatore's, maddening, A, Pure, Formality, (1994),, and, Michel, Blanc's, truly, odd, comedy, Dead, Tired, (1994).,      Polanski's, one, undeniable, strength, is, his, ability, to, create, an, atmosphere, that, is, always, both, genuinely, unsettling, and, completely, appropriate.  He, is, constantly, drawn, to, the, dark, side, of, human, nature,, as, evidenced, by, his, favorite, genres:, suspense,, horror,, and, mystery.  He, appears, extremely, interested, in, human, relationships,, especially, bizarre, ones, with, overtones, of, sadomasochism.  Yet, at, the, same, time,, all, of, his, films, are, marked, by, his, own, personal, brand, of, black, humor,, which, often, manages, to, increase, the, tension, rather, than, lighten, it.  The, fact, this, sense, of, humor, still, exists, is, a, tribute, to, a, man, who,, whatever, his, personal, failings, and, oddities,, has, suffered, much, more, over, the, course,

Pennsylvania.  Coming, from, a, stage, family,, he, made, his, stage, acting, debut, at, the, age, of, 4.  He, appeared, on, Broadway, as, a, child, actor, in, the, '30s, and, was, one, of, the, Dead, End, kids, in, the, original, production, of, Sidney, Kingsley's, social, drama, (which, was, later, made, into, a, film, starring, Humphrey, Bogart).  Lumet, also, did, a, bit, of, film, acting, as, a, youth,, appearing, in, the, film, One, Third, of, a, Nation, (1939).  He, first, rose, to, prominence, as, a, director, at, CBS, in, the, early, 1950's,, where, he, helmed, episodes, of, "Danger,", "You, Are, There,", and, "The, Alcoa, Hour." , His, first, feature, was, the, critically, acclaimed, Twelve, Angry, Men, (1957),, based, on, Reginald, Rose's, contrived, but, dramatically, effective, teleplay.  This, success, was, followed, in, 1958, by, two, made-for-TV, adaptations, of, famous, novels, -, Robert, Penn, Warren's, Pulitzer, Prize-winning, All, the, King's, Men, (already, filmed, by, Robert, Rossen, in, 1949), and, Alexandre, Dumas', classic, The, Count, of, Monte, Cristo.,  Lumet's, next, feature, was, an, unsuccesful, remake, of, Morning, Glory, (1933), called, Stage, Struck, (1958).  This, was, followed, by, another, remake:, The, Shopworn, Angel, (1928, and, again, in, 1938), as, That, Kind, of, Woman, (1959). , He, next, adapted, Tennesee, Williams', play, Orpheus, Descending, as, The, Fugitive, Kind, (1959).  1960, saw, two, television, films, -, Eugene, O'Neill's, The, Iceman, Cometh,, starring, Jason, Robards,, and, Michael, and, Fay, Kanin's, play, Rashomon,, based, on, the, same, stories, that, inspired, the, classic, 1950, Akira, Kurosawa, film.  In, 1961,, Lumet, transferred, Arthur, Miller's, play, A, View, from, the, Bridge, into, French,, making, Vu, du, pont, his, only, foreign-language, film.,  Lumet, finally, struck, dramatic, gold, in, 1962, when,, with, the, help, of, producer, Ely, Landau,, he, made, a, theatrical, version, of, Eugene, O'Neill's, landmark, drama, Long, Day's, Journey, Into, Night,, starring, Katherine, Hepburn,, Ralph, Richardson,, Jason, Robards, (repeating, his, role, from, the, original, Broadway, production),, and, Dean, Stockwell.,  This, black-and-white,, 3-hour-long,, almost, unbearably, stagy, production, somehow, manages, to, transcend, its, flaws, and, become, a, masterpiece.  Most, of, the, credit, for, this, goes, to, O'Neill,, but, Lumet, must, also, be, commended, for, not, messing, the, play, up.,     Long, Day's, Journey, was, Lumet's, last, big-name, adaptation, for, a, while.  His, next, project,, Fail-Safe, (1964),, was, a, serious, treatment, of, the, same, subject, matter, -, nuclear, war, -, that, Stanley, Kubrick, had, mocked, just, a, few, months, earlier, in, his, classic, Dr., Strangelove.  Lumet's, film, understandably, suffered, in, comparison.  The, Pawnbroker, (1965),, brought, Rod, Steiger, an, Oscar, nomination, for, his, role, as, a, Holocaust, survivor, in, the, first, of, many, gritty, dramas, Lumet, would, make, in, New, York, City.  The, Group, (1966),, based, on, Mary, McCarthy's, memoir,, was, Lumet's, second, film, in, color,, after, Stage, Struck.,  The, late, 1960's, were, a, rather, disappointing, period, for, Lumet,, but, his, career, picked, up, in, the, '70s, with, his, first, documentary,, King:, A, Filmed, Record..., Montgomery, to, Memphis, (1970).  This, film,, which, Lumet, co-directed, with, Hollywood, legend, Joe, Mankiewicz,, earned, producer, Landau, (who, also, founded, the, American, Film, Theater, project), an, Oscar, nomination, for, best, feature-length, documentary.  King, was, followed, by, the, commercially, successful, thriller, The, Anderson, Tapes, (1971).,  Serpico, (1973), teamed, Lumet, with, Al, Pacino, in, the, first, of, a, quartet, of, urban, dramas, examining, police, corruption, in, the, NYPD.  Next, came, a, big-budget, glossy, adaptation, of, Agatha, Christie's, immortal, whodunit, Murder, on, the, Orient, Express, (1974),, with, an, all-star, including, Ingrid, Bergman,, who, won, her, third, Oscar, for, her, role.,      Lumet's, second, masterpiece, (after, Long, Day's, Journey,, which, really, wasn't, his, work, anyway), came, out, in, 1975. , Dog, Day, Afternoon, starred, Al, Pacino, as, a, man, who, robs, a, bank, with, an, accomplice, (played, by, John, Cazale,, an, actor, who, was, woefully, underused, by, Hollywood, before, his, premature, and, unfortunate, death), in, order, to, pay, for, the, sex-change, operation, of, his, transsexual, lover, (Chris, Sarandon).  From, this, unlikely, plot, (based, on, a, true, story),, Lumet, created, a, hyperrealistic,, almost, unbearably, intense, film, which, manages, to, be, funny,, sad,, thought-provoking, and, heart-poundingly, suspenseful, -, all, without, once, dipping, into, the, sentimentality, that, Lumet, has, become, noted, for, avoiding.  All, in, all,, an, excellent, movie,, and, I, for, one, wish, that, Hollywood, had, at, the, very, least, adopted, a, few, of, Lumet's, realistic, tenets.,     , Lumet, followed, up, Dog, Day, with, the, enormously, overrated, Network, (1976).,  Paddy, Chayefsky, wrote, this, bizarre, right-wing, fable, about, the, television, industry, and, how, it, has, completely, eroded, the, ability, of, everyone, in, this, country, to, feel. , Everyone,, that, is,, but, Paddy, Chayefsky.  Chayefsky's, brand, of, right-wing, Judaism, did, not, mix, well, with, Lumet's, liberal, Judaism,, and, it, was, a, far-fetched,, overwritten,, and, pretentious, script, anyway.  So, says, me.  The, Academy, thought, differently,, voting, Chayefsky, his, third, (!), Oscar, and, giving, Lumet, his, third, nomination, (after, Twelve, Angry, Men, and, Dog, Day, Afternoon).  Lumet, also, won, his, only, Golden, Globe, to, date, for, Network,, although, he, lost, the, Oscar, to, John, G., Avildsen, for, Rocky.,      Next, for, Lumet, was, a, stagebound, adaptation, of, Peter, Shaffer's, play, Equus, (1977),, which, earned, stars, Richard, Burton, and, Peter, Firth, Oscar, nominations.  1978, saw, the, extremely, prolific, Lumet, direct, The, Wiz,, a, musical, version, of, The, Wizard, of, Oz, (1939), with, an, all-black, cast.  Lumet, adapted, Jay, Presson, Allen's, novel, Just, Tell, Me, What, You, Want, (1980), to, the, screen, next,, then, re-teamed, with, her, for, Prince, of, the, City, (1981),, based, on, the, true, story, of, an, NYPD, informer.  Prince, is, in, many, ways, a, mirror, image, of, Serpico,, also, a, true, story.  While, Serpico, is, the, one, honest, cop, among, numerous, corrupt, ones,, Danny, Ciello, (the, protagonist, of, Prince), is, a, corrupt, cop, himself,, and, the, reason, for, his, corruption, are, spelled, out, -, he, is,, to, some, extent,, justified.  Both, movies,, however,, deal, with, the, enormous, emotional, price, their, respective, protagonists, pay, when, they, decide, to, come, clean, and, talk, to, the, authorities,, thus, breaching, the, "code, of, silence", among, all, cops, in, the, department.  Both, films, feature, large, casts, with, many, standout, performances, in, supporting, roles, -, attention, to, supporting, players, and, the, ability, to, handle, large, ensembles, have, always, been, among, Lumet's, instinctive, strengths.,   Lumet, and, Allen, shared, an, Oscar, nomination, -, Lumet's, fourth, -, for, their, script.,      1982, saw, two, Lumet, films.  One, was, an, adaptation, of, Ira, Levin's, stage, play, Deathtrap,, which, bears, more, than, a, passing, resemblance, to, Sleuth,, the, hit, play, by, Peter, Shaffer's, twin, brother, Anthony, which, was, brought, to, the, screen, by, Lumet's, old, collaborator,, Joseph, L., Mankiewicz,, back, in, 1972.,  The, second, was, the, courtroom, drama, The, Verdict,, based, on, a, rather, far-fetched, script, by, the, enormously, overrated, playwright, David, Mamet, (who, was, adapting,, most, likely, badly,, Barry, Reed's, novel).  Despite, its, flaws,, The, Verdict, did, have, a, compelling, story, (the, most, compelling, one, of, all, -, the, story, of, redemption),, some, interesting, plot, twists,, and, a, crafty, supporting, performance, by, that, old, pro,, James, Mason.  The, Academy, went, to, town, on, this, one,, nominating, it, for, Best, Picture,, Best, Actor, (Paul, Newman),, Best, Supporting, Actor, (Mason),, Best, Director, (Lumet,, giving, him, a, total, of, 5, nominations, and, no, wins),, and, Best, Adapted, Screenplay, (Mamet).  Luckily,, when, it, came, to, actually, giving, out, the, awards,, the, Academy, recovered, its, senses, and, honored, a, much,, much,, much, better, film,, Richard, Attenborough's, Gandhi.,     Much, of, Lumet's, subsequent, work, has, been, overlooked. , Daniel, (1983), was, an, adaptation, of, E.L., Doctorow's, novel,, scripted, by, the, author, himself.  The, Morning, After, (1986), earned, Jane, Fonda, what, proved, to, be, her, final, Oscar, nomination.  Running, on, Empty, (1988),, which, earned, River, Phoenix, his, only, Oscar, nomination, before, his, untimely, death,, was, something, of, a, return, to, form,, earning, Lumet, his, fifth, Golden, Globe, nomination.  Q, &, A, (1990), and, Night, Falls, on, Manhattan, (1997), completed, Lumet's, quartet, of, NYPD, dramas.  His, most, recent, film,, Gloria,, was, a, generally, badly, received, remake, of, the, 1980, John, Cassavetes, film.  Upcoming, projects, include, The, Beautiful, Mrs., Seidenmann,, the, story, of, a, woman, trying, to, survive, the, Holocaust,, and, Whistle,, a, David, Mamet-scripted, adaptation, of, the, James, Jones, novel. , Whistle, is, the, concluding, part, of, Jones's, World, War, II, trilogy,, which, is, comprised, of, it,, From, Here, to, Eternity, and, The, Thin, Red, Line.  The, other, two, have, both, been, successfully, filmed:, the, former, by, Fred, Zinnemann, in, 1953, and, the, latter, by, Terrence, Malick, in, 1998.  It, remains, to, be, seen, whether, Lumet, can, complete, the, hat, trick,, but, with, Mamet, doing, the, script,, I'm, afraid, the, prognosis, is, not, good.,      Although, Lumet's, work, is, extremely, varied,, there, are, a, few, broad, categories, that, his, projects, can, be, grouped, into.  The, Tennesee, Williams, and, Eugene, O'Neill, adaptations, are, one, such, category.  The, urban, NYC, dramas, are, another.  Still, another, category, would, be, the, "just-for-fun", projects, like, The, Wiz,, Murder, on, the, Orient, Express,, and, The, Anderson, Tapes.,  In, addition,, certain, thematic, strains, often, appear, in, Lumet's, work. , Fail-Safe,, The, Pawnbroker,, and, Network, all, deal, with, dehumanization, and, the, ability, (or, lack, thereof), to, feel.  Long, Day's, Journey,, Daniel,, and, Running, on, Empty, all, deal, with, families, in, torment, and, the, idea, that, the, deeds, of, parents, are, visited, upon, their, children.  And,, of, course,, many, of, Lumet's, films, deal, with, justice,, law, enforcement,, and, the, judicial, system. One, final, note:, special, mention, must, be, made, of, Lumet's, 1995, book,, Making, Movies. , This, book, is, an, invaluable, guide, to, filmmaking, techniques,, and, it, also, offers, several, valuable, insights, into, Lumet's, work, and, personality., Recommended,

Frankenheimer,     John, Frankenheimer, was, born, on, February, 19,, 1930,, in, New, York, City. , Like, Sidney, Lumet,, he, got, his, start, as, a, live, television, director, at, CBS, in, the, 1950's, -, in, fact,, both, he, and, Lumet, worked, on, the, television, series, "Danger", and, "You, Are, There."  Frankenheimer, also, directed, episodes, of, "Playhouse, 90", and, "Climax!,", receiving, an, Emmy, nomination, for, an, episode, of, the, latter, entitled, "Portrait, in, Celluloid.",  His, first, feature, film, was, The, Young, Stranger, (1957),, a, sincere, drama, about, juvenile, delinquency. , (Frankenheimer, would, return, to, social, themes, in, many, future, projects.)  Frankheimer, was, not, pleased, with, the, result,, as, he, was, unused, to, working, with, just, one, camera.  He, would, gladly, have, remained, in, live, television,, but, the, field, itself, ceased, to, exist, in, the, 1960's.  So, he, returned, to, feature, filmmaking, with, The, Young, Savages, (1961),, starring, Burt, Lancaster, as, an, idealistic, district, attorney, who, investigates, a, racially-charged, gang-related, slaying.  The, Young, Savages, began, a, cycle, of, highly-praised, black, and, white, dramas, that, Frankenheimer, would, direct, in, the, 1960's.  The, next, was, William, Inge's, follow-up, to, Splendor, in, the, Grass, (1961),, All, Fall, Down, (1962),, which, was, a, family, drama, starring, Eva, Marie, Saint, and, Warren, Beatty.  1962, also, saw, two, other, Frankheimer, movies,, both, of, which, would, become, enduring, classics.  Birdman, of, Alcatraz, starred, Burt, Lancaster, in, the, title, role,, and, earned, Oscar, nominations, for, him, and, co-stars, Thelma, Ritter, and, Telly, Savalas, (the, latter, had, previously, worked, with, Frankenheimer, and, Lancaster, in, Young, Savages).  However,, it, is, the, other, 1962, film,, The, Manchurian, Candidate,, on, which, Frankenheimer's, current, popular, reputation, almost, entirely, rests.,      The, Manchurian, Candidate,, which, was, based, on, a, novel, by, Richard, Condon,, works, on, many, levels.  On, one, level,, it, is, a, surrealistic, Cold, War, thriller, which, is, extremely, suspenseful.  On, another, level,, it, is, a, brittle, social, commentary, which, satirizes, McCarthyism, (something, which, was, taken, extremely, seriously, at, the, time).  On, yet, another, level,, it, is, a, parable, of, dehumanization.  And, so, on.  It, also, features, complex,, well-drawn, characters, and, a, Golden-Globe, winning, performance, by, Angela, Lansbury,, who, had, previously, worked, with, Frankenheimer, in, All, Fall, Down.  Because, Manchurian, Candidate, dealt, with, political, assassination,, and, because, it, had, the, bad, luck, to, be, released, around, the, time, of, the, actual, assassination, of, John, F., Kennedy,, it, was, quickly, withdrawn, from, circulation, by, star, and, co-producer, Frank, Sinatra, (a, personal, friend, of, JFK).  When, it, was, released, 25, years, later,, it, was, hailed, as, a, long-lost, classic,, causing, screenwriter, George, Axelrod, to, remark,, "The, Manchurian, Candidate, is, the, only, film, to, go, from, being, a, flop, to, being, a, classic, without, ever, having, been, a, hit, in, between.",      Frankenheimer, followed, this, creative, and, artistic,, if, not, commercial,, success, with, Seven, Days, in, May,, another, political, thriller, and, his, third, collaboration, with, Lancaster.  This, film,, which, was, scripted, by, "The, Twilight, Zone", creator, Rod, Serling,, earned, Frankenheimer, his, only, Golden, Globe, nomination, (he, has, never, been, nominated, for, an, Oscar).  Frankenheimer, and, Lancaster, teamed, up, again, for, The, Train, (1964),, a, World, War, II, action, picture, with, an, unusual, theme.  Lancaster, and, Albert, Remy, (Antoine, Doinel's, father, in, The, Four, Hundred, Blows, [1959]), play, French, resistance, fighters, who, are, trying, to, protect, a, shipment, of, valuable, French, art, from, being, shipped, to, Germany, by, a, Nazi, officer, (brilliantly, portrayed, by, Paul, Scofield), at, the, tail, end, of, the, war.  While, it, is, for, the, most, part, a, routine, (if, well-made), action, film,, The, Train, is, distinguished, by, its, incredible, closing, sequence,, which, critic, Stanley, J., Solomon, called, "the, equivalent, of, ending, a, sentence, with, five, exclamation, marks", in, its, emphatic, effect.  After, having, sat, through, two, hours, of, typical, action-movie, sentiments, and, heroics, (albeit, filtered, through, Frankenheimer's, unique, artistic, sensibility),, the, audience, is, sent, out, of, the, theater, with, some, serious, and, profound, thoughts, on, the, nature, of, art, and, its, value, in, a, society, that,, for, the, most, part,, no, longer, appreciates, it.,      Frankenheimer, made, two, films, in, 1966.  One, of, them,, Seconds,, was, a, haunting, study, of, identity, featuring, John, Randolph, as, a, middle-aged, man, who, is, given, a, chance, to, reinvent, himself, as, Rock, Hudson.  The, brilliant, camerawork, of, legendary, Chinese, cinematographer, James, Wong, Howe, was, a, standout, feature, of, this, film,, which,, like, The, Manchurian, Candidate,, was, a, commercial, failure, upon, release, but, has, since, been, hailed, as, a, classic.  Unfortunately,, Frankenheimer's, other, 1966, film,, Grand, Prix, (his, first, film, in, color),, marked, the, beginning, of, a, downturn, in, his, career.  Although, the, film, won, 3, technical, Oscars, and, featured, exciting, and, well-done, scenes, involving, Formula, 1, car, racing,, the, human, characters, and, their, interactions, were, generally, considered, to, be, uninteresting.  Frankenheimer's, next, two, films,, The, Fixer, (1968), and, The, Gypsy, Moths, (1969),, were, conscious, attempts, to, get, away, from, the, action, genre,, but, the, former, -, a, Dalton, Trumbo-scripted, adaptation, of, Bernard, Malamud's, classic, novel, -, was, generally, considered, to, have, little, going, for, it, other, than, Alan, Bates's, Oscar-nominated, lead, performance,, while, the, latter,, despite, well-filmed, skydiving, scenes, and, an, evocative, portrayal, of, small-town, life,, had, a, plot, that, was, strictly, soap-opera.  A, series, of, mediocre, films, -, as, well, as, the, bomb, The, Extraordinary, Seaman, (1969), -, followed.  Frankenheimer, seemed, to, get, back, on, track, with, a, 1973, adaptation, of, Eugene, O'Neill's, The, Iceman, Cometh,, produced, by, Ely, Landau, for, the, American, Film, Theater, project,, but, this, was, immediately, followed, by, his, career, nadir,, 99, and, 44/100%, Dead, (1974),, and, then, a, 1975, sequel, to, William, Friedkin's, overrated, Oscar-winner, The, French, Connection, (1971),, which, suffered, critically, by, comparison, to, the, original.,      In, 1957,, Robert, Evans, was, cast, as, legendary, MGM, executive, Irving, Thalberg, in, the, Lon, Chaney, biopic, Man, of, a, Thousand, Faces,, starring, James, Cagney.  A, decade, later,, he, found, himself, a, movie, mogul, in, real, life,, having, been, named, head, of, production, at, Paramount.  While, there,, he, oversaw, production, of,, among, others,, Roman, Polanski's, Rosemary's, Baby, (1968),, Arthur, Hiller's, Love, Story, (1970),, and, Francis, Ford, Coppola's, The, Godfather, (1972).  In, 1974,, he, struck, out, as, an, independent, producer,, and, promptly, hit, pay, dirt, with, Polanski's, Chinatown,, earning, himself, an, Oscar, nomination.  He, followed, this, up, with, John, Schlesinger's, suspense, thriller, Marathon, Man, (1976),, a, commercial, hit, starring, Dustin, Hoffman, as, a, Jewish, college, student, and, Laurence, Olivier, as, his, nemesis,, a, sadistic, Nazi, dentist.  Now,, looking, for, a, follow-up,, he, decided, to, turn, to, a, man, who, was, known, for, his, skill, in, directing, both, actors, and, action:, John, Frankenheimer.  The, result, of, their, collaboration, was, Black, Sunday, (1977),, based, on, the, first, novel, of, Thomas, Harris,, who, would, later, author, the, Hannibal, Lecter, trilogy, (Red, Dragon,, The, Silence, of, the, Lambs,, and, Hannibal,, all, of, which, have, been, made, into, movies).  Evans, pulled, out, all, the, stops, on, the, film,, hiring, as, screenwriters, Oscar, nominee, Ivan, Moffat, (Giant, [1956]),, playwright, Kenneth, Ross, (Breaker, Morant, and, the, screenplay, of, Fred, Zinnemann's, The, Day, of, the, Jackal, [1973]),, and, top, Hollywood, writer-producer, Ernest, Lehman,, whose, credits, include, such, classic, movie, musicals, as, Walter, Lang's, The, King, and, I, (1956),, Robert, Wise's, West, Side, Story, (1961),, Wise's, The, Sound, of, Music, (1965),, and, Gene, Kelly's, Hello,, Dolly, (1969),, as, well, as, such, classic, non-musical, films, as, Wise's, Executive, Suite, (1954),, Billy, Wilder's, Sabrina, (1954),, Alexander, Mackendrick's, Sweet, Smell, of, Success, (1957), (based, on, his, own, play),, Mike, Nichols', ground-breaking, Who's, Afraid, of, Virginia, Woolf?, (1966), (based, on, the, Pulitzer-Prize, winning, play, by, Edward, Albee),, and, Alfred, Hitchcock's, North, by, Northwest, (1959), and, Family, Plot, (1976).,      In, addition, to, the, writing, and, directing, talent, and, international, cast, (led, by, Robert, Shaw,, Bruce, Dern,, and, Marthe, Keller, [Marathon, Man's, female, lead]),, Evans, secured, one, more, major, coup.  For, the, film's, final, sequence,, a, terrorist, attack, on, the, Super, Bowl,, he, was, able, to, secure, permission, to, photograph, Shaw, at, the, sidelines, of, Super, Bowl, X, in, Miami,, and, to, use, the, bowl, game's, players,, commentators,, cheerleaders,, and, audience, as, extras.  The, result, is, one, of, the, most, exciting,, suspenseful,, and, above, all, else, realistic, action, sequences, ever, filmed.  Frankenheimer's, masterful, blending, of, reality, and, fiction, is, rivaled, by, only, one, other, Hollywood, film:, Haskell, Wexler's, Medium, Cool, (1969).  Frankenheimer,, however,, did, not, have, to, deal, with, the, production, and, budgetary, constrainst's, that, Wexler's, film, did,, and, thus, his, film, is, unique, among, non-independent, studio, productions.  Not, only, that,, but, it, is, remarkable, for, being, able, to, squeeze, a, remarkable, amount, of, political, commentary, into, its, subtext.  While, its, hero, is, Israeli, and, its, villains, Palestinian,, the, film, subtly, critiques, Israeli, policy, toward, the, Palestinian, minority, in, its, midst.  Also,, by, presenting, a, strong,, intelligent,, dedicated, female, character, who, is, nevertheless, a, villain,, the, film, attacks, both, the, patriarchical, view, of, women, held, by, reactionary, conservatives, and, the, angelic, view, of, them, taken, by, modern, radical, feminists.  In, addition,, through, the, use, of, the, Goodyear, blimp, to, symbolize, commercialization, and, Jimmy, Carter, to, symbolize, ..., Jimmy, Carter, (not, terribly, subtle,, I, know), the, film, manages, to, comment, obliquely, on, the, state, of, American, capitalism, and, politics.  It, also, takes, the, time, to, develop, its, characters, to, an, extent, that, most, of, today's, action, films, would, never, dream.  The, sympathetic, villain, played, by, Dern,, who, was, driven, mad,, emasculated,, and, essentially, destroyed, by, his, experience, fighting, in, Vietnam,, is, a, sad, reminder, of, the, price, that, we, continue, to, pay, for, that, conflict.,      The, roller, coaster, that, is, Frankenheimer's, career, took, another, dive, with, his, next, film,, the, horror, film, Prophecy, (1979).  It, stayed, down, for, about, 15, more, years,, although, 52, Pick-Up, (1986),, based, on, a, novel, by, Elmore, Leonard, (Get, Shorty,, Out, of, Sight,, and, the, book, that, became, Quentin, Tarantino's, film, Jackie, Brown, [1997]), did, receive, limited, acclaim, in, some, quarters.  But, in, the, end, it, would, be,, fittingly, enough,, Frankenheimer's, old, home, of, television, that, would, end, up, rejuvenating, his, career.  His, first, return, to, the, medium, came, in, 1982, with, an, TV-movie, adaptation, of, N., Richard, Nash's, play, The, Rainmaker,, starring, Tommy, Lee, Jones, and, Tuesday, Weld.  (The, play, had, previously, been, filmed, in, 1956, by, Joseph, Anthony,, with, Burt, Lancaster, and, Katherine, Hepburn, in, the, lead, roles.)  This, was, Frankenheimer's, first, TV, movie, since, an, adaptation, of, Terence, Rattigan's, play, The, Browning, Version, in, 1959,, starring, John, Gielgud.  Frankenheimer's, next, TV, movie, was, Riviera, (1987),, which, ended, up, being, so, distorted, from, his, original, intention, that, he, had, his, name, removed, from, it, and, replaced, with, the, ubiquitous, "Alan, Smithee", pseudonym.  But, after, the, commercial, and, critical, failure, of, the, theatrical, film, Year, of, the, Gun, (1991),, Frankenheimer, found, himself, contemplating,, as, much, as, he, dreaded, the, prospect,, early, retirement.  It, was, at, this, point, that, he, met, Robert, Cooper,, who, worked, for, the, cable, channel, HBO, and, offered, him, a, chance, to, direct, a, made-for-TV, movie, called, Against, the, Wall,, about, the, 1971, uprising, and, subsequent, riot, in, Attica, prison.  The, 1994, telefilm,, which, earned, Samuel, L., Jackson, a, Golden, Globe, nomination,, was, followed, by, another, movie, for, HBO,, The, Burning, Season, (1994).  This, movie,, which, starred, Raul, Julia, in, the, true, story, of, assassinated, Brazilian, activist, Chico, Mendes,, earned, 6, Emmy, nominations,, including, 2, for, Frankenheimer.  Frankenheimer, ended, up, winning, his, first, ever, Emmy, for, The, Burning, Season, (Julia, won, also),, and, he, followed, this, up, with, back-to-back, Emmys, for, his, next, two, TV, projects,, Andersonville, (1996), and, George, Wallace,, both, of, which, were, miniseries, made, for, the, cable, channel, TNT.  (He, was, also, nominated, for, Emmys, for, producing, all, three, films.)  Unfortunately,, it, was, also, during, this, time, that, he, was, tapped, by, New, Line, Cinema, to, take, over, The, Island, of, Dr., Moreau, (1996),, an, adaptation, of, the, H.G., Wells, novel, starring, a, reclusive, and, corpulent, Marlon, Brando.  This, film, was, a, negative, experience, for, all, involved,, and, Frankenheimer, refuses, to, talk, about, it, in, interviews.  His, next, two, theatrical, films,, Ronin, (1998), and, Reindeer, Games, (2000),, were, not, outstanding, successes,, but, both, did, receive, some, good, reviews.  Despite, the, jibes, of, those, who, refer, to, him, as, "the, former, John, Frankenheimer,", it, is, certain, that, John, Frankenheimer, will, still, be, making, films, until, he, is, "the, late, John, Frankenheimer.",      Of, Frankenheimer's, trademarks,, one, of, the, ones, that, stand, out, the, most, is, his, deep, commitment, to, social, issues.  Nearly, all, of, his, films, have, some, sort, of, sociocultural, subtext,, even, if, they, are, not, overtly, social, or, political, in, subject, matter.  But, this, recurrence, appears, to, be, intuitive.  When, it, comes, to, selecting, material,, Frankheimer, looks, for,, above, all, else,, "a, good, story,, really, good, characters,, and, serious, subject, matter", (his, words,, from, an, interview, which, can, be, found, here).  These, elements, have, marked, all, of, his, best, work,, while, his, lesser, work, can, often, be, chalked, up, to, the, failure, of, a, writer, to, provide, him, with, a, story, or, characters, capable, of, carrying, a, film.  Nevertheless,, his, output, has, been, quite, uneven,, due, in, large, part, to, the, projects, he, has, had, to, do, hack, work, on, during, his, lean, periods.  Frankenheimer, is, a, man, who, loves, filmmaking,, and, he, cannot, bear, to, not, do, it,, even, if, it, means, producing, bad, films.  But, in, spite, of, this, and, the, fact, that, he, has, been, unjustly, overlooked, by, the, Academy, (he, and, Resnais, are, the, only, directors, on, this, list, who, have, never, been, Oscar-nominated,, and, he,, unlike, Resnais,, is, not, foreign),, he, can, in, many, ways, be, called, the, American, Master, of, Suspense,, just, as, Hitchcock, was, the, British, one.  Like, Hitchcock,, he, has, been, able, to, use, lowbrow, genres, -, the, big-budget, action, film,, the, suspense, thriller, -, to, explore, important, social, and, personal, themes,, while, at, the, same, time, delivering, entertaining, stories, filled, with, excellent, acting,, colorful, characters,, and, plausible, situations.  And, that, is, why, he, deserves, to, stand, at, the, top, of, this, list., Recommended,
