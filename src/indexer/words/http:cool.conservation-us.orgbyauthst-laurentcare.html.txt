[The, Care, and, Handling, of, Recorded, Sound, Materials, By, Gilles, St-Laurent, Music, Division, National, Library, Of, Canada, January, 1996, La, version, francaise, An, earlier, version, of, this, report, was, published, by, the, Commission, on, Preservation, and, Access, Sound, recordings, are, machine, readable, artifacts;, they, are, documents, for, which, the, integrity, of, the, information, they, contain, is, directly, related, to, the, artifacts', physical, well, being., Since, the, majority, of, sound, recordings, are, made, of, plastic,, conservation, must, be, treated, as, a, plastics, degradation, problem,, requiring, a, different, approach, than, paper, conservation., It, is, important, to, understand, the, basic, chemical, degenerative, processes, and, the, principles, of, the, retention, of, sound, by, the, various, media, in, order, to, ensure, that, proper, action, is, taken, to, slow, the, rate, of, degradation., SOUND, AND, HEARING, Sound, can, be, defined, as, the, change, in, air, pressure, above, and, below, an, equilibrium, (usually, the, barometric, pressure)., For, example,, when, a, bass, drum, is, struck,, the, skin, vibrates, back, and, forth., As, the, skin, travels, outwards,, away, from, the, centre, of, the, drum,, the, air, pressure, surrounding, the, drum, rises, above, the, barometric, pressure;, conversely, as, the, drum, skin, travels, inwards,, the, air, pressure, lowers., This, to-and-fro, action, occurs, numerous, times, per, second, creating, waves, of, compression, and, decompression, in, surrounding, air., As, air, pressure, increases, by, the, outward, motion, of, the, bass, drum, skin,, the, eardrum, is, pushed, towards, the, centre, of, the, head;, conversely,, as, pressure, decreases,, the, eardrum, travels, away, from, the, center, of, the, head., Therefore,, the, eardrum, physically, moves, in, a, parallel, motion, to, the, movement, of, the, vibrating, bass, drum, skin., The, inner, ear, converts, the, change, in, air, pressure, into, sound, by, translating, the, eardrum's, mechanical, motions, into, impulses, that, the, brain, will, perceive, as, sound., The, ear, can, detect, changes, in, air, pressure, as, slow, as, 20, cycles, per, second, (a, cycle, being, a, complete, to-and-fro, motion), to, as, fast, as, 20,000, cycles, per, second., The, higher, the, vibration, speed,, the, higher, the, pitch;, the, larger, the, change, in, air, pressure,, the, louder, the, sound., THE, RECORDING,, RETENTION, AND, PLAYBACK, OF, SOUND, The, Microphone, The, interior, of, a, microphone, is, comprised, of, a, permanent, magnet,, a, coil, of, wire, and, a, diaphragm, which,, like, the, eardrum,, vibrates, to, changes, in, air, pressure., The, vibration, of, the, diaphragm, in, conjunction, with, the, permanent, magnet, and, the, coil, converts, changes, in, air, pressure, into, changes, in, electrical, voltage., As, air, pressure, increases,, the, diaphragm, within, the, microphone, is, pushed, towards, the, back, of, the, microphone,, inducing, a, voltage;, as, pressure, decreases,, the, diaphragm, travels, outwards, inducing, a, voltage, in, the, opposite, direction., Like, the, eardrum,, the, diaphragm, will, move, in, a, parallel, motion, to, the, movement, of, the, example, sound,, the, vibrating, bass, drum, skin., The, resulting, voltage, will, be, a, continuous, parallel, voltage, image, of, the, movement, of, that, bass, drum, skin., If, the, bass, drum, were, to, be, tuned, at, a, higher, pitch, (the, skin, tightened), the, skin, would, vibrate, faster,, causing, the, air, pressure, to, compress, and, decompress, faster,, meaning, that, the, diaphragm, within, the, microphone, will, vibrate, faster,, consequently, forcing, the, induced, voltage, to, change, direction, more, frequently., A, higher, pitch, will, thus, be, captured, on, the, recording, medium., If, the, drum, were, to, be, struck, harder,, producing, a, louder, sound,, the, skin, vibration, would, travel, a, greater, distance,, creating, a, higher, compression, of, air,, consequently, forcing, the, microphone, diaphragm, to, travel, a, greater, distance, thus, inducing, a, larger, voltage., The, recording, would, thus, be, at, a, higher, volume., This, chain, of, events, occurs, with, the, recording, of, any, sound., If, an, orchestra, were, to, be, recorded,, the, collective, air, pressure, change, surrounding, the, orchestra, (caused, by, the, mixture, of, vibrating, strings,, reeds,, etc.), would, be, captured, by, the, microphone., The, Speaker, Once, sound, has, been, converted, to, an, electrical, voltage,, the, "voltage, image", can, be, amplified, and, then, used, to, drive, speakers., Like, the, skin, of, the, bass, drum,, the, movement, of, the, speaker, compresses, and, decompresses, air, to, produce, sound., If, the, voltage, is, going, upwards,, the, speaker, will, travel, outwards;, if, the, voltage, is, going, downwards,, the, speaker, will, travel, inwards., The, resulting, movement, of, the, speaker, will, be, parallel, to, the, movement, of, the, skin, on, the, bass, drum,, to, the, movement, of, an, eardrum,, to, the, movement, of, the, diaphragm, within, the, microphone,, and, to, the, induced, voltage., Discs, All, grooved, discs, physically, retain, information, in, the, same, fashion, and, are, recorded, in, a, similar, manner., Just, as, a, speaker, converts, a, change, of, voltage, to, a, parallel, mechanical, motion,, so, with, discs, a, cutting, stylus, converts, a, voltage, change, to, a, mechanical, motion., When, the, voltage, applied, to, the, cutting, stylus, goes, up,, the, stylus, will, move, in, one, direction;, when, the, voltage, goes, down,, the, cutting, stylus, will, move, in, the, opposite, direction., The, movement, of, the, cutting, stylus, determines, the, pattern, of, the, groove, which,, of, course,, moves, in, a, parallel, motion, to, the, movement, of, the, bass, drum., Again,, the, resulting, groove, shape, will, be, a, continuous,, identical, physical, image, of, the, movement, of, that, bass, drum, skin., (Acoustic, recordings,, (made, prior, to, the, use, of, microphones,, ca., 1925),, recorded, sound, by, capturing, and, channeling, changes, of, air, pressure, through, a, horn, to, a, diaphragm, mounted, with, a, cutting, stylus., The, diaphragm, would, transform, the, changes, of, air, pressure, into, a, parallel, mechanical, motion, with, the, cutting, stylus, etching, the, groove.), To, retrieve, information, from, a, disc,, a, stylus, is, used, to, track, the, groove., The, cartridge, will, convert, the, movement, of, the, stylus, to, an, electrical, voltage, (in, the, same, fashion, that, a, microphone, converts, mechanical, motions, to, an, electrical, voltage), that, can, then, be, amplified, and, used, to, drive, speakers., The, movement, of, the, speaker, will, be, parallel, to, the, movement, of, the, stylus., Tapes, The, binder, layer, of, magnetic, tape, contains, a, finite, number, of, ferromagnetic, particles, whose, permanent, alignment, within, the, binder, records, voltage, (current), levels., To, record, onto, tape,, the, tape, must, first, pass, an, erase, head, whose, task, is, to, arrange, the, particles, completely, randomly., If, a, small, voltage, is, applied, to, the, record, head,, then, a, small, percentage, of, particles, will, become, unidirectionally, aligned., If, a, larger, voltage, is, applied, to, the, record, head,, then, a, larger, percentage, of, particles, will, become, aligned., Saturation, occurs, when, there, are, no, more, particles, available, to, align., The, particles, will, remain, aligned, until, exposed, to, a, magnetic, force., At, playback,, the, aligned, particles, will, induce, a, voltage, in, the, playback, head., The, voltage, level, will, be, proportional, to, the, number, of, aligned, particles., Compact, Discs, (CDs), Tapes, and, grooved, discs, are, analog, recordings--the, term, "analog", referring, to, the, transformation, of, sound, into, "parallel",, or, analogous, grooves, or, particle, alignments., Compact, Discs, on, the, other, hand,, are, "digital", recordings, (as, are, Digital, Audio, Tapes, (DAT),, Digital, Compact, Cassettes, (DCC),, Mini, Disc,, etc.)., Rather, than, being, a, continuous, physical, image, of, changes, in, electrical, voltage,, digital, recordings, are, based, on, a, series, of, discrete, electrical, voltage, measurements., For, the, CD,, the, electrical, voltage, (produced, by, the, microphone), is, measured, 44,100, times, per, second., At, a, certain, period, in, time, the, voltage, might, be, (for, argument's, sake), .5, volts, out, of, a, maximum, 1, volt., 1/44,100th, of, a, second, later, the, voltage, might, be, .5005, volts,, the, following, 1/44,100th, of, a, second, .5009, volts,, etc., As, the, skin, of, the, bass, drum, travels, outwards,, the, resulting, series, of, voltage, readings, get, progressively, larger;, as, the, skin, moves, inwards,, the, resulting, series, get, progressively, smaller., Just, as, 2:00, p.m., can, be, expressed, as, 14:00, hrs,, so, any, value, can, be, expressed, using, binary, digits--1s, and, 0s., Also,, 1/3, can, be, expressed, to, .3,, or, more, accurately, .33,, or, better, yet, .333, etc., The, greater, the, number, of, decimal, places,, the, more, precise, the, expression, of, the, translation;, hence, the, larger, the, number, of, digital, bits, used, in, a, number,, the, more, accurate, the, translation., For, the, compact, disc,, the, number, of, digital, bits, used, to, translate, or, "digitize", a, voltage, reading, is, 16., Thus, the, compact, disc, stores, one, 16, bit, number, (in, addition, to, other, required, information), every, 44,100th, of, a, second, (per, audio, channel)., The, CD, sound, recording, stores, information, using, pits, and, flat, areas, wound, in, a, spiral, starting, at, the, center, of, the, disc., The, edge, of, a, pit, (either, the, ascending, edge, or, descending, edge), indicates, a, one,, a, flat, area, either, at, the, bottom, of, the, pit, or, the, land, between, the, pits, indicates, 0., For, example,, a, 5, bit, number, of, 10001,, using, pits,, would, be, an, edge,, a, long, flat, area, and, another, edge., To, play, a, CD,, a, laser, beam, is, shone, through, the, clear, polycarbonate, bottom, to, the, aluminum, (sometimes, gold), layer., The, light, then, reflects, off, the, reflective, surface, to, a, pickup, which, differentiates, between, the, top, and, bottom, of, a, pit, and, interprets, these, as, 1s, or, 0s., The, electronics, then, build, a, continuous, voltage, from, these, series, of, stored, binary, numbers, representing, the, original, voltage, readings., THE, DEGRADATION, MECHANISMS, OF, SOUND, RECORDING, The, lifespan, of, a, plastic, is, largely, determined, at, the, manufacturing, stage., Variables, such, as, basic, resin,, the, materials, added, to, the, basic, resin, to, alter, its, properties,, the, lamination, of, materials, with, dissimilar, properties,, and, the, manufacturing, process, itself,, all, directly, affect, the, lifespan, of, the, plastic., Post-manufacture, environmental, factors, such, as, storage, conditions,, temperature,, humidity,, and, handling, also, contribute, to, the, long-term, stability, of, the, plastics., Plastics, can, be, divided, into, two, main, classes,, thermoplastic, and, thermosetting., Thermoplastics, soften, and, flow, when, heated, and, are, normally, shaped, by, heat, and, pressure., They, will, soften, and, flow, again, when, re-heated., Vinyl,, used, in, the, manufacturing, of, LP's,, is, a, thermoplastic., Thermosetting, plastics, are, moulded, under, heat, and, pressure., A, chemical, reaction, occurs, so, that, once, molded, they, do, not, soften, when, re-heated, and, will, normally, char, before, melting., Most, 78s, are, made, of, thermosetting, plastics., Acetate, Discs, Prior, to, the, advent, of, magnetic, tape,, instantaneous, recordings, were, made, chiefly, on, acetate, discs., The, chemical, makeup, of, these, discs,, therefore,, had, to, be, a, compromise, between, ease, of, engraving, and, the, quality, of, the, recording, that, resulted., Since, the, 1930s,, most, blank, acetate, discs, have, been, manufactured, with, a, base,, usually, aluminum, (although, glass, was, used, during, the, war, years, and, cardboard, for, inexpensive, home, recordings),, that, was, coated, with, nitrocellulose, lacquer, plasticized, with, castor, oil., Because, of, the, lacquer's, inherent, properties,, acetate, discs, are, the, least, stable, type, of, sound, recording., Continuous, Shrinkage, of, the, lacquer, coating, due, to, the, loss, of, the, castor, oil, plasticizer, is, the, primary, destructive, force., The, gradual, loss, of, plasticizer, causes, progressive, embrittlement, and, the, irreversible, loss, of, sound, information., Because, the, coating, is, bonded, to, a, core, which, cannot, shrink,, internal, stresses, result,, which, in, turn, cause, cracking, and, peeling, of, the, coating., Nitrocellulose, acetate, decomposes, continuously, and, over, time, reacts, with, water, vapour, or, oxygen, to, produce, acids, that, act, as, a, catalyst, for, several, other, chemical, reactions., As, with, most, chemical, reactions,, these, reactions, are, accelerated, with, elevated, temperature, and, humidity, levels., Vulcanite, (early, Berliner, records), Vulcanite, (hard, rubber), was, the, first, material, used, commercially, by, Berliner, and, provided, the, necessary, basis, for, the, exploitation, of, the, flat, disc., In, 1839, Hancock, in, England, and, Goodyear, in, the, US, independently, discovered, vulcanization., Vulcanization, is, the, process, of, treating, crude, rubber, with, sulfur, or, sulfur, compounds, in, varying, proportions, and, at, different, temperatures., The, result, is, an, increase, in, the, rubber's, strength, and, elasticity,, yielding, either, soft, rubber, or, vulcanite., Vulcanite, has, been, used, to, make, combs,, buttons,, jewels,, fountain, pens,, musical, instruments,, etc., Vulcanite, is, stable, in, the, dark, and, retains, its, appearance, and, properties, very, well., In, response, to, light, and/or, heat, the, material, loses, sulfur, then, becomes, brittle, and, loses, its, shine., Light, induces, oxidation, of, the, rubber, and, forms, oxides, of, sulfur, and, sulfuric, acid, in, the, presence, of, humidity., The, acidity, builds, up, to, a, level, at, which, the, degrading, plastic, is, attacked, and, eventually, decomposes1., The, degradation, can, be, demonstrated, when, playing, an, afflicted, Berliner., The, surface, of, the, disc, is, shaved, off, by, the, pressure, of, the, stylus, against, the, groove, wall., Vulcanite, also, posed, problems, in, the, production, of, discs., The, uneven, shrinkage, during, cooling, caused, severe, warping;, entrapped, gas, would, produce, blisters;, hard, particles, create, loud, pops, and, clicks;, and, the, coarseness, of, the, Vulcanite, structure, produced, terrible, background, noise., Shellac, Discs, The, first, shellac, discs, date, form, the, early, 1900s., Shellac, is, a, composite, word--it's, a, combination, of, shell, and, lac., The, word, is, a, Hindus, name, of, an, insect, that, infests, certain, types, of, trees., The, lac, draws, sap, from, these, trees,, processes, it, through, its, digestive, system, and, secretes, it, so, that, it, becomes, an, attached, protective, shell, around, its, body., Thus, the, shell, is, generally, smaller, than, a, grain, of, rice., Harvest, involved, scraping, off, the, encrusted, shells, from, twigs, and, branches., After, WWII, resins, such, as, Vinsol,, Valite,, Vynil, chloride, acetate, and, other, commercial, resins, replaced, organic, shellac, as, the, main, binder., These, plastics, are, slightly, more, stable, than, organic, type, discs., It, is, often, difficult, to, distinguish, between, shellac, and, shellac, type, discs, by, inspection., Determining, the, causes, of, shellac, disc, degradation, is, rather, difficult, because, a, very, wide, range, of, qualities, of, shellac, and, "fillers", have, been, used, by, manufacturers., Therefore, one, cannot, expect, consistent, behavior, of, all, stored, shellac, discs., The, disc, properties, are, as, much, a, function, of, the, filler, as, they, are, of, the, cementing, agent., The, fillers, used, run, the, gamut, of, natural, cellulosic, materials, as, well, as, of, minerals., For, example, two, separate, chemical, analyses, of, "typical", shellac, discs, showed, the, following:, Example, 12, Shellac, 13.5%, White, filler, (powdered, Indiana, limestone), 37.5%, Red, filler, (powdered, red, Pennsylvania, slate), 37.5%, Vinsol, (type, of, plastic, with, a, low, melting, point), 8.5%, Congo, Gum, (flexible, binder), 1%, Carbon, Black, (colorant, for, appearance), 1.5%, Zinc, stearate, (lubricant, for, mold, release), .5%, Example, 23, Flake, Shellac, 15.63%, Congo, Gum, 6.51%, Vinsol, Resin, 5.86%, Carbon, Black, (low, oil, content), 2.61%, Zinc, Sterate, 0.32%, Whiting, (CaCO3), 52.13%, Aluminum, Silicate, 13.03%, Flock, (long, fibre), 3.91%, The, average, shellac, content, in, these, "shellac", discs, is, approximately, 15%, shellac., Also,, record, manufacturers, would, introduce, scrap, as, filler, into, new, mixtures., The, manufacturers, would, recycle, returned,, unsold, shellac, discs., It, was, not, uncommon, for, the, scrap, to, included, soft, drink, bottles, litter,, pieces, of, masonry, or, other, unwanted, material,, all, of, which, were, ground, up, together, and, mixed, in, with, the, next, batch, of, compound.4, Columbia, discs, (laminated, disc), In, 1906, Columbia, introduced, the, Marconi, Velvet, Tone, developed, by, Giulemino, Marconi., The, manufacturing, technique, involved, using, a, craft, paper, core, cut, to, approximate, record, size., After, the, core, was, carefully, flattened, and, dried,, it, was, covered, with, a, powdered, shellac, compound, of, a, thin, uniform, thickness., The, dust-coated, core, was, put, in, an, oven, and, the, dust, fused, to, the, core., For, two-sided, records,, the, operation, was, repeated, for, the, other, side.5, The, advantage, of, this, construction, was, that, the, amount, of, surface, material, needed, to, carry, the, music, grooves, could, be, kept, very, small., This, economy, allowed, the, use, the, best, plastic, available, at, that, time., Edison, was, to, use, this, idea, in, 1912/13,, in, the, manufacturing, of, his, Diamond, Disc., In, 1922, Columbia, returned, to, the, laminated, record,, this, time, with, a, coarser, compound, for, the, powder, core, that, was, bonded, between, two, discs, of, craft, paper., In, general, shellac, discs, are, relatively, stable., The, curing, process, of, shellac, during, disc, manufacturing, generates, a, chemical, reaction, where, certain, simple, molecules, such, as, water, or, ammonia, molecules, are, eliminated., Curing, causes, shellac, to, shrink,, increasing, its, density, and, its, brittleness., This, condensation, continues, at, a, much, slower, rate, after, disc, manufacturing., The, speed, at, which, condensation, occurred, is, a, function, of, storage, temperature,, storage, humidity, and, completeness, of, cure., (The, condensation, reaction, reduces, the, potential, concentration, of, reacting, elements., A, semi-quantitative, measure, of, the, cure, of, shellac, is, its, solubility, in, alcohol., Raw, shellac, is, totally, soluble, in, alcohol, and, completely, cured, shellac, is, insoluble,, and, the, extent, to, which, condensation, has, proceeded, determines, the, degree, of, solubility, of, a, shellac.6), Thus, the, condensation, becomes, the, primary, degenerative, force., The, internal, reaction, of, the, material, and, the, rate, at, which, the, reaction, occurs, are, related, to, storage, temperature,, storage, humidity, (moisture, increases, the, condensation, reaction, rate), and, completeness, of, the, cured, shellac., Storage, stability, of, these, fillers, vary, widely., Organic, materials, in, the, aggregates, are, susceptible, to, fungus, attack,, while, shellac, itself, is, resistant, to, fungus, attack., In, a, proper, storage, environment,, these, discs, suffer, a, slow,, progressive, embrittlement, of, the, shellac., This, embrittlement, causes, a, fine, powder, to, be, shed, from, the, disc, after, each, playback., The, behaviour, of, the, other, aggregate, components, is, unpredictable,, due, to, the, wide, combinations, and, variety, of, materials, (and, of, material, quality), that, were, used., Edison, Diamond, disc, The, Edison, Diamond, disc, has, the, distinction, of, having, been, made, of, the, first, completely, synthetic, plastic,, a, material, called, phenol, (phenol, was, also, used, in, the, manufacture, of, Bakelite)., The, Edison, diamond, disc, is, a, laminated, disc, made, up, of, a, thick, core, and, a, thin, varnish, layers, covering, each, of, its, sides., The, ¼", core,, which, is, also, know, as, a, powder, blank,, was, manufactured, by, compressing, the, following, ingredients, in, the, following, proportions:7, Wood, flour, 58%, Modified, ethyl, alcohol, (AKA, ethynol), 26%, Phenol, formaldehyde, (AKA, Bakelite), 15%, Lampblack, (the, pigment), 1%, The, varnish,, named, Edison, condensite, varnish, was, made-up, of, Modified, ethyl, alcohol, 55%, Phenol, formaldehyde, (63%, phenol, +, 37%, formaldehyde), 38%, Other,, including, "Shino",, used, to, promote, a, gloss, finish, 7%, The, varnish, would, be, applied, to, the, blank, by, a, brush, as, the, blank, rotated, slowly., Four, applications, or, coats, were, given, each, blank, face, with, a, drying, period, between., After, the, last, coat, the, varnished, blank, would, be, placed, in, a, steam-heated, oven., This, completed, the, drying, and, also, effected, a, partial, reaction, of, the, varnish, ingredients, Prior, to, pressing,, the, blanks, would, be, heated, before, applying, pressure, to, soften., After, the, pressure, was, applied, the, heat, was, left, on, to, complete, the, curing, or, reaction, of, the, varnish., Then, the, moulds, were, cooled, and, the, pressure, released., Prolonged, contact, with, moisture, or, severe, changes, in, humidity, may, cause, damage, to, the, surface, through, moisture, absorption., In, general, Phenol, is, very, stable, and, presents, no, serious, degradation, problems,, neither, is, it, prone, to, attack, by, bacteria,, fungi, or, insects, although,, occasionally,, under, humid, conditions, moulds, may, grow, and, cause, some, surface, attack, on, a, nutrient, filler, such, as, wood, or, cotton,, or, be, supported, by, a, nutrient, contaminant, on, the, surface., Vinyl, Discs, Thus, far,, vinyl, has, proven, to, be, the, most, stable, of, the, materials, that, have, been, used, in, the, manufacture, of, sound, recordings.8, However,, although, stable,, its, life, is, not, indefinite., Pickett, and, Lemcoe,, in, Preservation, and, Storage, of, Sound, Recordings,, states, that, "failure, by, chemical, degradation, of, a, vinyl, disc, in, ordinary, library, environments, should, not, occur, in, less, than, a, century".9, Vinyl, discs, are, made, of, polyvinyl, chloride, (PVC), and, a, small, percentage, (usually, less, than, 25, percent), of, "fillers",, stabilizer,, pigment,, anti-static, substances,, etc., Internal, plasticization,, through, a, copolymerizing, of, vinyl, acetate, with, vinyl, chloride,, is, needed, to, achieve, the, required, properties, for, the, desired, application., Polyvinyl, chloride, degrades, chemically, when, exposed, to, ultraviolet, light, or, to, heat., Phonograph, discs, are, exposed, to, high, temperatures, during, moulding, and, pressing., Unless, stopped,, this, heat, would, be, a, catalyst, for, ongoing, dehydrochlorination,, which, is, the, release, of, hydrochloric, acid, (HCl), from, the, PVC, as, a, result, of, thermo-degradation., Stabilization, is, therefore, achieved, by, adding, a, chemical, to, the, resin, during, manufacture., This, does, not, prevent, the, degradation, but, controls, it,, mainly, by, consuming, the, free, HCl., Sufficient, effective, stabilizer, remains, in, a, plastic, phonograph, disc, to, protect, it, for, several, decades, after, pressing., Magnetic, Tape, Magnetic, tape, first, appeared, in, North, America, just, after, World, War, II., Magnetic, tape, is, made, up, of, two, layers:, a, "base", layer,, and, a, thin, "binder", layer, which, is, bonded, onto, the, base., The, binder, contains, ferromagnetic, particles, whose, permanent, alignment, within, the, binder, produce, the, copy, of, sound, waves., Magnetic, Tape, Binder, Manufacturers, are, very, secretive, about, the, specific, chemical, makeup, of, their, products., Binder, chemical, composition,, uniformity, and, smoothness, of, application, all, affect, audio, quality,, noise, level,, tape-to-head, contact,, and, friction., These, factors, also, affect, the, tape's, aging, properties., The, most, common, binder, resin, used, today, is, polyester, polyurethane., The, most, common, ferromagnetic, particle, used, is, gamma, ferric, oxide, (Fe3O2)., Numerous, additives, may, be, used, during, the, various, manufacturing, stages,, including:, solvents,, used, to, obtain, a, suitable, viscosity, of, emulsion, and, to, improve, the, mixing, and, bonding, operations;, wetting, agents,, used, to, break, binder/particle, mixing, tension, to, produce, a, more, even, ferromagnetic, particle, dispersion, within, the, binder;, plasticizers,, used, to, add, suppleness, to, plastic;, stabilizers,, used, mostly, as, antioxidants, to, avoid, chemical, degradation, that, could, lead, to, physical, breakdown;, lubricants,, used, to, reduce, drag, so, that, speed, deviation, problems, such, as, "wow", and, "flutter", are, diminished,, and, to, minimize, wear, damage, to, heads;, fine, mineral, powders,, used, to, make, polymers, harder, and, more, resistant, to, abrasion;, conduction, discharge, (material, such, as, carbon, black),, used, to, discharge, electrical, charges;, and, fungicides., The, most, common, and, serious, magnetic, tape, degradation, occurs, through, hydrolysis,, the, chemical, reaction, wherein, an, ester, such, as, the, binder, resin, "consumes", water, drawn, from, humidity, in, the, air, to, liberate, carboxylic, acid, and, alcohol., Hydrolysis, in, magnetic, tape, results, in, the, binder, shedding, a, gummy, and, tacky, material, which, causes, tape, layers, to, stick, together, and, inhibits, playback, when, it, is, deposited, onto, the, tape, recorder, heads., The, added, friction, increases, tape, stress, and, can, cause, machines, to, stop., Hydrolysis, also, causes, a, weakening, in, the, bond, holding, the, binder, to, the, backing,, which, results, in, shedding, or, possible, detachment., Chromium, dioxide, (CrO2), is, used, extensively, as, the, ferromagnetic, particles, in, cassette, magnetic, tape., It, has, been, found, that, CrO2, particles, interact, with, the, polyester, polyurethane, to, accelerate, hydrolytic, degradation., Additives, are, now, added, to, retard, this, degradation., Other, problems, associated, with, binder, manufacturing, and, deterioration, are:, incomplete, dispersion, of, the, ferromagnetic, particles,, causing, momentary, loss, of, signal, ("dropout");, a, weak, bond, that, causes, the, binder, to, separate, from, the, backing;, lubricants, that, evaporate, to, the, point, where, tapes, are, unplayable;, fine, oxide, powders, that, shed, from, tapes, and, deposit, onto, heads,, inhibiting, playback., Magnetic, Tape, Backing, The, backing,, which, is, the, structural, support, of, the, tape,, must, resist, stresses, imposed, by, playback, and, storage, without, becoming, permanently, deformed, (e.g.,, stretching),, or, losing, dimensional, stability, (e.g.,, expanding, through, absorption, of, moisture, or, heat)., Most, magnetic, tape, backing, has, been, made, of, either, cellulose, acetate, or, polyester,, materials, that, have, dissimilar, physical, and, aging, properties., Cellulose, acetate-backed, tapes, were, manufactured, from, about, 1935, until, the, early, 1960s., These, tapes, rely, heavily, on, plasticizer, additives, for, suppleness,, and, these, plasticizers, are, liable,, over, time,, to, evaporate, and, crystallize., These, tapes, have, extremely, low, tensile, strength, and, are, easily, broken., Cellulose, acetate, tapes, are, very, susceptible, to, linear, expansion, in, humid, and/or, warm, conditions., Because, of, the, different, properties, of, the, binder, and, the, base,, the, absorption, of, humidity, and, heat, result, in, tape, curling, and, edge, fluttering., These, distortions, greatly, affect, the, tape-to-head, contact,, which, in, turn, directly, affects, audio, quality., Repeated, dimensional, changes, due, to, environmental, fluctuations, grossly, affect, winding, tension, and, can, promote, binder, fatigue,, cracking,, and, finally,, catastrophic, failure, (i.e.,, the, irreversible, loss, of, data)., A, serious, problem, affecting, acetate, tape, is, that, of, the, "Vinegar, Syndrome"., Vinegar, Syndrome, is, exhibited, by, the, release, an, acetic, acid, (vinegar), odour, from, the, tape, and, is, a, by-product, of, acetate, tape, breaking-down., The, process, is, accelerated, by, the, presence, of, moisture, and, iron, ferromagnetic, particles, in, the, tapes.10, When, the, acetate, is, degrading--giving, off, acetic, acid--it, will, start, to, take, up, more, moisture., The, process, of, self-destruction, is, auto, catalytic,, once, it, has, started, it, will, continue, with, ever, increasing, speed;, no, solution, for, its, interruption, has, yet, been, found., Tapes, afflicted, with, the, vinegar, syndrome, will, infect, healthy, tapes., Polyester, ("mylar"), came, into, use, in, the, early, 1960s,, and, quickly, replaced, cellulose, acetate, for, magnetic, tape, backing., Accelerated, aging, tests, have, found, polyester, to, be, a, stable, material, which, in, fact, undergoes, hydrolysis, degradation, at, a, much, slower, rate, than, does, the, binder,, polyester, polyurethane,, with, which, it, is, combined., However,, polyester-based, tape, has, a, high, tensile, strength, that, can, cause, it, to, stretch, irreparably, (instead, of, breaking, cleanly, and, reparably, as, does, acetate-backed, tape)., A, third, coating, is, now, added, to, professional,, modern, tape, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, binder., Made, of, carbon, black, particles, held, in, a, thin, binder,, it, protects, the, backing, from, scratches,, minimizes, static, electricity,, and, provides, a, more, even, wind., PRESERVATION, OF, SOUND, RECORDINGS, A, good, definition, of, preservation, put, forward, by, the, International, Institute, for, Conservation--Canadian, Group, and, the, Canadian, Association, of, Professional, Conservators, is, that, preservation, encompasses, "all, actions, taken, to, retard, deterioration, of,, or, to, prevent, damage, to,, cultural, property., Preservation, involves, controlling, the, environment, and, conditions, of, use,, and, may, include, treatment, in, order, to, maintain, a, cultural, property,, as, nearly, as, possible,, in, an, unchanging, state."11, There, are, essentially, only, three, concerns, to, consider, when, handling, and, storing, sound, recordings:, that, they, be, kept, free, of, any, foreign, matter, deposits;, that, they, be, kept, free, of, any, pressure, that, might, cause, deformations;, and, that, they, be, stored, in, a, stable,, controlled, environment., 1., FOREIGN, MATTER, DEPOSITS, General, Dirt, can, be, classified, into, two, categories:, (1), Foreign, matter, deposits, which, are, not, part, of, the, original, object,, such, as, grease, from, fingerprints,, soot,, stains,, adhesives,, etc., and, (2), alterations, of, original, object, material, through, chemical, reactions, (whether, internal, reactions, or, reactions, with, environmental, agents)., Metal, corrosion, products,, palmitic, acid, from, acetate, discs,, or, a, gummy, substance, on, tapes, are, examples, of, alteration, in, the, state, of, the, original.12, Dust, is, commonly, a, mixture, of, fragments, of, human, skin,, minute, particles, of, mineral, or, plant, material,, textile, fibres,, industrial, smoke,, grease, from, fingerprints,, and, other, organic, and, inorganic, materials., There, are, often, salts, such, as, sodium, chloride, (carried, in, from, sea, spray, or, on, skin, fragments),, and, sharp, gritty, silica, crystals., In, this, chemical, mixture, are, the, spore, of, countless, moulds,, fungi, and, micro-organisms, which, live, on, the, organic, material, in, the, dust, (fingerprints,, for, example,, serve, as, good, culture, media)., Much, of, the, dirt, is, hygroscopic, (water-attracting), and, this, tendency, can, encourage, the, growth, of, moulds,, as, well, as, increase, the, corrosiveness, of, salts,, hydrolysis, and, the, release, of, acids.13, Dust, (including, fingerprints), will, negatively, affect, sound, recording, preservation, in, a, number, of, ways:, Discs, Dust, is, abrasive,, and, combined, with, the, pressure, exerted, on, the, groove, walls, by, the, stylus,, can, permanently, etch, the, walls, worse,, dust, can, also, be, imbedded, permanently, into, thermoplastic, substances., Only, a, small, point, of, the, stylus, is, actually, making, contact, with, the, groove, walls., One, and, a, half, grams, of, stylus, pressure, on, such, a, minute, surface, translates, to, several, tons, of, pressure, per, square, inch., The, resulting, drag, generates, enough, heat, that, the, plastic, partially, melts, (though, not, enough, to, deform),, causing, a, microscopic, flow, around, the, stylus, into, which, dust, can, be, embedded, permanently., Tapes, Dust, attracts, and, traps, moisture, and, will, precipitate, hydrolysis,, a, common, and, serious, cause, of, long-term, magnetic, tape, degradation., Also,, dust, may, cause, permanent, damage, to, the, tape, when, the, abrasiveness, of, the, dust, along, with, the, pressure, exerted, between, the, tape, surface, and, the, tape, recorder, heads, will, scratch, the, oxide, layer, and, the, tape, recorder, heads., CDs, Since, there, is, no, physical, contact, at, playback,, there, is, virtually, no, chance, of, physical, damage, occurring, during, playback, due, to, dust, deposits., Nevertheless,, dust, will, impede, proper, playback, by, obstructing, the, reading, of, the, information,, while, it, may, also, affect, the, long-term, preservation., At, present,, the, precise,, long-term, degradation, mechanisms, for, the, CD, are, still, unknown., If, dust, is, improperly, removed,, permanent, physical, damage, will, occur, owing, to, the, scratching, of, the, protective, layer, physical, damage, will, occur, owing, to, the, scratching, of, the, protective, layer., To, minimize, foreign, matter, deposits:, General:, Never, touch, the, surface, of, a, recording., Use, clean,, white, lintless, cotton, gloves, and, handle, by, the, edges., Recordings, should, not,, unnecessarily,, be, left, exposed, to, open, air., Return, items, to, their, containers, when, not, in, use, and, never, leave, storage, containers, open., Do, not, place, recordings, near, sources, of, dust, including, paper, or, cardboard, dust., Keep, the, surrounding, area, clean., Do, not, consume, food, or, beverages, in, the, area, in, which, recordings, are, handled., Keep, storage, facilities, as, clean, and, dust-free, as, possible., The, air, conditioning, system, should, be, equipped, with, dust, filtering, equipment., Keep, labelling, to, a, minimum,, but, limit, the, placement, of, labels,, especially, pressure, sensitive, labels,, to, the, container, using, conservation, ink., Keep, equipment, clean,, well, adjusted, and, in, good, working, condition., Grooved, discs, Do, not, use, paper, or, cardboard, inner, sleeves, and, do, not, store, records, without, inner, sleeves., Use, soft, polyethylene, inner, sleeves., Do, not, use, record, sleeves, made, of, PVC., Remove, grooved, discs, from, the, jacket, (with, the, inner, sleeve), by, bowing, the, jacket, open, by, holding, it, against, the, body, and, applying, a, slight, pressure, with, a, hand., Pull, the, disc, out, by, holding, a, corner, of, the, inner, sleeve., Avoid, pressing, down, onto, the, disc, with, the, fingers, as, any, dust, caught, between, the, sleeve, and, the, disc, will, be, pressed, into, the, grooves., Remove, grooved, discs, from, the, inner, sleeve, by, bowing, the, inner, sleeve, and, letting, it, slip, gradually, into, an, open, hand, so, that, the, edge, falls, on, the, inside, of, the, thumb, knuckle., The, middle, finger, should, reach, for, the, centre, label., Never, reach, into, the, sleeve., To, hold, a, disc,, place, the, thumb, on, the, edge, of, the, disc,, and, the, rest, of, the, fingers, of, the, same, hand, on, the, centre, label, for, balance., Use, both, hands, on, the, edge, to, place, disc, on, turntable., Tapes, Do, not, store, paper, inside, reel-to-reel, tape, box., After, removing, the, end, tab, from, the, virgin, reel-to-reel, tape,, cut, off, one-and-one-half, wraps, of, the, tape., This, is, to, avoid, any, adhesive,, left, by, the, end, tab,, from, being, transferred, to, the, machine, or, causing, layer-to-layer, adhesion, of, the, tape., CD, Remove, CDs, from, their, case, by, pressing, thumb, and, third, finger, on, edge, of, the, disc, near, the, top, and, bottom, of, the, case, and, pressing, on, the, plastic, clasp, in, the, center, with, the, other, hand., Cleaning14, Since, dust, is, usually, held, in, place, by, electrostatic, attraction,, dry, wiping, on, its, own, does, not, work, effectively., The, added, friction, created, by, the, duster, will, cause, the, dust, to, jump, back, to, the, charged, surface., Distilled, water, is, used, for, cleaning, records, and, CDs, for, many, reasons., Its, precise, chemical, makeup, is, known,, it, will, not, leave, any, residue, behind,, is, safe, to, use,, and, is, inexpensive., Water, disperses, static, charges, and, counteracts, the, increase, in, conductivity, from, the, pick-up, of, salt, deposits, from, finger, prints., However,, water, alone, cannot, dissolve, grease,, thus, surfactants, are, used, as, additives, to, enable, water, to, be, a, grease, solvent., Surfactants, break, grease, surface, bonds, and, allow, water, to, penetrate, grease, solids,, causing, swelling, and, then, random, dispersion., General, The, Canadian, Conservation, Institute, (CCI), recommends, the, use, of, nonionic,, ethelyne, oxide, condensates, surfactants, to, clean, sound, recordings., The, CCI, does, not, foresee, long-term, problems, associated, with, the, use, of, nonionic, surfactants, such, as, Tergitol., Tergitol, 15-S-3, is, an, oil, soluble, surfactant, and, 15-S-9, is, a, water, soluble, surfactant., Combined, they, remove, a, wide, range, of, dirt, and, greases, and, can, safely, be, used, on, sound, recordings., Use, 0.25, part, of, Tergitol, 15-S-3, and, 0.25, parts, of, Tergitol, 15-S-9, per, 100, parts, of, distilled, water., (These, products, are, available, in, small, quantities, from, TALAS, (Division, of, Technical, Library, Service, Inc), 213, West, 35th, Street,, New, York,, N.Y., (212), 465-8722.), The, recording, must, then, be, rinsed, thoroughly, with, distilled, water, to, eliminate, any, trace, of, detergent, residue., Keep, an, airgun, handy, to, blow, off, light, surface, dust., Grooved, discs, Grooved, discs, are, best, cleaned, using, a, record, cleaning, machine, such, as, the, Keith, Monks,, VPI,, Nitty, Gritty, using, 0.25, part, of, Tergitol, 15-S-3, and, 0.25, parts, of, Tergitol, 15-S-9, per, 100, parts, of, distilled, water., These, machines, allow, for, an, even, dispersion, of, fluid, and, can, then, vacuum, the, liquid, leaving, a, clean,, dry, surface., The, discs, must, then, be, rinsed, thoroughly, with, distilled, water, and, vacuumed, dry, to, eliminate, any, trace, of, detergent, residue., Records, should, be, cleaned, before, each, playback., Clean, Vulcanite, discs, showing, signs, of, acid, build, up, using, 0.25, part, of, Tergitol, 15-S-3, and, 0.25, parts, of, Tergitol, 15-S-9, per, 100, parts, of, distilled, water, and, rinse, thoroughly., Clean, acetate, discs, showing, signs, of, palmitic, acid, deposits, (white, greasy, substance, on, acetate, disc, surface), as, if, cleaning, LPs,, except, add, 1, part, ammonia, per, 100, to, the, Tergitol, cleaning, solution., Do, not, use, ammonia, on, shellac, based, discs., Tapes, Vacuum, reel-to-reel, tape, pack, if, dusty., Use, a, vacuum, which, has, a, hose,, and, keep, the, motor, away, from, the, tape, in, order, to, reduce, the, risk, of, magnetizing, the, tapes., Clean, tape, surfaces, using, a, product, such, as, 3M, "Tape, Cleaning, Fabric", (610-1-150)., This, soft, fabric, product, will, pick-up, loose, debris, commonly, found, on, tape, surfaces, after, being, dislodged, by, the, fabric, fibers., CDs, An, air, gun, should, be, used, to, blow, off, any, light, surface, dust., If, fingerprints, or, other, stains, must, be, removed,, 0.25, part, of, Tergitol, 15-S-3, and, 0.25, parts, of, Tergitol, 15-S-9, per, 100, parts, of, distilled, water, can, be, utilized, safely., Carefully, blot, the, area, of, the, disc, needing, washing, with, a, soft, cloth, (preferably, a, soft, cotton, that, has, been, washed, several, times), imbued, with, a, concentration, of, Tergitol, and, distilled, water., Rinse, well, using, a, second, cloth, soaked, in, distilled, water., Blot, dry, using, a, soft, cotton, cloth., Use, an, airgun, to, blow, off, any, lint, left, over., Avoid, rubbing, in, any, direction., 2., SURFACE, DEFORMATIONS, Since, the, surface, of, a, sound, recording, is, the, information, carrier,, it, is, critical, that, the, surface, be, well, cared, for., Physical, deformations, such, as, warping, of, discs,, stretching, of, tape, or, shock, from, dropping, them,, will, directly, affect, sound, information, integrity., One, must, develop, a, respect, for, the, integrity, of, the, artifact., To, minimize, deformations, General, Never, leave, recordings, near, sources, of, heat, or, light, (especially, ultraviolet, light), as, plastics, are, adversely, affected, by, both., Do, not, place, heavy, objects, on, top, of, recordings., Recordings, should, never, be, placed, on, top, of, each, other., Shelve, recordings, vertically;, do, not, stack, "off, vertical", or, horizontally., Do, not, use, shelving, units, where, supports, put, more, pressure, on, one, area, of, the, recording, or, where, supports, are, more, than, four, to, six, inches, apart., Do, not, interfile, recordings, of, different, sizes, as, smaller, items, may, get, lost, or, damaged,, while, larger, items, may, be, subjected, to, uneven, pressure., Discs, Remove, shrink-wrap, on, LPs, completely., Shrink-wrap, can, continue, to, shrink,, thus, warping, the, disc., Tapes, Do, not, drop, tapes., The, shock, could, partially, rearrange, the, ferromagnetic, particles,, effectively, attenuating, high, frequencies., Store, tapes, away, from, any, sources, of, magnetic, fields., Do, not, store, reel-to-reel, tapes, in, a, plastic, bag, within, tape, box., The, plastic, bag, will, trap, moisture., Handle, reel-to-reel, tapes, by, the, hub, rather, than, the, flanges, as, the, pressure, on, the, flanges, will, damage, them, and, ultimately, damage, the, tape, edges., Ten-inch, reels, should, have, supports, in, their, boxes, so, that, the, hub, bears, the, weight, of, the, tapes, rather, than, the, flanges., Rewind, (exercise), reel-to-reel, tapes, every, 3½, years, to, work, out, stresses, which, may, have, crept, in, through, linear, expansions, and, contractions.., Store, reel-to-reel, tapes, with, an, "archival, wind"., Wind, tapes, slowly, so, that, air, pockets, between, layers, do, not, form, causing, successive, layers, to, be, placed, unevenly, on, top, of, each, other., The, unevenness, will, cause, stress,, expose, binder, to, air, and, exposes, edges, to, possible, physical, damage, by, the, flanges., A, reel-to-reel, tape, deck, with, the, heads, removed, can, be, used, to, rewind, tape, in, the, regular, play, mode., The, tape, tension, might, have, to, be, readjusted, to, compensate, for, the, removal, of, the, heads., 3., ENVIRONMENT, A, proper, environment, for, the, storage, of, sound, recording, is, essential, to, retard, degradation, mechanisms., Elevated, temperature, and, humidity, can, affect, certain, chemical, properties, of, the, plastics, that, make, up, recording, media, and, can, also, create, an, environment, that, encourages, the, growth, of, fungus., Wide, or, rapid, fluctuations, of, the, environment, are, equally, detrimental, to, the, long, term, preservation, of, sound, artifacts., Acetate, discs, Shrinkage, of, the, lacquer, coating, due, to, the, loss, of, plasticizer, is, the, primary, destructive, force, of, these, discs., Excess, moisture, will, accelerate, plasticizer, loss., Acetate, discs, decompose, continuously,, and, over, time, react, with, water, vapour, or, oxygen, to, produce, acids, that, in, turn, act, as, catalysts, for, several, other, chemical, reactions., One, of, these, is, the, release, of, palmitic, acid,, a, white, waxy, substance., Acetate, discs, are, very, susceptible, to, fungus, growth., Excess, heat, will, probably, accelerate, the, loss, of, the, coating, adhesion., Vulcanite, discs, Vulcanite, discs, are, adversely, affected, by, elevated, levels, of, light,, heat, and, humidity., In, response, to, light, and, heat,, Vulcanite, loses, sulfur., Light, induces, oxidation, and, form, oxides, of, sulfur, and, sulfuric, acid, in, the, presence, of, humidity., The, acidity, builds, up, to, a, level, at, which, the, degrading, material, is, attacked, and, eventually, decomposed.15, Shellac, discs, High, humidity, levels, accelerate, the, embrittlement, of, shellac, discs., This, embrittlement, causes, a, fine, powder, to, be, shed, from, the, disc, after, each, playback,, effectively, scraping, away, groove, information., The, severity, of, the, embrittlement, is, unpredictable,, due, to, the, wide, combinations, and, variety, of, materials, (and, of, material, quality), that, were, used, during, their, production., The, average, shellac, content, in, a, shellac, disc, is, approximately, 15, %, with, the, remaining, 85%, composed, of, aggregates., Organic, materials, in, the, aggregates, are, susceptible, to, fungus, attack,, while, shellac, itself, is, said, to, be, fungus-resistant., Vinyl, discs, Vinyl, discs, are, adversely, affected, by, ultraviolet, light, and, thermal, cycling, (heat, fluctuation)., The, consequence, of, thermal, cycling, is, that, each, cycle, of, temperature, results, in, a, small, irreversible, deformation,, and, these, deformations, are, cumulative.16, Vinyl, discs, are, resistant, to, fungal, growth, and, are, unaffected, by, high, humidity, levels., Tapes, Hydrolysis, is, the, chemical, reaction, whereby, the, binder, resin, "consumes", water, drawn, from, humidity, in, the, air, to, liberate, carboxylic, acid, and, alcohol., Hydrolysis, in, magnetic, tape, results, in, the, binder, shedding, a, gummy, and, tacky, material, which, causes, tape, layers, to, stick, together, and, inhibits, playback, when, it, is, deposited, onto, the, tape, recorder, heads., Hydrolysis, also, causes, a, weakening, in, the, bond, holding, the, binder, to, the, backing,, which, results, in, shedding, or, possible, detachment., Cellulose, acetate, backed, tapes, are, very, susceptible, to, linear, expansion, in, humid, and/or, warm, conditions., Because, of, the, different, properties, of, the, binder, and, the, base,, the, absorption, of, humidity, and, heat, result, in, tape, curling, and, edge, fluttering., Repeated, dimensional, changes, due, to, environmental, fluctuations, grossly, affect, winding, tension, (hence, the, need, for, periodic, rewinding), and, can, promote, binder, fatigue,, cracking,, and, finally,, the, irreversible, loss, of, sound, information, (known, as, catastrophic, failure)., Tape, binder, is, somewhat, susceptible, to, fungi, growth, though, less, so, with, modern, tapes, as, fungicides, are, presently, incorporated, into, the, binder., The, process, of, the, break-down, of, acetate, backed, tape, is, exhibited, by, the, release, of, acetic, acid., It, is, accelerated, by, the, presence, of, moisture, and, iron, ferromagnetic, particles, in, the, tapes., When, the, acetate, is, degrading--giving, off, acetic, acid, odour--it, starts, to, take, up, more, moisture., The, process, of, self-destruction, is, autocatalytic., CDs, The, compact, disc, is, a, laminate, of, 4, different, materials., The, bottom, of, the, disc, is, made, of, polycarbonate, onto, which, the, pits, containing, the, digitized, sound, information, are, stamped., A, thin, layer, of, aluminum, is, then, applied,, covering, the, pits., A, thin, lacquer, coating, (which, becomes, the, top, of, the, disc), is, then, applied, to, cover, the, aluminum, layer,, and, finally, the, ink, for, the, labeling., As, with, any, laminated, products,, one, must, wonder, how, the, aging, characteristics, of, each, material, will, interact, with,, and, affect, adjacent, layers., Proper, storage, environment, Store, recordings, at, a, maintained, temperature, of, between, no, more, than, 15-20°C., Fluctuation, of, temperature, should, not, vary, more, than, 2°C, in, a, 24-hour, period., Maintain, a, relative, humidity, of, 25-45%., Fluctuation, of, relative, humidity, should, not, vary, more, than, 5%, in, a, 24-hour, period.17, Maintain, proper, ventilation, and, air, circulation, of, stacks, at, all, times, to, avoid, any, micro, climates., Keep, sound, recordings, in, dark, storage, when, not, being, consulted., Fit, light, fixtures, with, fluorescent, tubes, which, do, not, produce, ultraviolet, radiation, in, excess, of, 75, µw/lm, (microwatts, per, lumen)., Separate, and, isolate, from, tape, vault, acetate, tapes, exhibiting, an, acetic, acid, odour., Copy, the, tapes, promptly., CONCLUSION, Over, the, past, century,, recorded, sound, has, become, an, intrinsic, part, of, our, culture., Upon, hearing, an, early, sound, recording, device, in, 1888,, Sir, Arthur, Sullivan, stated, that, he, was, "astonished, and, somewhat, terrified, at, the, result, of, this, evening's, experiments--astonished, at, the, wonderful, power, you, have, developed,, and, terrified, at, the, thought, that, so, much, hideous, and, bad, music, may, be, put, on, record, forever."18, Unfortunately,, sound, recordings, are, not, "forever"., These, are, ephemeral, documents,, both, in, their, physical, composition, and, consequently, in, the, means, by, which, the, sound, is, ultimately, retained., They, can, have, their, life, span, shortened, considerably, by, both, internal, and, external, forces., By, undertaking, certain, precautionary, measures,, custodians, of, the, heritage, of, sound, can, lengthen, considerably, their, collection's, life, span, thus, preserving, a, rich,, invaluable, world, of, sound., BIBLIOGRAPHY, ANSI/AES, Work, Group, II.--Environmental, Storage, Conditions, (Draft, 2)., January, 25,, 1991., Archiving, the, Audiovisual,
