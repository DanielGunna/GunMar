Oct, 10,, 2011, Although, the, Japanese, have, been, producing, great, art, and, writing, about, it, for, many, centuries,, the, philosophical, discipline, in, Japan, corresponding, to, Western, “aesthetics”, did, not, get, underway, until, the, nineteenth, century., A, good, way, to, survey, the, broader, field, is, to, examine, the, most, important, aesthetic, ideas, that, have, arisen, in, the, course, of, the, tradition,, all, of, them, before, aesthetics, was, formally, established, as, a, discipline:, namely,, mono, no, aware, (the, pathos, of, things),, wabi, (subdued,, austere, beauty),, sabi, (rustic, patina),, yūgen, (mysterious, profundity),, iki, (refined, style),, and, kire, (cutting)., (This, last, Japanese, term, is, pronounced, as, two, evenly, accented, syllables,, the, second, of, which, rhymes, with, the, vowel, sound, of, “red.”, The, macrons, over, some, vowels, signify, a, vowel, sound, of, double, length., When, someone's, family, and, given, name, are, used,, the, order, is, the, conventional, Japanese, one:, family, name,, then, given, name.), 1., Introduction, 2., Mono, no, aware:, the, Pathos, of, Things, 3., Wabi:, Subdued,, Austere, Beauty, 4.,

Related, Entries, 1., Introduction, Two, preliminary, observations, about, the, Japanese, cultural, tradition, to, begin, with., The, first, is, that, classical, Japanese, philosophy, understands, the, basic, reality, as, constant, change,, or, (to, use, a, Buddhist, expression), impermanence., The, world, of, flux, that, presents, itself, to, our, senses, is, the, only, reality:, there, is, no, conception, of, some, stable, “Platonic”, realm, above, or, behind, it., The, arts, in, Japan, have, traditionally, reflected, this, fundamental, impermanence—sometimes, lamenting, but, more, often, celebrating, it., The, idea, of, mujō, (impermanence), is, perhaps, most, forcefully, expressed, in, the, writings, and, sayings, of, the, thirteenth-century, Zen, master, Dōgen,, who, is, arguably, Japan's, profoundest, philosopher,, but, here, is, a, fine, expression, of, it, by, a, later, Buddhist, priest,, Yoshida, Kenkō,, whose, Essays, in, Idleness, (Tsurezuregusa,, 1332), sparkles, with, aesthetic, insights:, It, does, not, matter, how, young, or, strong, you, may, be,, the, hour, of, death, comes, sooner, that, you, expect., It, is, an, extraordinary, miracle, that, you, should, have, escaped, to, this, day;, do, you, suppose, you, have, even, the, briefest, respite, in, which, to, relax?, (Keene,, 120), In, the, Japanese, Buddhist, tradition,, awareness, of, the, fundamental, condition, of, existence, is, no, cause, for, nihilistic, despair,, but, rather, a, call, to, vital, activity, in, the, present, moment, and, to, gratitude, for, another, moment's, being, granted, to, us., The, second, observation, is, that, the, arts, in, Japan, have, tended, to, be, closely, connected, with, Confucian, practices, of, self-cultivation,, as, evidenced, in, the, fact, that, they, are, often, referred, to, as, “ways, [of, living]”:, chadō,, the, way, of, tea, (tea, ceremony),, shōdō,, the, way, of, writing, (calligraphy),, and, so, forth., And, since, the, scholar, official, in, China, was, expected, to, be, skilled, in, the, “Six, Arts”—ceremonial, ritual,, music,, calligraphy,, mathematics,, archery,, and, charioteering—culture, and, the, arts, tend, to, be, more, closely, connected, with, intellect, and, the, life, of, the, mind, than, in, the, western, traditions., To, this, day, it, is, not, unusual, in, Japan, for, the, scholar, to, be, a, fine, calligrapher, and, an, accomplished, poet, in, addition, to, possessing, the, pertinent, intellectual, abilities., 2., Mono, no, aware:, the, Pathos, of, Things, The, meaning, of, the, phrase, mono, no, aware, is, complex, and, has, changed, over, time,, but, it, basically, refers, to, a, “pathos”, (aware), of, “things”, (mono),, deriving, from, their, transience., In, the, classic, anthology, of, Japanese, poetry, from, the, eighth, century,, the, Manyōshū,, the, feeling, of, aware, is, typically, triggered, by, the, plaintive, calls, of, birds, or, other, animals., It, also, plays, a, major, role, in, the, world's, first, novel,, Murasaki, Shikibu's, Genji, monogatari, (The, Tale, of, Genji),, from, the, early, eleventh, century., The, somewhat, later, Heike, monogatari, (The, Tale, of, the, Heike, Clan), begins, with, these, famous, lines,, which, clearly, show, impermanence, as, the, basis, for, the, feeling, of, mono, no, aware:, The, sound, of, the, Gion, shōja, bells, echoes, the, impermanence, of, all, things;, the, color, of, the, sōla, flowers, reveals, the, truth, that, the, prosperous, must, decline., The, proud, do, not, endure,, they, are, like, a, dream, on, a, spring, night;, the, mighty, fall, at, last,, they, are, as, dust, before, the, wind., (McCullough, 1988), And, here, is, Kenkō, on, the, link, between, impermanence, and, beauty:, “If, man, were, never, to, fade, away, like, the, dews, of, Adashino,, never, to, vanish, like, the, smoke, over, Toribeyama,, how, things, would, lose, their, power, to, move, us!, The, most, precious, thing, in, life, is, its, uncertainty”, (Keene,, 7)., The, acceptance, and, celebration, of, impermanence, goes, beyond, all, morbidity,, and, enables, full, enjoyment, of, life:, How, is, it, possible, for, men, not, to, rejoice, each, day, over, the, pleasure, of, being, alive?, Foolish, men,, forgetting, this, pleasure,, laboriously, seek, others;, forgetting, the, wealth, they, possess,, they, risk, their, lives, in, their, greed, for, new, wealth., But, their, desires, are, never, satisfied., While, they, live, they, do, not, rejoice, in, life,, but,, when, faced, with, death,, they, fear, it—what, could, be, more, illogical?, (Keene,, 79), Insofar, as, we, don't, rejoice, in, life, we, fail, to, appreciate, the, pathos, of, the, things, with, which, we, share, our, lives., For, most, of, us,, some, of, these, things,, impermanent, as, they, are,, will, outlast, us—and, especially, if, they, have, been, loved, they, will, become, sad, things:, “It, is, sad, to, think, that, a, man's, familiar, possessions,, indifferent, to, his, death,, should, remain, long, after, he, is, gone”, (Keene,, 30)., The, well, known, literary, theorist, Motoori, Norinaga, brought, the, idea, of, mono, no, aware, to, the, forefront, of, literary, theory, with, a, study, of, The, Tale, of, Genji, that, showed, this, phenomenon, to, be, its, central, theme., He, argues, for, a, broader, understanding, of, it, as, concerning, a, profound, sensitivity, to, the, emotional, and, affective, dimensions, of, existence, in, general., The, greatness, of, Lady, Murasaki's, achievement, consists, in, her, ability, to, portray, characters, with, a, profound, sense, of, mono, no, aware, in, her, writing,, such, that, the, reader, is, able, to, empathize, with, them, in, this, feeling., The, films, of, Ozu, Yasujirō,, who, is, often, thought, to, be, the, most, “Japanese”, of, Japanese, film, directors,, are, a, series, of, exercises, in, conveying, mono, no, aware., Stanley, Cavell's, observation, that, “film, returns, to, us, and, extends, our, first, fascination, with, objects,, with, their, inner, and, fixed, lives”, applies, consummately, to, Ozu,, who, often, expresses, feelings, through, presenting, the, faces, of, things, rather, than, of, actors., A, vase, standing, in, the, corner, of, a, tatami-matted, room, where, a, father, and, daughter, are, asleep;, two, fathers, contemplating, the, rocks, in, a, “dry, landscape”, garden,, their, postures, echoing, the, shapes, of, the, stone;, a, mirror, reflecting, the, absence, of, the, daughter, who, has, just, left, home, after, getting, married—all, images, that, express, the, pathos, of, things, as, powerfully, as, the, expression, on, the, greatest, actor's, face., The, most, frequently, cited, example, of, mono, no, aware, in, contemporary, Japan, is, the, traditional, love, of, cherry, blossoms,, as, manifested, by, the, huge, crowds, of, people, that, go, out, every, year, to, view, (and, picnic, under), the, cherry, trees., The, blossoms, of, the, Japanese, cherry, trees, are, intrinsically, no, more, beautiful, than, those, of,, say,, the, pear, or, the, apple, tree:, they, are, more, highly, valued, because, of, their, transience,, since, they, usually, begin, to, fall, within, a, week, of, their, first, appearing., It, is, precisely, the, evanescence, of, their, beauty, that, evokes, the, wistful, feeling, of, mono, no, aware, in, the, viewer., 3., Wabi:, Simple,, Austere, Beauty, In, his, Essays, in, Idleness, Kenkō, asks,, “Are, we, to, look, at, cherry, blossoms, only, in, full, bloom,, at, the, moon, only, when, it, is, cloudless?”, (Keene,, 115)., If, for, the, Buddhists, the, basic, condition, is, impermanence,, to, privilege, as, consummate, only, certain, moments, in, the, eternal, flux, may, signify, a, refusal, to, accept, that, basic, condition., Kenkō, continues:, “To, long, for, the, moon, while, looking, on, the, rain,, to, lower, the, blinds, and, be, unaware, of, the, passing, of, the, spring—these, are, even, more, deeply, moving., Branches, about, to, blossom, or, gardens, strewn, with, faded, flowers, are, worthier, of, our, admiration.”, This, is, an, example, of, the, idea, of, wabi,, understated, beauty,, which, was, first, distinguished, and, praised, when, expressed, in, poetry., But, it, is, in, the, art, of, tea,, and, the, context, of, Zen,, that, the, notion, of, wabi, is, most, fully, developed., In, the, Nampōroku, (1690),, a, record, of, sayings, by, the, tea, master, Sen, no, Rikyū,, we, read:, “In, the, small, [tea], room,, it, is, desirable, for, every, utensil, to, be, less, than, adequate., There, are, those, who, dislike, a, piece, when, it, is, even, slightly, damaged;, such, an, attitude, shows, a, complete, lack, of, comprehension”, (Hirota,, 226)., Implements, with, minor, imperfections, are, often, valued, more, highly,, on, the, wabi, aesthetic,, than, ones, that, are, ostensibly, perfect;, and, broken, or, cracked, utensils,, as, long, as, they, have, been, well, repaired,, more, highly, than, the, intact., The, wabi, aesthetic, does, not, imply, asceticism, but, rather, moderation,, as, this, passage, from, the, Nampōroku, demonstrates:, “The, meal, for, a, gathering, in, a, small, room, should, be, but, a, single, soup, and, two, or, three, dishes;, sakè, should, also, be, served, in, moderation., Elaborate, preparation, of, food, for, the, wabi, gathering, is, inappropriate”, (Hirota,, 227)., The, Zencharoku, (Zen, Tea, Record,, 1828), contains, a, well, known, section, on, the, topic, of, wabi,, which, begins, by, saying, that, it, is, simply, a, matter, of, “upholding, the, [Buddhist], precepts”, (Hirota,, 274)., The, author, continues:, Wabi, means, that, even, in, straitened, circumstances, no, thought, of, hardship, arises., Even, amid, insufficiency,, one, is, moved, by, no, feeling, of, want., Even, when, faced, with, failure,, one, does, not, brood, over, injustice., If, you, find, being, in, straitened, circumstances, to, be, confining,, if, you, lament, insufficiency, as, privation,, if, you, complain, that, things, have, been, ill-disposed—this, is, not, wabi”, (Hirota,, 275)., The, way, of, tea, exemplifies, this, attitude, toward, life, in, the, elegant, simplicity, of, the, tea, house, and, the, utensils,, which, contradicts, any, notion, that, beauty, must, entail, magnificence, and, opulence., Wabi, reaches, its, peak, of, austerity, in, emptiness—which, is, a, central, and, pervasive, idea, in, Buddhism., In, an, essay, “In, Praise, of, Shadows”, (1933), the, great, novelist, Tanizaki, Jun'ichirō, (1886–1965), has, this, to, say, about, the, beauty, of, the, alcove, (tokonoma), in, the, traditional, Japanese, teahouse:, An, empty, space, is, marked, off, with, plain, wood, and, plain, walls,, so, that, the, light, drawn, into, it, forms, dim, shadows, within, emptiness., There, is, nothing, more., And, yet,, when, we, gaze, into, the, darkness, that, gathers, behind, the, crossbeam,, around, the, flower, vase,, beneath, the, shelves,, though, we, know, perfectly, well, it, is, mere, shadow,, we, are, overcome, with, the, feeling, that, in, this, small, corner, of, the, atmosphere, there, reigns, complete, and, utter, silence;, that, here, in, the, darkness, immutable, tranquility, holds, sway., (Tanizaki,, 20), A, simple, structure,, but, a, special, and, evocative, one,, a, place, of, deeply, philosophical, depths., A, space, cut, out, of, the, room,, which, cuts, off, direct, light, and, thereby, opens, up, a, new, world:, these, techniques, developed, distinctively, in, the, Japanese, tradition, of, architecture., (See, section, 7,, below,, on, cutting.), This, was, the, genius, of, our, ancestors,, that, by, cutting, off, the, light, from, this, empty, space, they, imparted, to, the, world, of, shadows, that, formed, there, a, quality, of, mystery, or, depth, superior, to, that, of, any, wall, painting, or, ornament., The, technique, seems, simple,, but, was, by, no, means, so, simply, achieved., Instead, of, adding, something, artistic, to, the, wall, one, subtracts, the, wall, itself, and, sets, it, back, into, an, alcove., Then, let, the, emptiness, that's, opened, up, fill, with, a, play, of, light, and, shades., One, place, with, a, claim, to, be, where, the, Japanese, tea, ceremony, originated, is, Ginkakuji,, The, Temple, of, the, Silver, Pavilion,, in, Kyoto., Whereas, the, pavilion, (late, 15th, century), is, a, modest, monument, to, the, joys, of, sabi,, the, Moon-Viewing, Platform, and, Sea, of, Silver, Sand, beside, it, (from, some, 200, years, later), are, paradigms, of, Wabi., These, latter, two, constitute, an, unusual, version, of, the, distinctively, Japanese, “dry, landscape”, style, of, garden, (see, section, 7,, below)., These, strikingly, abstract, formations, (for, the, 17th, century!), are, optimally, viewed, from, the, second, floor, of, the, pavilion, on, a, night, of, the, full, moon,, when, the, sand, glistens, silver, in, the, moonlight, and, the, stripes, appear, as, waves, on, the, surface, of, a, motionless, ocean., Larger, Photographs, of, the, Sea, of, Silver, Sand, and, Moon-Viewing, Platform, at, Ginkakuji, 4., Sabi:, Rustic, Patina, The, term, sabi, occurs, often, in, the, Manyōshū,, where, it, has, a, connotation, of, desolateness, (sabireru, means, “to, become, desolate”),, and, later, on, it, seems, to, acquire, the, meaning, of, something, that, has, aged, well,, grown, rusty, (another, word, pronounced, sabi, means, “rust”),, or, has, acquired, a, patina, that, makes, it, beautiful., The, importance, of, sabi, for, the, way, of, tea, was, affirmed, by, the, great, fifteenth-century, tea, master, Shukō,, founder, of, one, of, the, first, schools, of, tea, ceremony., As, a, distinguished, commentator, puts, it:, “The, concept, sabi, carries, not, only, the, meaning, ‘aged’—in, the, sense, of, ‘ripe, with, experience, and, insight’, as, well, as, ‘infused, with, the, patina, that, lends, old, things, their, beauty’—but, also, that, of, tranquility,, aloneness,, deep, solitude”, (Hammitzsch,, 46)., The, feeling, of, sabi, is, also, evoked, in, the, haiku, of, the, famous, seventeenth-century, poet, Matsuo, Bashō,, where, its, connection, with, the, word, sabishi, (solitary,, lonely), is, emphasized., The, following, haiku, typifies, sabi(shi), in, conveying, an, atmosphere, of, solitude, or, loneliness, that, undercuts,, as, Japanese, poetry, usually, does,, the, distinction, between, subjective, and, objective:, Solitary, now, —, Standing, amidst, the, blossoms, Is, a, cypress, tree., Contrasting, with, the, colorful, beauty, of, the, blossoms,, the, more, subdued, gracefulness, of, the, cypress—no, doubt, older, than, the, person, seeing, it, but, no, less, solitary—typifies, the, poetic, mood, of, sabi., Tanizaki's, “In, Praise, of, Shadows”, frequently, celebrates, sabi., By, contrast, with, Western, taste,, he, writes, of, the, Japanese, sensibility:, We, do, not, dislike, everything, that, shines,, but, we, do, prefer, a, pensive, lustre, to, a, shallow, brilliance,, a, murky, light, that,, whether, in, a, stone, or, an, artifact,, bespeaks, a, sheen, of, antiquity., ., ., ., We, love, things, that, bear, the, marks, of, grime,, soot,, and, weather,, and, we, love, the, colors, and, the, sheen, that, call, to, mind, the, past, that, made, them., (Tanizaki,, 11–12), This, is, a, significant, existential, consideration:, the, sheen, of, older, things, connects, us, with, the, past, in, ways, that, shiny, products, of, modern, technology, simply, cannot., And, since, older, things, tend, to, be, made, from, natural, materials,, to, deal, with, them, helps, us, to, realize, our, closest, connections, with, the, natural, environment., Sabi, figures, prominently,, for, Tanizaki,, in, the, aesthetics, of, the, traditional, Japanese, toilet,, which, “stands, apart, from, the, main, building, at, the, end, of, a, corridor,, in, a, grove, fragrant, with, leaves, and, moss.”, He, wrestles, with, the, vexations, that, modern, technology, imposes, on, the, question, of, fixtures,, as, the, traditional, ones, are, superseded, by, “white, porcelain, and, handles, of, sparkling, metal”, (Tanizaki,, 3,, 6)., Wood, finished, in, glistening, black, lacquer, is, the, very, best,, but, even, unfinished, wood,, as, it, darkens, and, the, grain, grows, more, subtle, with, the, years,, acquires, an, inexplicable, power, to, calm, and, soothe., The, ultimate,, of, course,, is, a, wooden, “morning, glory”, urinal, filled, with, boughs, of, cedar:, this, is, a, delight, to, look, at, and, allows, not, the, slightest, sound., (Tanizaki,, 6), But, the, primary, delights, of, the, traditional, Japanese, toilet, are, its, closeness, to, nature:, in, that, special, place,, “surrounded, by, tranquil, walls, and, finely, grained, wood,, one, looks, out, upon, blue, skies, and, green, leaves”, (Tanizaki,, 4)., Among, the, achievements, of, traditional, Japanese, architecture, Tanizaki, praises, the, toilet, as, “the, most, aesthetic.”, Our, forbears,, making, poetry, of, everything, in, their, lives,, transformed, what, by, rights, should, be, the, most, unsanitary, room, in, the, house, into, a, place, of, unsurpassed, elegance,, replete, with, fond, association, with, the, beauties, of, nature., It, is, surely, fitting, that, one, should, perform, those, most, natural, functions, of, urinating, and, defecating,, returning, to, the, earth, the, waste, from, its, bounties,, in, natural, rather, than, high-tech, surroundings., A, more, exalted, exemplification, of, sabi, is, the, exquisite, Silver, Pavilion, at, Ginkakuji, in, Kyoto., Even, though, the, tea, ceremony, is, said, to, have, originated, here,, in, a, small, sabi-saturated, teahouse,, the, exterior, of, the, pavilion, was, originally, going, to, be, covered, in, silver, foil,, in, emulation, of, the, Golden, Pavilion, (14th, century), at, Kinkakuji., Without, ever, having, enjoyed, a, coating, of, silver,, the, Silver, Pavilion, is, the, epitome, of, sabi, and, one, of, the, most, graceful, structures, ever, built., The, contrast, with, the, larger,, and, flashier, Golden, Pavilion,, whose, coating, of, gold, leaf, lends, it, a, quite, different, (and, distinctly, un-sabi), kind, of, beauty,, is, instructive., Larger, Photographs, of, the, Silver, Pavilion, at, Ginkakuji, and, the, Golden, Pavilion, at, Kinkakuji, In, 1950, a, deranged, Buddhist, acolyte,, deeply, disturbed, by, the, beauty, of, the, Golden, Pavilion,, set, fire, to, it, and, burned, it, to, the, ground., An, exact, replica, was, built, on, the, original, site, in, 1955., The, aesthetic, qualities, of, the, original, structure, are, celebrated, in, Mishima, Yukio's, fine, novel, The, Temple, of, the, Golden, Pavilion, (1956),, as, well, as, in, Ichikawa, Kon's, classic, film, Enjo, (Conflagration,, 1958)., In, 1987,, the, burgeoning, Japanese, economy, made, it, possible, for, the, first, time, in, the, building's, history, to, cover, the, structure, with, gold, leaf,, according, to, the, creator's, original, intention., The, result, is, breathtakingly, spectacular—but, totally, un-Japanese., Old-time, residents, of, Kyoto, famously, complained, that, it, would, take, a, long, time, for, the, building, to, acquire, sufficient, sabi, to, be, worth, looking, at, again., At, the, rate, the, patina, seems, to, be, progressing,, probably, several, centuries., In, 2011,, after, the, tsunami, in, Tōhoku, and, the, explosions, and, nuclear, meltdown, in, Fukushima, caused, an, acute, energy, shortage, in, Japan,, one, of, many, responses, was, a, dramatic, reduction, of, lighting, in, public, places,, and, especially, in, subway, stations, with, extensive, underground, restaurant, and, shopping, precincts., Tanizaki, cites, a, prescient, remark, from, the, late, 1920s, to, the, effect, that, “perhaps, no, two, countries, waste, more, electricity, than, America, and, Japan”, (Tanizaki,, 35)., He, would, be, delighted, now, to, see, Japanese, cities, reducing, the, ubiquitous, glare, of, neon, lighting, and, all-night, electric, illumination,, in, a, dimming, of, unnecessary, lights, which, thereby, reintroduces, some, of, the, shadows, he, so, eloquently, praises., 5., Yūgen:, Profound, Grace, Yūgen, may, be,, among, generally, recondite, Japanese, aesthetic, ideas,, the, most, ineffable., The, term, is, first, found, in, Chinese, philosophical, texts,, where, it, has, the, meaning, of, “dark,”, or, “mysterious.”, Kamo, no, Chōmei,, the, author, of, the, well-known, Hōjōki, (An, Account, of, my, Hut,, 1212),, also, wrote, about, poetry, and, considered, yūgen, to, be, a, primary, concern, of, the, poetry, of, his, time., He, offers, the, following, as, a, characerization, of, yūgen:, “It, is, like, an, autumn, evening, under, a, colorless, expanse, of, silent, sky., Somehow,, as, if, for, some, reason, that, we, should, be, able, to, recall,, tears, well, uncontrollably.”, Another, characterization, helpfully, mentions, the, importance, of, the, imagination:, “When, looking, at, autumn, mountains, through, mist,, the, view, may, be, indistinct, yet, have, great, depth., Although, few, autumn, leaves, may, be, visible, through, the, mist,, the, view, is, alluring., The, limitless, vista, created, in, imagination, far, surpasses, anything, one, can, see, more, clearly”, (Hume,, 253–54)., This, passage, instantiates, a, general, feature, of, East-Asian, culture,, which, favors, allusiveness, over, explicitness, and, completeness., Yūgen, does, not,, as, has, sometimes, been, supposed,, have, to, do, with, some, other, world, beyond, this, one,, but, rather, with, the, depth, of, the, world, we, live, in,, as, experienced, through, cultivated, imagination., The, art, in, which, the, notion, of, yūgen, has, played, the, most, important, role, is, the, Nō, drama,, one, of, the, world's, great, theater, traditions,, which, attained, its, highest, flourishing, through, the, artistry, of, Zeami, Motokiyo, (1363–1443)., Zeami, wrote, a, number, of, treatises, on, Nō, drama,, in, which, yūgen, (“Grace”), figures, as, “the, highest, principle”, (Rimer,, 92)., He, associates, it, with, the, highly, refined, culture, of, the, Japanese, nobility,, and, with, their, speech, in, particular,, though, there, is, also, in, Nō, a, “Grace, of, music,”, a, “Grace, of, performance, [of, different, roles],”, and, a, “Grace, of, the, dance”, (Rimer,, 93)., It, is, something, rare,, that, is, attained, only, by, the, greatest, actors, in, the, tradition,, and, only, after, decades, of, dedicated, practice, of, the, art., It, is, impossible, to, conceptualize,, so, that, Zeami, often, resorts, to, imagery, in, trying, to, explain, it:, “Cannot, the, beauty, of, Grace, be, compared, to, the, image, of, a, swan, holding, a, flower, in, its, bill,, I, wonder?”, (Rimer,, 73)., The, most, famous, formulation, comes, at, the, beginning, of, Zeami's, “Notes, on, the, Nine, Levels, [of, artistic, attainment, in, Nō],”, where, the, highest, level, is, referred, to, as, “the, art, of, the, flower[ing], of, peerless, charm”:, The, meaning, of, the, phrase, Peerless, Charm, surpasses, any, explanation, in, words, and, lies, beyond, the, workings, of, consciousness., It, can, surely, be, said, that, the, phrase, ‘in, the, dead, of, night,, the, sun, shines, brightly’, exists, in, a, realm, beyond, logical, explanation., Indeed,, concerning, the, Grace, of, the, greatest, performers, in, our, art, [it, gives, rise, to], the, moment, of, Feeling, that, Transcends, Cognition,, and, to, an, art, that, lies, beyond, any, level, that, the, artist, may, consciously, have, attained., (Rimer,, 120), This, passage, alludes, to, the, results, of, a, pattern, of, rigorous, discipline, that, informs, many, “performing, arts”, (which, would, include, the, tea, ceremony, and, calligraphy, as, well, as, theater), in, Japan,, as, well, as, East-Asian, martial, arts., Nō, is, exemplary, in, this, respect,, since, its, forms, of, diction,, gestures,, gaits,, and, dance, movements, are, all, highly, stylized, and, extremely, unnatural., The, idea, is, that, one, practices, for, years, a, “form”, (kata), that, goes, counter, to, the, natural, movements, of, the, body, and, thus, requires, tremendous, discipline—to, the, point, of, a, breakthrough, to, a, “higher, naturalness”, that, is, exhibited, when, the, form, has, been, consummately, incorporated., This, kind, of, spontaneity, gives, the, impression,, as, in, the, case, of, Grace,, of, something, “supernatural.”, 6., Iki:, Refined, Style, The, Structure, of, “Iki”, (“Iki”, no, kōzō), by, Kuki, Shūzō, (1888–1941), is, arguably, the, most, significant, work, in, Japanese, aesthetics, from, the, twentieth, century—and, certainly, one, of, the, shortest., Kuki, wrote, the, first, draft, in, 1926, while, living, in, Paris,, toward, the, end, of, a, seven-year, stay, in, Europe,, and, published, the, book, shortly, after, returning, to, Japan, in, 1929., It's, a, phenomenological, and, hermeneutic, study, of, a, phenomenon,, iki,, that, was, central, to, Japanese, aesthetic, life, during, the, previous, two, or, three, hundred, years, and, derived, from, forms, of, erotic, relations, between, men, and, geisha, in, the, pleasure, quarters, of, the, big, cities., Kuki, remarks, that, although, the, French, terms, chic,, coquet,, and, raffiné, share, connotations, with, the, term, iki,, no, European, word, is, capable, of, translating, the, richness, of, its, meanings—unsurprisingly,, since, it, emerged, from, a, particular, cultural, context, and, Kuki, is, concerned, to, grasp, the, “living, form”, of, the, phenomenon, as, experienced., Kuki, mentions, the, French, esprit, and, the, German, Sehnsucht, as, terms, that, are, similarly, untranslatable,, for, similar, reasons, of, cultural, embeddedness, (Nara,, 15–16)., Kuki, distinguishes, two, further, “moments”, of, iki, in, addition, to, its, basis, in, seductiveness, or, coquetry, (bitai):, “brave, composure”, (ikiji), and, “resignation”, (akirame)., Insofar, as, iki, as, seductiveness, is, concerned, “to, maintain, a, dualistic, relationship,, protecting, the, possibility, as, possibility”—an, allusion, to, Heidegger's, existential, conception, of, death, as, ultimate, possibility—it, already, embraces, impermanence, and, mortality., This, protection, of, possibility, is, thus, enhanced, by, brave, composure,, which, for, Kuki, is, exemplified, in, the, attitude, toward, death, (his, own, and, others'), on, the, part, of, the, samurai, warrior, and, his, way, of, living, (bushidō)., It, is, enhanced, too, by, the, moment, of, resignation,, which, Kuki, understands, as, the, Buddhist, attitude, of, non-attachment, to, a, world, of, impermanence., All, together, they, enable, a, kind, of, aesthetic, “play”,, thanks, to, a, (phenomenological), “bracketing”, of, the, concerns, of, everyday, life, (Nara,, 18–23)., After, positioning, the, phenomenon, of, iki, among, a, variety, of, other, aesthetic, feelings, such, as, sweet, (amami), versus, astringent, (shibumi),, flashy, (hade), versus, quiet, (jimi),, and, crude, (gehin), versus, refined, (jōhin),, Kuki, goes, on, to, examine, the, objective, expressions, of, the, phenomenon,, which, are, either, “natural”, or, “artistic”, (Nara,, 24–34)., In, nature,, willow, trees, and, slow,, steady, rain, exemplify, iki;, in, the, human, body, a, slight, relaxation,, a, voice, of, medium, rather, than, high, pitch,, a, face, that, is, long, rather, than, round,, a, certain, tension, and, relaxation, together, of, the, eyes,, mouth,, and, cheeks,, the, hand, curved, or, slightly, bent, back., Also, iki, is, the, wearing, of, thin, fabric,, makeup, thinly, applied,, hair, styled, not, too, formally,, with, the, aid, of, water, rather, than, oil,, and, a, décolletage, designed, to, call, attention, to, the, nape, of, the, neck, laid, bare, (Nara,, 35–39)., In, the, “free, art”, of, design,, parallel, lines,, and, especially, vertical, stripes,, are, expressive, of, iki:, almost, all, the, other, beautiful, patterns, developed, by, Japanese, fabric, arts,, since, they, often, involve, curved, lines,, are, un-iki., The, only, colors, that, embody, iki, are, certain, grays,, browns,, and, blues., In, architecture, the, small, (four-and-a-half, mat), Zen, teahouse, is, a, paradigm, of, iki,, especially, insofar, as, it, initiates, an, interplay, between, wood, and, bamboo., Lighting, must, be, subdued:, indirect, daylight, or, else, the, kind, of, illumination, provided, by, a, paper, lantern., The, scales,, melodies,, and, rhythms, of, various, kinds, of, music, are, correspondingly, iki,, insofar, as, (alluding, to, Goethe,, Schelling,, and, Schopenhauer)“Architecture, is, frozen, music,, and, music, as, flowing, architecture”, (Nara,, 41–51)., In, his, conclusion,, Kuki, asks, whether, various, nineteenth-century, and, contemporary, European, arts, might, exemplify, iki, and, decides, probably, not, exactly,, though, he, allows, that, various, aspects, of, Baudelaire's, poetry, and, aesthetics, come, very, close, (with, the, difference, that, dandyism, is, a, male, prerogative, whereas, iki, is, associated, with, both, sexes)., During, his, seven, years, in, Germany, and, France, he, listened, to, lectures, and, seminars, by,, and, conversed, with,, such, figures, as, Heinrich, Rickert,, Edmund, Husserl,, Martin, Heidegger,, Henri, Bergson,, and, Jean-Paul, Sartre., Kuki, thereby, developed, a, sophisticated, understanding, of, European, philosophy, and, aesthetics,, and, was, concerned, after, his, return, to, Japan, to, apply, methods, he, had, learned, to, a, Japanese, aesthetic, phenomenon., He, didn't, therefore, aspire, to, any, kind, of, universal, aesthetics—since, iki, is, rooted, in, the, culture, of, a, particular, ethnic, group., Yet, because, the, Japanese, at, that, time,, under, geopolitical, pressure, to, modernise, more, efficiently,, were, losing, touch, with, their, own, traditions,, Kuki, took, it, as, one, of, his, tasks, to, celebrate, the, aesthetic, values, of, the, past, (Nara,, 58–60)., He, has, unfortunately, been, excoriated, on, these, grounds, as, an, ultranationalist, and, even, a, fascist,, notably, by, Leslie, Pincus, in, her, book, Authenticating, Culture, in, Imperial, Japan:, Kuki, Shūzō, and, the, Rise, of, National, Aesthetics,, and, this, deters, some, people, from, reading, him., But, while, Pincus's, book, provides, a, good, deal, of, helpful, historical, background, of, the, milieu, in, which, Kuki, was, working, in, Japan,, her, claims, that, he, was, a, fascist, are, groundless, (see, Parkes, 1997,, 2007)., An, unprejudiced, reading, of, The, Structure, of, Iki, reveals, no, fascist, tendencies, whatsoever,, and, the, nationalist, themes, are, innocuous,, simply, calling, for, a, remembering, of, what, is, valuable, in, the, Japanese, tradition, and, likely, to, be, lost, beneath, the, waves, of, modernisation—in, a, world, where, connections, with, the, past, were, withering, and, Japan, was, warding, off, the, colonisation, of, East, and, South, Asia, by, the, Western, powers., Kuki, is, a, fascinating, thinker,, and, The, Structure, of, Iki,, while, occasionally, tortuous, because, of, its, commitment, to, a, strictly, European, methodology,, illuminates, some, fascinating, aspects, of, the, Japanese, aesthetic, tradition, while, at, the, same, time, engaging, the, deepest, levels, of, experience, anywhere., 7., Kire:, Cutting, A, distinctive, notion, in, Japanese, aesthetic, discourse, is, that, of, the, “cut”, (kire), or,, “cut-continuity”, (kire-tsuzuki)., The, “cut”, is, a, basic, trope, in, Rinzai, School, of, Zen, Buddhism,, especially, as, exemplified, in, the, teachings, of, the, Zen, master, Hakuin, (1686–1769)., For, Hakuin, the, aim, of, “seeing, into, one's, own, nature”, can, only, be, realized, if, one, has, “cut, off, the, root, of, life”:, “You, must, be, prepared, to, let, go, your, hold, when, hanging, from, a, sheer, precipice,, to, die, and, return, again, to, life”, (Hakuin,, 133–35)., The, cut, appears, as, a, fundamental, feature, in, the, distinctively, Japanese, art, of, flower, arrangement, called, ikebana., The, term, means, literally, “making, flowers, live”—a, strange, name,, on, first, impression, at, least,, for, an, art, that, begins, by, initiating, their, death., There, is, an, exquisite, essay, by, Nishitani, Keiji, on, this, marvelous, art,, in, which, organic, life, is, cut, off, precisely, in, order, to, let, the, true, nature, of, the, flower, come, to, the, fore, (Nishitani,, 23–7)., There, is, something, curiously, deceptive,, from, the, Buddhist, viewpoint, of, the, impermanence, of, all, things,, about, plants,, which,, lacking, locomotion, and, by, sinking, roots, into, the, earth,, assume, an, appearance, of, being, especially, “at, home”, wherever, they, are., In, severing, the, flowers, from, their, roots,, Nishitani, suggests,, and, placing, them, in, an, alcove, (itself, cut, off, from, direct,, as, Tanizaki, remarks),, one, is, letting, them, show, themselves, as, they, truly, are:, as, absolutely, rootless, as, every, other, being, in, this, world, of, radical, impermanence., The, notion, of, cut-continuation, is, exemplified, in, the, highly, stylized, gait, of, the, actors, in, the, Nō, drama., The, actor, slides, the, foot, along, the, floor, with, the, toes, raised,, and, then, “cuts”, off, the, movement, by, quickly, lowering, the, toes, to, the, floor—and, beginning, at, that, precise, moment, the, sliding, movement, along, the, floor, with, the, other, foot., This, stylization, of, the, natural, human, walk, draws, attention, to, the, episodic, nature, of, life,, which, is, also, reflected, in, the, pause, between, every, exhalation, of, air, from, the, lungs, and, the, next, inhalation., Through, attending, to, the, breath, in, zen, meditation, one, becomes, aware, that, the, pause, between, exhalation, and, inhalation, is, different—more, of, a, cut—from, that, between, inhalation, and, exhalation., This, reflects, the, possibility, of, life's, being, cut, off, at, any, moment:, the, one, exhalation, that, isn't, followed, by, an, inhalation,, known, as, “breathing, one's, last.”, Cutting, also, appears, in, the, “cut-syllable”, (kireji), in, the, art, of, haiku, poetry,, which, cuts, off, one, image, from—at, the, same, time, as, it, links, it, to—the, next., There, is, a, famous, cut-syllable,, ya,, at, the, end, of, the, first, line, of, the, best, known, haiku, by, Bashō,, the, most, famous, haiku, poet:, Furuike, ya, Kawazu, tobikomu, Mizu, no, oto., Ah,, an, ancient, pond—, Suddenly, a, frog, jumps, in!, The, sound, of, water., The, most, distinctively, Japanese, style, of, garden,, the, “dry, landscape”, (karesansui), garden,, owes, its, existence, to, the, landscape's, being, “cut, off”, from, the, natural, world, beyond, its, borders., The, epitome, of, this, style, is, the, rock, garden, at, Ryōanji, in, Kyoto,, where, fifteen, “mountain”-shaped, rocks, are, set, in, beds, of, moss, in, a, rectangular, “sea”, of, white, gravel., Larger, Photographs, of, the, Dry, Landscape, Garden, at, Ryōanji, (The, Japanese, word, for, landscape,, sansui,, means, literally, “mountains, waters”:, see, Berthier, 2000.), At, Ryōanji, the, rock, garden, is, cut, off, from, the, outside, by, a, splendid, wall, that, is, nevertheless, low, enough, to, permit, a, view, of, the, natural, surroundings., This, cut,, which, is, in, a, way, doubled, by, the, angled, roof, that, runs, along, the, top, of, the, wall, and, seems, to, cut, it, off,, is, most, evident, in, the, contrast, between, movement, and, stillness., Above, and, beyond, the, wall, there, is, nature, in, movement:, branches, wave, and, sway,, clouds, float, by,, and, the, occasional, bird, flies, past., But, unless, rain, or, snow, is, falling,, or, a, stray, leaf, is, blown, across,, the, only, movement, visible, within, the, garden, is, shadowed, or, illusory,, as, the, sun, or, moon, casts, slow-moving, shadows, of, tree, branches, on, the, motionless, gravel., The, garden, is, cut, off, on, the, near, side, too,, by, a, border, of, pebbles, (larger,, darker,, and, more, rounded, than, the, pieces, of, gravel), that, runs, along, the, east, and, north, edges., There, is, a, striking, contrast, between, the, severe, rectangularity, of, the, garden's, borders, and, the, irregular, natural, forms, of, the, rocks, within, them., The, expanse, of, gravel, is, also, cut, through, by, the, upthrust, of, the, rocks, from, below:, earth, energies, mounting, and, peaking, in, irruptions, of, stone., Each, group, of, rocks, is, cut, off, from, the, others, by, the, expanse, of, gravel,, and, the, separation, is, enhanced, by, the, “ripple”, patterns, in, the, raking, that, surrounds, each, group, (and, some, individual, rocks)., And, yet, the, overall, effect, of, these, cuttings, is, actually, to, intensify, the, invisible, lines, of, connection, among, the, rocks,, whose, interrelations, exemplify, the, fundamental, Buddhist, insight, of, “dependent, co-arising”, (engi)., The, rock, garden, also, embodies, the, central, Buddhist, insight, of, impermanence., Insofar, as, its, being, cut, off, from, the, surrounding, nature, has, the, effect, of, drying, up, its, organic, life,, which, then, no, longer, decays, in, the, usual, manner., Being, dried, up, (the, kare, of, karesansui, means, “withered”),, the, mountains, and, waters, of, the, garden, at, Ryōanji, at, first, appear, less, temporary, than, their, counterparts, outside,, which, manifest, the, cyclical, changes, that, organic, life, is, heir, to., But, just, as, plants, look, deceptively, permanent, thanks, to, their, being, rooted, in, the, earth,, so, the, rocks, of, the, dry, landscape, garden, give, a, misleading, impression, of, permanence,, especially, when, one, revisits, them, over, a, period, of, years., As, participants, in, (what, Thoreau, called), “the, great, central, life”, of, the, earth,, rocks, have, a, life, that, unfolds, in, time, sequences, that, are, quite, different, from, ours—and, yet, also, subject, to, the, impermanence, that, conditions, all, things., 8., Ozu, Yasujirō:, Cinematic, Cuts, The, garden, at, Ryōanji, makes, a, brief, but, significant, appearance, in, one, of, the, classics, of, Japanese, cinema,, Ozu, Yasujirō's, Late, Spring, (1949)., It, comes, right, after, one, of, the, film's, most, famous, images:, a, vase, standing, on, a, tatami, mat, in, front, of, a, window, on, which, silhouettes, of, bamboo, are, projected., The, scene, in, question, consists, of, eight, shots,, seven, of, which, show, the, Ryōanji, rocks, (of, which, there, are, fifteen, in, total),, and, which, are, separated, and, joined, by, seven, cuts., (Ozu, hardly, ever, uses, any, other, transition, than, the, cut,, such, as, the, wipe.), After, two, shots, of, rocks, in, the, garden,, the, camera, angle, reverses, and, we, see, the, main, protagonist, with, his, friend—they, are, both, fathers, of, daughters—sitting, on, the, wooden, platform, with, the, tops, of, two, rocks, occupying, the, lower, part, of, the, frame., Two, rocks, and, two, fathers., Cut, to, a, close-up, of, the, fathers, from, their, left, side,, with, no, rocks, in, view., In, their, dark, suits,, and, seated, in, the, classic, Ozu, “overlapping, triangles”, configuration,, leaning, forward, toward, the, garden, with, their, arms, around, knees, drawn, up, toward, their, chins,, they, resemble, two, rocks., They, talk, about, how, they, raise, children, who, then, go, off, to, live, their, own, lives., As, they, invoke, such, manifestations, of, impermanence,, they, remain, motionless, except, for, the, occasional, nod, or, turn, of, the, head., Enlarged, Sequence, of, Stills, from, Late, Spring, In, their, brief, conversation, by, the, edge, of, the, garden,, the, two, fathers, do, little, more, than, exchange, platitudes, about, family, life—and, yet, the, scene, is, a, profoundly, moving, expression, of, the, human, condition., It, gains, this, effect, from, the, assimilation, of, the, figures, of, the, two, men, to, rocks,, which, seems, to, affirm, the, persistence, of, cycles, of, impermanence., These, images, of, assimilation, capture, one, of, the, central, ideas, behind, the, dry, landscape, garden:, that, of, the, continuum, between, human, consciousness, and, stone,, which, is, also, understandable, as, the, kinship, of, awareness, with, its, original, basis., The, opening, shots, of, Tokyo, Story, (1953),, which, some, consider, Ozu's, greatest, film,, are, also, exemplary, with, respect, to, the, cutting., The, first, shot, shows, a, shrine, sculpture, to, the, left, of, center, and, behind, it, an, estuary, with, a, boat, chugging, along, to, the, right,, in, the, direction, of, a, gradual, rise, of, hills, on, the, horizon., After, ten, seconds,, just, as, the, boat, is, about, to, disappear, beyond, the, frame—there, is, a, cut, to, the, pavement, on, the, side, of, a, street., A, cart, now, occupies, the, left, foreground, of, the, frame,, and, beside, it, stand, two, large, bottles, (Ozu's, signature, shapes)., Eight, small, children, in, school, uniform, walk, away, from, the, camera, to, the, right., Continuity, is, provided, by, a, parallel, between, the, river, and, horizon, of, the, first, scene, and, the, horizontal, lines, of, the, pavement, and, houses, in, the, second,, as, well, as, by, the, movement, toward, the, right., Also, aurally, by, the, continuing, sound, of, the, boat's, putt-putting., A, ninth, child, appears, and, as, he, passes, the, bottles, and, reaches, the, center, of, the, frame—there, is, a, cut, to, a, shot, over, the, roofs, of, houses, of, a, train, traveling, to, the, right,, with, behind, it, the, buildings, of, a, shrine, or, temple,, and, then, hills, behind, those., The, putting, sound, of, the, boat, continues, before, being, drowned, out, by, the, sound, of, the, train,, and, the, almost, horizontal, line, of, the, train's, passage, continue, to, be, congruent, with, those, of, the, street,, descending, gradually, to, the, right., Smoke, issues, from, two, chimneys, at, left, and, center,, the, scene, lasting, fifteen, seconds., As, the, end, of, the, train, reaches, the, center, of, the, frame—the, sound, continues, but, there, is, a, cut, to, a, closer, shot, of, the, train, from, the, hill, side,, so, that, it, is, now, moving, up, along, a, diagonal, to, the, left., Behind, the, houses, on, the, other, side, of, the, train, is, the, estuary, again., As, the, train's, whistle, blows—there, is, a, cut, to, a, shrine, surrounded, by, pine, trees, and, statuary, standing, on, an, embankment, with, the, estuary, in, the, background, on, the, far, left., Continuity, is, provided, by, a, chimney, in, the, foreground, that, spouts, smoke, as, the, train's, steam, whistle, continues., The, main, line, has, reverted, to, a, horizontal, line, rising, toward, the, right., After, six, seconds,, the, shortest, scene, so, far—there, is, a, cut, to, a, grandfather, and, grandmother, sitting, on, the, tatami, matting, of, their, home, in, the, village,, facing, toward, the, right., The, grandfather,, consulting, a, timetable,, says,, “We'll, pass, Osaka, at, around, 6:00, this, evening,”, referring, to, a, train, trip, they, are, just, about, to, take, to, Tokyo,, which, will, initiate, the, film's, main, action., Enlarged, Sequence, of, Stills, from, Tokyo, Story, For, each, cut, Ozu, has, arranged, for, at, least, one, formal, element, to, provide, continuity, (kire-tsuzuki), between, the, adjacent, scenes., There, are, of, course, other, directors, capable, of, consummate, cuts,, but, a, study, of, Ozu's, show, them, to, constitute, what, may, be, “the, kindest, cut, of, all”, in, world, cinema., Bibliography,
