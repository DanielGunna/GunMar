ThisBlogThis!Share, to, TwitterShare, to, Facebook, Labels:, dutch,, hiphop, Live, Review:, The, 1975, at, House, of, Blues, Boston,, December, 3rd!, The, 1975, After, two, non-stop, years, of, touring,, British, sensations, The, 1975, took, a, well-deserved, break, from, the, road., As, most, musicians, will, tell, you,, it, wasn’t, a, true, break, though, as, the, band, took, that, time, to, work, on, their, sophomore, effort, I, like, it, when, you, sleep,, for, you, are, so, beautiful, yet, so, unaware, of, it, that, will, be, releasing, February, 26th, of, next, year., With, the, singles, starting, to, roll, out, like, lead, off, track, Love, Me,, the, band, decided, to, play, the, last, small, room, tour, you, will, be, able, to, see, them, on., Small, rooms, being, a, casual, 2,500, at, the, House, of, Blues, in, Boston!, A, size, that, many, bands, would, love, the, chance, to, play., With, their, next, date, in, MA, being, at, the, Tsongas, arena, in, Lowell, in, May,, we, definitely, wanted, to, check, out, their, show, in, Boston, last, week!, Starting, out, the, set, with, the, current, single, Love, Me,, the, band,  played, a, large, part, of, their, set, before, even, saying, a, few, words, to, the, audience, which, Matt, Healy, mentioned,, saying, ‘Sorry, that, first, bit, of, the, show,, we’re, really, serious, we, don’t, talk, to, anyone’., Personally,, I, love, when, bands, stick, to, the, music, and, don’t, need, to, base, their, sets, of, off, witty, banter, (sometimes, they, do, this, beautifully, though, like, The, Struts, show, we, covered, but, they, do, only, have, eight, songs)., These, shows, have, been, mentioned, as, a, road, test, for, the, new, material, that, is, to, come, on, the, next, full, length, record, but, the, guys, did, perform, really, all, of, the, material, they, have, released, with, a, fair, blend, of, the, new., My, favorite, one, to, look, out, for, in, the, new, is, ‘She’s, American’,, an, incredibly, bouncy, track, that, will, get, anyone, moving., The, vibe, of, the, band, is, really, strong, on, this, show, and, was, my, favorite, performance, from, the, band, yet., They, clearly, have, their, rhythm, down, but, the, break, from, the, road, definitely, did, them, good., They, were, more, relaxed, on, stage., The, one, thing, that, I, didn’t, really, like, is, that, they, were, slow, lulls, in, the, set, and, then, instantly, upbeat., I, think, if, the, set, was, mixed, up, a, lot, more,, it, would, have, been, a, more, high, energy, set., At, points,, it, felt, very, sleepy, and, could, show, in, the, crowd., This, audience, was, filled, with, diehard, fans, though, and, it, didn’t, affect, them, very, much., They, perked, up, right, away, when, a, fan, favorite’s, opening, notes, were, heard., A, favorite, moment, for, me, was, when, front, man, Healy, said, ‘Ladies, and, Gentlemen, I, love, you., This, song’s, about, me’, and, jumped, into, ‘Falling, For, You’, which, got, the, biggest, crowd, reaction, yet, in, the, set., Ending, the, regular, set, on, Robbers, and, Girls,, the, guys, walked, off, stage, to, return, for, their, encore, to, the, chant, of, ‘Sex!, Sex!, Sex!’, instead, of, the, normal, one, more, song., After, playing, their, hit, Medicine,, they, went, into, Chocolate, and, Sex, with, Matty, yelling, ‘Until, then, we’ve, got, two, more, songs, I, bet, you, can’t, fucking, guess, what, they, are’, which, made, the, crowd, go, while., With, this, tour, being, the, band’s, last, tour, in, smaller, clubs,, I’m, glad, we, were, able, to, catch, them, play, to, a, sold, out, crowd, and, only, hope, to, see, this, band, explode, as, they, rightfully, deserve, and, already, have, begun, to., Continue,

Lights, Lately, I’ve, been, feeling, like, the, Canadian, Ambassador, for, the, music, scene, in, Boston, and, I, am, one, hundred, percent, okay, with, that., It’s, been, a, lot, of, the, boys, but, Saturday, night,, I, sat, down, with, a, lady, that, has, been, killing, it, in, both, countries, and, around, the, world, for, the, last, ten, years, or, so,, Lights!, She, is, currently, about, half, way, into, an, incredible, US, run,, including, selling, out, Boston, that, night., Her, latest, record,, Little, Machines,, has, had, much, acclaim, and, produced, several, big, hits, with, Lights, also, winning, a, Juno, (otherwise, known, as, a, Canadian, grammy), for, the, record., In, my, chat, with, her,, she, told, me, about, the, acoustic, record, that, her, and, her, band, have, been, working, on, as, well, as, the, fact, that, she, has, a, good, storage, of, new, material, that, she, has, been, working, on., Read, our, new, one, below, and, if, you’ve, been, sleeping, under, a, rock,, quickly, put, this, lady, into, your, music, rotation., Lights, is, incredibly, talented, and, completely, deserving, of, her, success!, A, soft, one, to, start,, I, know, you’ve, been, doing, this, tour, for, a, while., I, know, it’s, been, a, minute, since, you’ve, been, in, the, Boston,, the, tour, is, going, really, well, having, sold, out, dates., How, has, it, been, going, so, far, for, you?, Oh, it’s, been, so, fun., I, think, this, set, that, we’re, doing, on, this, tour, is, my, favorite, that, we’ve, done, so, far., There’s, a, bit, of, all, the, records, in, it, and, there’s, a, huge, dynamic, in, it., We, have, these, really, cool, surreal, moments, and, these, really, super, intimate, moments, and, that, makes, the, journey, for, me, go, by, really, quickly, and, that’s, when, you, know, you’re, having, fun, I, guess., Maybe, how, has, it, been, to, kind, of, return, and, play, to, these, crowds?, You, have, steadily, toured, the, states, which, a, lot, of, Canadian, artists, don’t, do., You, did, have, a, little, bit, of, a, break, you, know, obviously, you, had, your, daughter, which, is, kind, of, a, big, thing., Yeah, I, haven’t, had, a, break, since, I, had, her, (laughs)., Since, I’ve, had, her,, we’ve, been, on, three, US, tours,, four, I, guess., So, a, lot, of, these, cities, we, were, in,, if, we, weren’t, here, last, fall,, we, were, here, in, February, and, March, playing, shows, as, well., So, it’s, kind, of, amazing, to, be, able, to, come, back, once, or, even, twice,, three, times, in, a, year,, and, people, are, still, coming, to, the, shows., That’s, pretty, special., I, mean, it’s, a, grind., We’re, out, most, of, the, year, but, I, get, to, see, a, lot, of, familiar, faces, and, meet, new, people, every, time, we, come, through., Boston, is, actually, one, of, my, favorite, places, to, play., The, Boston, date, of, the, last, tour, which, was, a, year, ago, was, my, favorite, show, of, that, tour., It, was, amazing, so, I’m, excited, to, play, tonight., Then, you, pretty, steadily, release, new, music, and, Little, Machines, is, just, over, a, year, old., There, was, a, lot, of, success, with, it,, you, won, a, Juno, for, it., Maybe, are, you, currently, working, on, a, new, record, or, do, you, think, that’s, still, something, that’s, a, little, bit, away?, I’ve, been, writing, a, lot., I’ve, been, filling, the, time, that, I’ve, had, in-between, tours, and, promo, with, writing, so, I, think, I, have, two, albums, worth, of, material., I, think, it’s, just, important, to, keep, the, muscle, going, because, I’ve, learned, that, the, hard, way, the, last, time, around., I, toured, without, writing, then, when, I, got, back, into, it,, the, muscle, was, out, of, shape, and, I, went, into, this, severe, bout, of, writer’s, block, and, the, story, unfolds, from, there, but, to, counter, that, this, time,, I’ve, just, been, writing, a, lot., In, all, the, spaces, in-between, but, actually, in, terms, of, releases, coming, up,, we, have, an, incredible, stripped, down, acoustic, version, of, Little, Machines, waiting, to, come, out., I, can’t, wait, for, people, to, hear, it., It’s, a, selection, of, songs, that, you, wouldn’t, the, least, expect, to, be, turned, into, acoustic, versions, on, the, record., We, brought, in, a, string, quartet,, we, brought, the, band, in, to, sort, of, play, these, late, night, drunken, versions, of, the, songs., It’s, one, of, my, most, powerful, pieces, I, think., I, can’t, wait, for, people, to, hear, it., Next, few, months,, next, few, months!, Next, few, months?, And, that’s, something, you’ve, done, before., I, know, you, did, the, acoustic, tour,, an, acoustic, release., Is, that, something, you, think, you’ll, continue, to, do, in, the, future, considering, what, you’ve, done, with, it, so, far?, Yeah!, The, reason, I, did, it, in, the, first, place, was, because, fans, wanted, it., I, would, do, stripped, down, versions, because, it, was, easier, for, in, store, appearances, or, radio, visits, or, whatever, it, may, be, but, fans, really, gravitated, towards, the, intimate, version, of, the, song, as, well, as, the, full, version., So, that, was, why, I, put, out, the, first, acoustic, EP, in, the, first, place, but, then, I, kind, of, set, this, precedent, of, putting, out, acoustic, versions, of, all, my, stuff., So, this, time, around,, I, really, wanted, to, do, something, like, that, but, with, a, different, twist, on, it, and, that’s, why, it’s, sort, of, stripped, down., It’s, these, different, versions, of, it, that, are, really, light, and, kind, of, emotive, and, cool., That, is, an, important, aspect, for, me, because, as, a, songwriter,, you, want, your, song, to, be, able, to, shine, no, matter, what, it’s, dressed, up., Whether, it’s, full, of, smoke, and, lights, and, all, the, keyboards, and, bass, and, drum, or, stripped, down, and, just, one, on, one., If, a, song, can, shine, that, way,, you, know, you, have, a, powerful, piece., I, actually, experimented, this, time, around, with, taking, the, ones, that, you, would, least, expect, to, be, turned, into, slow, versions, and, making, them, into, an, entirely, new, song., It’s, kind, of, cool, because, a, song, like, Up, We, Go,, I, think, that, was, the, one, that, had, the, biggest, transformation, because, the, full, version, is, like, an, anthem., The, stripped, down, version, becomes, this, really, sad, song, and, it’s, amazing, how, a, lyric, can, take, on, a, new, meaning., That’s, really, amazing., Yeah,, I, can’t, wait, for, people, to, hear, it., And, you’ve, been, doing, this, for, so, long., Like, you, said, you, experienced, a, pretty, severe, writer’s, block, and, you’ve, written, several, records, now., You’ve, obviously, experienced, a, lot, these, past, few, years, being, in, a, different, position, then, you, were, when, you, started, performing, as, Lights., Life, happened., Yeah, (laughs), as, it, does, with, all, of, us., Yeah,, exactly., You, grow, up, but, do, you, think, the, writing, process, even, though, you’ve, been, doing, this, for, so, long,, do, you, think, it, still, changes, sometimes?, Do, you, think, you, go, about, it, differently?, Yeah,, I, mean, I, think, ultimately, the, way, I, build, a, song, is, the, same, but, my, flexibility, with, the, different, people, I, can, write, with, or, the, different, situations, or, the, different, things, I, can, draw, from, has, evolved, and, changed, or, maybe, expanded, since, the, beginning., I, used, to, only, be, able, to, write, on, my, own, or, with, one, or, two, other, people, that, I, knew, very, closely, because, I’m, very, intimate, with, my, music, and, it, comes, from, a, very, personal, place., But, over, the, years,, you, learn, your, strengths, and, you, know, how, to, bring, that, into, a, scenario,, into, so, many, different, scenarios, and, still, be, productive, in, the, process., So, I, think, that, for, the, most, part,, the, writing, process, is, still, the, same, but, I’ve, just, learned, how, to, get, more, out, of, my, time, because, as, you, get, older,, you, have, more, responsibilities, I, guess., Certainly, and, do, you, think, it, will, still, be, a, while,, I, mean, we, talked, about, the, acoustic, record, that, you’re, doing,, but, new, material-wise., Will, it, still, be, a, while, since, you’ll, know, be, deciding, what, you, want, to, put, on, that, record,, the, direction, you, want, to, go, with?, Yeah,, I, mean, the, gap, everybody, likes, between, records, is, two, years., With, the, last, record,, it, was, three, because, I, ran, into, some, issues, but, the, hope, is, obviously, for, something, new, next, year, but, who, knows?, The, world, of, music, especially, in, terms, of, the, sales, side, of, things, and, the, consumption, of, the, music, is, changing, so, much, that, I, don’t, know, if, it, really, matters., As, long, as, you, have, stuff, there, for, people, and, that, it’s, good,, that’s, all, that, matters, to, me., I’m, not, going, to, rush, something, just, so, I, can, have, it, out, next, fall, but, that’s, always, when, people, want, something., If, it’s, ready, and, I, feel, like, it’s, right,, it, will, be, next, fall, but, who, knows., Take, your, time,, your, fans, are, pretty, dedicated., I, think, they’ll, stick, by, your, side., Yeah, and, I, feel, very, lucky., This, tour, has, proven, that, to, me, because, some, people, will, come, up, to, me, and, be, like, man,, I’ve, been, a, fan, of, you, since, the, Myspace, days, ten, years, ago, and, I’m, like, fuck, that’s, been, a, long, time., It’s, been, a, long, run., We’ve, been, going, very, strongly, and, I’m, lucky, that, this, is, my, job, and, that, I’m, still, here, and, that, some, of, these, fans, have, been, with, me, for, ten, years, and, people, have, not, left, my, side., So, it, makes, it, feel, really, amazing., That, must, be, insane, though., It’s, amazing., I, mean, you’re, obviously, a, hard, worker, and, you’ve, been, doing, this, for, a, very, long, time, to, have, the, same, fans, still, be, here., It’s, powerful., I, would, never, take, it, granted, for, any, minute., I, mean, they, invest, so, much, of, their, lives, into, what, I, do, and, I, feel, lucky, for, that., Perfect, then, to, end, it, off,, you, did, talk, obviously, earlier, about, the, acoustic, record, and, you, are, working, on, new, material, but, you, still, have, a, good, portion, to, go, in, this, run., Maybe, what’s, coming, up?, Do, you, think, you’re, going, to, keep, on, touring,, take, time, off, to, work, on, this, record?, Well,, we’re, going, to, finish, out, this, tour, which, is, about, another, month., A, little, bit, less, than, a, month., I, think, a, few, dates, are, going, to, come, in, but, we’ve, confirmed, the, Parahoy, cruise, for, March, which, is, going, to, be, amazing., Cruise, with, friends’, bands, like, X, Ambassadors,, Chvrches, and, Paramore, and, hopefully, we’ll, go, back, to, the, UK, after, that, for, a, little, bit., Then, maybe, kind, of, hunker, down, and, work, on, the, new, stuff, pretty, hard, but, yeah, there’s, still, a, bit, more, of, touring, left, to, go, even, though, we’ve, been, out, for, literally, a, year., It’s, the, power, of, the, record, I, think., It’s, something, I’m, really, proud, of, and, it’s, been, keeping, us, on, the, road, straight, so, may, as, well, keep, going, with, it!, Continue, Reading..., No, comments:, Email, ThisBlogThis!Share, to, TwitterShare, to, Facebook, Labels:, Article,, homepage,, interview,, Interviews, Young, Rival, chats, Interior, Light!, Young, Rival, A, few, days, ago,, I, was, able, to, have, a, chat, with, the, indie, rock, Canadian, band, Young, Rival, where, lead, singer, Aron, gave, me, a, in, depth, look, into, their, brand, new, record, Interior, Light., The, record, only, dropped, two, weeks, ago, on, October, 16th, and, was, their, first, record, back, after, a, brief, hiatus, for, the, band., In, this, time,, Aron, also, created, a, solo, record, but, like, Dave, Monks, talked, about, in, an, interview, with, us, it, only, allowed, him, to, have, a, new, energy, for, this, new, record, with, his, main, squeeze,, Young, Rival., The, new, record, is, definitely, a, new, move, for, the, band, but, it’s, a, great, listen, and, definitely, a, great, step, for, this, talented, trio., Currently, you, can, find, them, on, the, road, with, fellow, Canadians, Born, Ruffians, and, the, promise, is, made, to, be, back, on, the, road, very, soon., Find, our, new, one, with, Aron, below, and, definitely, pick, up, this, new, record!, I, will, always, have, a, soft, spot, for, Canadian, rock,, it’s, in, this, little, Boston, via, Montreal’s, blood., To, start, it, off,, the, three, touring, essentials, you, must, have, while, on, the, road?, I, have, to, have, my, phone, really., The, DS, is, happening,, the, boys, all, need, to, have, the, DS., I’m, pretty, easy, on, tour,, I’m, pretty, easily, entertained., I, don’t, know, if, there, are, three, things, that, I, travel, with., Then, maybe, how, has, this, time, been, going, in, the, states, with, Born, Ruffians,, obviously, a, fellow, Canadian, band, and, your, record, is, so, new., How, has, the, tour, been, so, far?, How, have, the, shows, been, so, far?, Yeah, they’ve, been, great., We’ve, been, having, a, lot, of, fun., We’re, all, good, buddies, and, traveling, together,, we’ve, been, having, a, great, time., Perfect,, and, then, the, new, record, Interior, Light, it, just, came, out, on, the, 16th., I, know, there, was, a, brief, hiatus, so, it’s, been, about, three, years, since, the, last, record., How, do, you, feel, it’s, been, going, over, even, though, it’s, so, new?, Oh, we’re, super, stoked, to, kind, of, get, it, out, there, and, to, start, pushing, it., The, hiatus, was, interesting, in, that, we, were, just, kind, of, really, dialing, in, on, what, we’re, doing,, trying, different, writing, techniques, and, really, developing, songs, a, lot, more, than, we, had, ever, before, in, the, past., So, yeah, we’re, just, really, excited, to, get, it, out, there., Get, it, rolling, and, working, hard., It’s, been, going, great., And, are, they, all, fresh, songs?, Are, some, like, from, the, past, few, years?, How, did, you, go, about, that, writing?, They’re, actually, quite, fresh,, yeah., We, kind, of, just, made, a, record, that, was, kind, of, a, contemporary, feel, for, us, personally., Yeah,, we, didn’t, really, drag, too, much, from, old, sessions, into, it., It, was, just, kind, of, like, let’s, make, a, record, together, and, develop, some, new, ideas., Come, at, this, from, a, different, angle, and, push, it., And, do, you, think, because, of, that,, the, writing, process, do, you, feel, it’s, changed?, Is, it, one, person,, more, collective?, Do, you, think, there, was, a, big, change?, The, writing, process?, The, writing, process, changed, quite, a, bit., I, ended, up, doing, a, solo, record, not, too, long, ago, and, I, learned, a, lot, about, just, developing, ideas, in, a, studio,, how, to, make, an, idea, really, come, to, fruition, and, make, sense., I, feel, like, oftentimes,, a, good, idea, can, be, lost, if, the, production, isn’t, right, and, that, can, go, both, ways, too., I, kind, of, turned, a, mediocre, idea, with, production, into, something, that, could, be, very, interesting., So, I, think, that, in, learning, more, about, how, to, achieve, certain, dynamics, in, the, studio,, we, were, able, to, kind, of, work, our, demos, in, a, new, way, where, we’d, sort, of, take, them, home, and, develop, them., Kind, of, deconstruct, them, more, and, put, them, back, together, in, a, way, that, we, had, never, done, in, the, past., We, kind, of, really, worked, the, material, in, a, way, that, we, hadn’t, done, previously., So, it’s, kind, of, a, new, way, for, us, to, go, about, writing., Just, kind, of, reeling, back, to, how, you, said, you, did, do, a, solo, album., I, interviewed, Dave, Monks, recently, obviously, from, Tokyo, Police, Club, also, being, a, Canadian, band., He, said, it, was, kind, of, therapeutic, to, do, a, solo, record., For, the, ideas, that, he, maybe, just, didn’t, feel, fit, Tokyo, Police, Club., Is, that, how, you, kind, of, approached, it,, as, kind, of, like, an, outlet?, How, was, that, experience, for, you?,  , The, solo, experience?, Yeah,, I, know, he, said, it, was, like, an, outlet, for, his, crazy., Yeah,, for, sure., I, feel, like, I, kind, of, did, it, because, I, got, to, a, point, where, I, just, needed, a, new, outlet, for, writing, because, all, the, kind, of, projects, I, was, involved, in, were, pretty, much, all, in, the, bag., Records, were, done., We, were, just, kind, of, waiting, on, release, dates, and, I, just, kind, of, took, the, opportunity, and, energy, at, the, time., I, still, felt, the, need, to, keep, pushing., I, was, feeling, that, I, needed, to, write, and, be, creative., I, find, it, hard, when, there’s, not, an, end, in, sight, to, be, creative., So, with, the, solo, record,, I, talked, to, the, guys, and, I, kind, of, wanted, to, see, how, they, would, feel, about, it, and, they, were, into, it., So, yeah,, I, just, kind, of, went, for, it., I, learned, a, ton, and, I, think, that, learning, curve, kind, of, brought, a, lot, to, where, this, new, record, kind, of, came, together., Perfect,, then, maybe, considering, the, brief, little, break, you, guys, took,, do, you, think, it, will, be, something, where, you’ll, be, back, on, tour, pretty, soon?, Maybe, even, coming, back, to, the, states, pretty, quickly,, do, you, think, it’s, still, going, to, be, a, while?, Kind, of, what’s, the, plan, for, Young, Rival?, I, think, we’re, just, going, to, try, to, keep, touring., We’re, going, to, head, over, to, Europe., We’re, going, to, push, this, record, probably, for, quite, some, time., We’ll, be, writing., I, love, writing., I, really, enjoy, that, aspect, of, being, in, a, band., It’s, probably, my, favorite, aspect., Putting, ideas, together, and, just, seeing, ideas, come, to, fruition,, you, know., So, we’re, always, writing, and, trying, to, put, together, new, ideas, but, right, now,, the, focus, is, definitely, pushing, this, record,, touring, as, much, as, possible., Perfect,, then, maybe, a, soft, one, to, kind, of, end, it, off,, for, you, time, is, obviously, a, little, crazy, right, now., The, first, CD, or, first, cassette, you, can, remember, buying, as, a, kid, then, the, first, concert, you, can, remember, going, to?, The, first, like, big, concert, I, went, to, was, strangely, enough, the, Weezer, reunion, when, they, came, back, with, the, Green, album, and, they, did, pretty, much, everything, off, the, Blue, album., It, was, amazing., I, was, in, high, school, and, was, all, about, Weezer, at, that, time, and, the, first, CD, that, I, bought, I, think, it, might, have, been, Stone, Temple, Pilots,
