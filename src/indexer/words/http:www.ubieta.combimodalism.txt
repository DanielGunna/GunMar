When, I, created, the, harmonic, school, of, Bimodalism, in, the, late, 1950s,, I, thought, it, should, have, occurred, as, a, musical, discipline, before, the, advent, of, atonality., But,, as, we, know,, it, did, not., Perhaps,, Bimodalism, should, have, been, a, middle, road, between, the, followers, and, abandoners, of, tonality., But, this, did, not, happen, either., In, retrospect,, we, can, observe, how, the, development, of, harmony, correlates, chronologically, to, the, phenomenon, of, the, harmonic, series:, As, each, period, in, music, history, came, about,, harmonic, intervals, of, sounds,, corresponding, in, order, and, pitch, to, those, of, the, series,, gradually, integrated, a, chordal, column, of, superimposed, thirds,, a, column, whose, capital, was, crowned, with, the, thirteenth, chord., Harmonic, evolution,, based, on, the, phenomenon, of, the, harmonic, series,, may, thus, be, seen, as, teleological, in, nature:, Sound, carried, within, itself, the, harmonic, components, of, the, chord,, to, be, revealed, as, representatives, of, each, period, throughout, the, history, of, music., But, regardless, of, whether, this, teleological, conjecture, is, confirmable,, the, fact, is, composers, did, progressively, superimpose, the, seven, different, sounds, carried, in, the, harmonic, series, until, they, attained, the, culmination, of, tertian, harmony., This, prompted, me, to, ask,, Why, then, did, they, not, also, superimpose, the, major, and, minor, modes, in, a, triad,, before, the, dissolution, of, tonality?, Would, this, not, have, been, the, culmination, of, tonality?, Perhaps,, composers, have, been, too, enthusiastic, to, follow, the, orientation, of, other, contemporary, schools, (such, as, the, Second, Vienna, School),, overlooking, the, possibility, of, modal, unity, that, Bimodalism, proposes., In, this, sense,, by, composing, in, bimodal, harmony,, I, believe, I, have, not, only, filled, a, hitherto, unnoticed, gap, in, music, history,, but, have, contributed, as, well, in, renewing, the, development, of, harmony, from, the, point, where, late, Impressionism, left, it., In, this, era,, where, serialist, and, polytonal, decadence, force, us, to, invent, extramusical, avant-garde, procedures,, or, lead, us, to, excavate, the, remote, pastas, the, minimalists, have, donein, search, of, magical, formulas, that, might, aerate, the, blood, of, our, contemporary, music,, the, chance, to, return, to, the, realm, of, harmony, presents, its, most, novel, and, piquant, option, in, Bimodalism., To, return, is, not, always, to, retreat,, but, sometimes, to, resume., The, essence, of, the, harmonic, discipline, of, Bimodalism, lies, in, the, simultaneous, blending, of, major, and, minor, modes, in, triads, with, the, same, fundamental, root., This, blendthe, begetter, of, a, new, ethos, in, harmonyis, applied, generally, throughout, an, entire, musical, work,, from, beginning, to, end;, or, in, sections, where, the, musical, thought, lasts, a, significant, duration, of, time;, or, in, a, symbiotic, form,, sharing, roles, with, other, existing, chordal, entities:, symbiotic, Bimodalism., (N.B., Any, attachment, to, a, bimodal, chord, nullifies, its, harmonic, effect, [ethos]:, The, polychord,, for, instance,, although, it, consists, strictly, of, bimodal, chords,, actually, loses, this, Bimodal, harmonic, effect, because, of, the, chordal, juxtaposition, of, notes, extending, beyond, the, triad., Therefore,, any, use, of, polychords, is, discarded, in, Bimodalism.), When, we, listen, to, music, in, bimodal, harmony,, we, hear, something, reminiscent, of, the, old, tonality., There, is, a, reason, for, this:, Bimodalism, forges, the, two, modes, that, characterize, western, music, since, the, seventeenth, century,, in, order, to, form, a, single, chord., It, is, precisely, the, bimodal, chord., (Although, the, bimodal, chord, does, in, fact, consist, of, four, sounds, [such, as, C-Eb-E-G],, I, will, refer, to, it, as, a, triad,, in, keeping, with, the, lexicon, of, harmony)., By, joining, major, and, minor, triads, (and, only, these, triads), of, the, same, root, on, each, degree, of, the, chromatic, scale,, we, obtain, 12, bimodal, chords, of, four, notes, with, their, three, corresponding, inversionsa, total, of, 48, chords., In, turn,, these, 48, bimodal, chordsas, each, has, 44, possibilities, of, chordal, progressions, within, the, chromatic, scaleyield, a, total, of, 2112, chordal, progressions, for, the, entire, harmonic, system,, whose, chordal, progressions, bear, a, close, tonal, interrelationship,, given, the, chordal, equality, that, Bimodalism, establishes, along, the, chromatic, scale., Consequently,, both, remote, tonalities, and, modulation, concepts, are, senseless, in, Bimodalism,, as, it, is, intrinsically, a, chain, of, 12, equivalent, and, harmonically, linked, chords,, forming,, in, fact,, a, true, unitonalityin, other, words,, a, Bimodal, chord, over, each, degree, of, the, chromatic, scale., N.B., Although, the, appearance, of, certain, harmonic, entities, throughout, contemporary, musical, history, (such, as, whole, tone, chords,, fourth, or, fifth, chords,, the, mystical, chord,, tone, clusters,, and, others), have, made, an, impression, on, our, ears,, composers, have, only, been, able, to, use, these, harmonic, entities, as, accessories, to, an, eclectic, compositional, style, (Puccini),, or, as, the, harmonic, emblem, of, a, paradigmatic, work, (Scriabin),, because, these, harmonic, entities, cannot, generate, a, rich, musical, literature, on, their, own, within, the, domain, of, tonality,, such, as, was, the, case, during, the, heyday, of, tertian, harmony., Rudiments, and, Table, of, Bimodal, Chords, FIG., 1., The, example, at, right, shows, two, notations, of, the, bimodal, chord, in, its, closest, position:, (a), as, it, should, be, written, currently;, and, (b), as, it, would, appear, if, we, were, to, use, this, accidental, sign, of, my, own, creation., I, propose, such, a, sign, for, altered, and, unaltered, notes, of, equal, name, and, placement, that, are, played, simultaneouslyin, the, case, of, the, bimodal, chord,, only, its, third., Similarly,, I, propose, that, the, third, degree, of, the, diatonic, scale, be, termed, as, modal,, despite, the, mediant, (a, merely, ordinal, term)., If, the, first, and, fifth, degrees, of, the, scale, are, denominated, by, their, tonal, function,, its, third, degree,, likewise,, should, then, be, denominated, by, its, modal, function,, since, itand, only, itdetermines, the, mode, in, music., Thus,, the, first,, third, and, fifth, degrees, of, the, scale, could, be, denominated,, tonic,, modal,, and, dominant,, respectively., FIG., 2., The, example, at, left, illustrates, Bimodal, chords, on, the, 12, degrees, of, the, chromatic, scale, in, enharmonic, notation. , Notice, how, each, chord, displays, the, double-letter, symbol, representing, the, fusion, of, both, major, and, minor, modes:, Cc,, Cc#,, Dd,, and, so, forth., They, are,, however,, to, be, referred, to, solely, by, their, root, and, (mixed), modality:, Bimodal, C,, Bimodal, C#,, and, Bimodal, D,, respectively., And, in, the, Guidonian, nomenclature:, Bimodal, Do,, Bimodal, Do#,, Bimodal, Re,, and, so, forth., (Where, you, see, the, asterisk, in, the, illustration, at, left,, note, the, following:, To, avoid, any, confusion,, I, employ, the, letters, B, and, H, as, symbols, for, the, B, flat, and, B, natural, notes,, respectively,, following, the, usage, in, German, nomenclature., Consequently,, the, bimodal, chord, over, B, flat, is, written, as, Bb,, and, the, bimodal, chord, over, B, as, Hh.), FIG., 3., The, example, below, illustrates, first,, second,, and, third, inversions, of, the, bimodal, chordclose, and, open, positions,, respectively., All, three, inversions,, including, the, defective, ones,, are, beautiful, and, well, balanced., The, first, two, inversions, (chords, of, the, sixth,, open, or, close),, however,, are, more, characteristic, of, Bimodalism, in, their, harmonic, soundscape, (the, Bimodal, ethos).,  I, have, therefore, used, them, abundantly, in, my, own, bimodal, scores,, practicing,, in, fact,, a, kind, of, bimodalized, sixth-chord, style, ("fauxbourdon").,  Click, here, to, play, Figure, 3., N.B., Where, you, see, the, asterisk, in, FIG., 3, above, (*),, please, note, that, in, Bimodalism,, the, ever-present, double, third, degree, alone, defines, unmistakably, the, identity, of, a, chord., Therefore,, you, can, omit, the, fifthand, even, the, first!degree, of, a, chord, without, losing, or, confusing, the, harmonic, identity, of, the, same, chord., This, means, you, can, easily, tell, if, the, omitted, degree, is, the, first, or, the, fifth,, once, you, find, the, the, double, third, of, the, chord., I, refer, to, this, type, of, chord, as, a, "minus-one, chord", (my, own, coinage)., FIG., 4., The, illustration, below, shows, that, in, Bimodalism, the, 12, fundamental, chordseach, with, three, corresponding, inversionsyield, a, total, of, 48, bimodal, chords., These, 48, chords,, when, multiplied, by, the, 44, possibilities, of, chordal, progressions, that, each, may, have,, yield, a, total, of, 2112, chordal, progressions, for, the, entire, system., Bimodalism, does, not, ignore, the, dynamic, law, of, tension, and, relaxation, that, rules, tonality,, as, do, both, serial, music, and, polytonality., Bimodalism,, however,, does, not, apply, this, law, through, exclusive, scalar, degrees,, depending, on, a, gravitational, center, or, tonic,, as, does, tonality., Bimodalism,, barring, the, influence, of, tonal, rules, and, its, metric, restrictions,, applies, this, law, to, a, very, free, melodic, wave, that, reveals, its, proper, points, of, tension, and, relaxation, on, any, bimodalized, chordal, degree, of, the, chromatic, scale., In, other, words,, bimodal, tonality, allows, all, sorts, of, prerogatives, in, the, syntax, of, musical, discourse., Nonetheless,, although, Bimodalism, has, expanded, the, harmonic, radius, of, tonality, to, its, limits,, this, system, can, freely, resort, to, the, most, common, chordal, progressions, of, traditional, harmony, by, way, of, Bimodalizing, its, triads., (Of, course,, you, could, also, include, nonharmonic, tones, in, bimodal, harmonizations)., In, doing, so,, we, experience, these, chordal, progressions, harmonically, attired, in, the, bimodal, style., Although, Bimodalism, is, generally, applied, to, work, on, the, degrees, of, the, chromatic, scale,, this, system, can, also, be, applied, to, any, known, or, invented, scale., In, effect,, you, can, then, form, bimodal, chords, over, the, degrees, of, any, such, scale, to, accompany, a, given, melody, by, following, the, guidelines, of, a, homophonic, style., While, we, are, on, the, subject, of, invented, scales,, I, would, like, to, propose, a, scale, that, I, have, dubbed, the, overtone, scale, (C-D-E-F#-G-A-Bb-B), because, it, encompasses, the, eight, distinct, sounds, of, the, harmonic, series, in, an, octave., With, this, scale,, we, could, stack, all, eight, sounds, thereby, creating, the, overtone, chord., This, chord, contains, a, harmonic, spectrum, consisting, of, waves, that, interfere, with, one, another,, resulting, in, a, sound, that, is, reminiscent, of, the, dominant, seventh, chord,, but, with, a, dense, and, quasi-electronic, aural, quality., I, liken, the, overtone, scale, and, overtone, chord, to, gems, whose, facets, consist, of, the, components, of, the, harmonic, series, and, that, now, shine, with, equal, relief, and, radiance., We, can, think, of, the, overtone, scale, and, chord, as, the, legacy, of, a, long, history, that, began, with, Pythagoras, and, that, culminated, with, the, birth, of, the, founding, father, of, harmony,, what, we, call, the, natural, chord., Although, Bimodalism, can, resort, to, other, chordal, entities, with, which, it, can, share, harmonic, roles,, I, advise, against, alternating, bimodal, chords, with, those, of, tertian, harmony, beyond, the, perfect, triad., Neutral, fourth, chords, can, also, play, a, compatible, role, owing, to, their, tonal, neutrality., There, is,, however,, a, specific, chord, that, can, share, the, best, harmonic, role, with, the, bimodal, chord, in, a, symbiotic, relationship:, the, major, chord, with, an, appoggiatura, without, resolution., This, non-invertible, chord, always, has, its, appoggiatura, of, second, minor, or, major, in, the, bass,, and, it, can, be, stored, in, any, of, its, close, or, open, melodic, positions, of, root,, third,, or, fifth., (The, third, position,, open, or, close,, is, the, best, balanced, of, the, three.), Although, this, chord, is, not, bimodal,, it, has, two, possibilities, to, become, a, bimodal, chord:, (1), Its, appoggiatura, can, either, be, resolved, in, a, bimodal, chord,, or, (2), its, three, upper, voices, (the, major, triad), can, serve, as, a, triple, appoggiatura, resolved, in, another, bimodal, chord, in, a, descending, movement., The, major, chord, with, an, appoggiatura, without, resolution, in, the, bass, may, owe, its, spatial, sound, identity, to, a, phenomenon, of, mere, acoustic, illusion:, We, perceive, a, sensation, of, dimensional, growth, in, this, chord, because, the, root, of, the, chord, is, elevated, only, in, the, bass, while, the, upper, major, triad, is, unchanged., (The, open, triad, position, intensifies, this, effect.), This, illusory, acoustic, phenomenon, acts, as, a, sort, of, harmonic, lever,, lifting, the, major, triad, pillar, onto, a, higher, plane, without, muddling, its, sound, identity, as, a, major, triad., Because, its, root, is, transposed, to, the, supertonic, degree,, this, chord, could, easily, be, dubbed, the, Paratonal, Major, Chord, (or, Paratonal, Chord,, for, short);, and, so,, by, virtue, of, symmetric, paratonality,, the, first, degree, of, the, triad, (in, the, bass), climbs, onto, the, second, degree, and, assumes, its, permanent, role, as, the, new, root, of, the, chord, from, that, position., Moreover,, contemporary, audiences, can, easily, withstand, a, passage, consisting, solely, of, Paratonal, Major, Chords,, owing, to, the, close, relationship, of, this, chord, with, its, originator,, the, major, chord., (This, is, yet, another, harmonic, déjà, vu, brought, about, by, Bimodalism.), FIG., 5., The, example, below, illustrates:, (1), The, major, chord, with, an, appoggiatura, without, resolution;, (2), the, major, chord, with, an, appoggiatura, resolved, in, a, bimodal, chord;, and, (3), the, major, chord, with, an, appoggiatura,, whose, three, upper, voices, are, used, as, a, triple, appoggiatura, resolved, in, another, bimodal, chord., (N.B., It, is, a, theoretical, inconsistency, to, denominate, the, major, chord, with, an, appoggiatura, without, resolution, in, the, bass, as, an, "eleventh", chord, [a, common, misconception, in, pop, music]:, A, tertian, chord,, which, is, what, an, eleventh, chord, really, is,, must, be, integrated, by, its, generic, third, degree, [the, modal], so, that, its, modality, may, be, determined., There, are, eleventh, chords,, both, major, and, minor,, but, if, they, lack, their, corresponding, third, degree,, it, is, impossible, to, determine, which, mode, they, belong, to.), For, instance,, a, minor, eleventh, chord, could, be:, C-Eb-G-Bb-D-F, [11];, whereas,, the, major,, raising, its, third,, seventh,, and, eleventh, by, one, halftone, could, be, :, C-E-G-B-D-F#, [+11]., And, the, augmented, eleventh, chord,, whose, prominent, effect, makes, it, the, ace, of, the, group,, could, be:, C-E-G-Bb-D-F#, [7+11].),  Click, here, to, play, Figure, 5., As, we, can, conclude, from, this, discussion,, an, aesthetic, aim, of, Bimodalism, is, to, evoke, tonality, in, its, most, remarkable, of, fundaments., Bimodalism, dresses, the, chordal, progressions, of, traditional, harmony, in, the, attire, of, the, bimodal, harmonic, style,, allowing, us, to, use, any, known, or, invented, scale, as, a, fertile, ground, where, bimodal, harmony, can, also, flourish., Bimodalism, also, allows, us, to, resort, to, other, chordal, entities, to, share, harmonic, roles, that, are, symbiotic, with, the, bimodal, chord., Taking, into, account, that, Bimodalism, can, be, freely, applied, with, no, previous, compositional, scheme,, we, see, how, the, bimodal, chord, can, also, generate, textures, of, an, extratonal, nature,, applying, a, procedure, of, musical, writing, of, my, own, design,, whose, aural, results, I, coined, "symmetrical, paratonalism.", (This, is, not, to, be, confused, with, the, single-term, "paratonality", as, employed, by, John, Vincent, in, his, book,, The, Diatonic, Modes, in, Modern, Music,, published, in, 1974.), My, term, defines, the, simultaneity, of, a, voice, with, its, doubling, systematically, transposed, to, another, tonality, by, only, a, major, or, minor, third,, or, by, only, a, major, or, minor, sixth., But, symmetrical, paratonalism, should, not, be, judged, as, a, procedure, of, bitonality,, when, this, sort, of, twin, paratonalism, works, within, a, homophonic, texture, of, bimodal, harmony,, without, any, adherence, to, extratonal, elements, that, may, attenuate, or, nullify, its, pure, effect,, such, as, may, sometimes, occur, in, bitonality., (Cf.:, Milhauds, "Le, boeuf, sur, le, toit", [Part, H,, from, measure, 188, through, 202])., In, applying, symmetrical, paratonalism,, music, originally, composed, for, two, voices, (e.g., melody, and, its, counterpart,, or, melodies, in, counterpoint), will, be, magnified, and, tonally, enriched:, Transpositions, and, doublings, of, every, voice, departing, from, every, note, of, a, bimodal, chord, obtain, this, effect., Thus,, the, melody, and, its, transposed, doubling, might, depart, from, two, notes, of, the, bimodal, chord,, a, third, or, sixth, apart,, whereas, the, transposed, counterpart, with, its, retransposed, doubling, depart, from, the, two, remaining, notes, of, this, chord., (Restriction:, A, symmetrical, paratonal, combination, that, originates, harmonic, intervals, of, diminished, or, augmented, octaves,, in, the, doubling, of, a, same, voice,, must, be, avoided:, It, destroys, the, aural, effect, and, ethos, of, Bimodalism)., FIG., 6A., This, illustration, shows, how, symmetrical, paratonal, writing, magnifies, and, bimodalizes, a, tonal, passage, originally, written, for, two, voices.,  Click, here, to, play, Figure, 6A., FIG., 6B., This, is, a, strict, eight-measure, canon, derived, from, the, former, theme, appearing, in, Fig., 6A., If, certain, notes,, notwithstanding,, from, symmetric, paratonal, writing, were, incompatible, with, the, Bimodal, ethos,, you, could, change, them, in, favor, of, Bimodalism., Click, here, to, play, Figure, 6B., In, addition,, a, simpler, variant, of, symmetrical, paratonalism, can, generate, a, full, bimodal, harmony, when, scales,, arpeggios,, or, broken, chords, of, identical, patterns, charmingly, transfigure, their, old, look,, as, they, depart, from, each, voice, of, a, bimodal, chord, in, parallel, motion., FIG., 7., This, illustration, below, shows, how, a, scalar, symmetrical, paratonalism, can, be, made, from, each, note, of, a, bimodal, chord., In, this, example,, the, inverted, Cc, chord, originates, and, juxtaposes, the, Eb,, G,, C,, and, E, scales., The, same, procedure, can, be, used, on, arpeggios,, broken, chords,, and, so, forth., Such, a, magnification, of, the, musical, writing, for, two, voices,, forming, symmetrical, paratonal, duos, with, harmonic, intervals, of, thirds, and, sixths, only,, places, these, traditional, consonancies, in, the, new, aural, dimension, of, Bimodalism., From, this, dimension,, they, evoke, a, singular, flavor, of, Mediterranean, idiom, that, is, as, copious, as, it, is, core, to, our, western, music., The, terms, Bimodalism, and, bitonality, are, by, no, means, interchangeable., Bitonality, (or, polytonality), is, a, contrapuntal, style, of, writing, music,, where, each, of, two, or, more, diatonic, melodies, is, written, in, a, different, tonality,, so, that, all, may, sound, simultaneously., But, because, each, melody, shares, equal, prominence,, creating, a, dissonant, field, of, voices, in, collision,, the, ear, cannot, differentiate, the, tonality, of, each, melody, nor, can, it, find, the, resulting, tonality, from, a, summation, of, combined, tonalities., This, is, evidence, that, polytonality, is,, in, fact,, atonal., The, reality, is, that, the, concurrent, function, of, various, tonalities, that, polytonality, prescribes, betrays, the, aesthetic, idea, behind, its, conception,, and, loses, the, defining, ethos, that, would, otherwise, differentiate, it, from, atonality., Only, when, two, tonalities, are, superimposed, a, tritone, apart, (such, as, C, to, F#),, and, the, counterpoint, between, them, is, carefully, treated,, can, our, ears, sense, a, certain, feeling, of, tonality,, derived, from, that, bipolar, interaction., (Bear, in, mind, that, between, the, C, and, F#, tonalities, there, are, only, two, notes, in, common:, B, and, E#, [F].), Hence,, polytonal, composers, have, so, often, used, this, bitonal, formula,, above, all,, in, the, orchestra,, where, different, plans, of, timbres, and, nuances, favor, this, stratiform, style, of, writing., In, contrast,, the, superimposition, of, major, and, minor, triads, of, a, same, tonality, (such, as, C, and, Cm), is, not, proper, of, bitonality;, if, this, were, to, occur,, it, would, be, done, following, the, technique, of, bitonality,, where, each, of, two, autonomous, melodies, would, be, written, in, a, different, mode, of, the, same, tonality,, forming, a, contrapuntal, plot, exempt, from, harmonic, ties;, in, other, words,, a, counterpoint, where, every, occurrence, of, Bimodal, harmony, would, always, be, welcome,, and, not, preceptual,, as, it, is, in, Bimodalism., Consequently,, if, two, melodies, were, written, in, separate, modes, of, a, tonality, with, no, harmonic, coupling, they, would, sound, discordant, and, turbid,, as, in, any, other, bitonal, combination., (A, rich, harmonization,, notwithstanding,, of, Bimodal, chords, over, a, basso, ostinato, of, a, specific, tonality, could, well, emulate, the, optimal, effect, of, the, well-known, Boléro.), Indeed,, when, bitonality, does, superimpose, major, and, minor, tonalities,, it, always, does, so, by, superimposing, remote, tonalities, of, different, roots, (such, as, C, and, Ebm),, whose, tonal, disparity, in, the, scalar, degrees, may, produce, the, most, contrasting, display, of, aural, plans,, which, is, the, primary, objective, of, bitonality., As, we, can, see,, case, by, case,, bitonality, differs, from, Bimodalism, as, much, in, theory, as, in, practice., Bimodalism,, in, contrast,, is, the, new, harmonic, style, of, homophony., In, it,, there, is, but, one, melody,, harmonized, with, Bimodal, triads., Notwithstanding,, Bimodalism, could, lend, itself, to, counterpoint,, provided, one, were, to, keep, the, polyphonic, texture, within, a, bimodal, harmonic, framework,, where, a, certain, sensation, of, tonality, is, always, present., This, sensation, of, tonality,, owing, to, the, fusion, of, two, modes, into, one,, may, incline, one, to, think, of, Bimodalism, as, the, maker, of, a, sort, of, neotonality,, but, never, as, an, offspring, of, bitonalityas, some, might, mistakenly, consider, it., Bimodalism,, moreover,, bears, no, resemblance, to, the, twelve-tone, technique, in, its, use, of, the, chromatic, scale., The, differences, between, Bimodalism, and, the, twelve-tone, technique, are, fundamental:, The, twelve-tone, techniqueenvisioned, by, Schoenberg, as, well, as, by, Hauerorganizes, the, 12, degrees, of, the, chromatic, scale, to, nullify, tonality., Bimodalism,, in, contrast,, builds, a, new, chord, system, on, the, same, degrees,, serving, to, restore, and, harmonically, enrich, tonality, to, its, limits., The, twelve-tone, technique, substitutes, the, melodic, strand, of, a, work, by, a, formulated, succession, of, sounds, (the, series, or, the, trope),, whose, interval, order, engenders, an, atonal, language., Bimodalism,, in, contrast,, not, only, rejects, all, forms, of, serial, composition,, but, it, also, indiscriminately, uses, any, scalar, degree, to, create, melodies, of, a, traditional, style. , To, direct, the, musical, flow, to, all, scalar, degrees, (while, ensuring, that, no, degree, assumes, greater, prominence, than, another),, one, does, not, need, to, nullify, tonality,, as, the, twelve-tone, technique, has, done., Bimodalism, can, direct, the, musical, flow, to, all, scalar, degrees, without, nullifying, tonality,, by, reducing, tonality, to, its, harmonic, quintessence:, the, bimodal, chord., By, harmonizing, each, degree, of, the, chromatic, scale, with, the, bimodal, chord,, each, degree, assumes, equal, prominence., From, this, ground,, homogeneity, (a, quality, that, is, proper, of, tonal, harmony), becomes, a, common, attribute, of, all, chordal, relationships, within, the, scale., In, other, words,, all, chordal, relationships, become, closer;, but, these, relationships, sound, even, closer,, when, they, keep, notes, in, common, or, when, they, are, formed, by, chords, whose, roots, are, separated, by, consonant, intervals, (such, as, perfect, fourths, or, fifths)., In, both, cases,, such, relationships, are, consequently, easier, for, the, ear, to, identify., In, fact,, Bimodalism, creates, a, sort, of, harmonically, equalized, unitonality,, synthesizing, modal, variety, in, the, bimodal, chord,, where, chordal, relationships, built, only, with, bimodal, chords, show, just, as, much, homogeneity, as, those, of, the, classical, tonality,, and, where, the, trace, of, all, elementary, chordal, progressions, from, the, classical, tonality, are, easy, to, follow, by, ear,, although, they, are, now, made, strictly, of, bimodal, chords., Intending, to, put, an, end, to, the, chaos, of, atonality, that, late, post-Romanticism, brought, about,, the, Second, Vienna, School, systematized, atonality, in, an, aesthetic, dogma,, whose, restrictive, rules, are, comparable, to, those, of, early, polyphony, in, history., Thus,, by, inventing, a, system, of, musical, composition,, the, twelve-tone, technique, created, the, serial, form, in, music., A, form, that, shines, like, a, lone, star,, once, tonality,, melody, and, harmony, were, extinguished, in, the, musical, sky., Soon, thereafter,, by, applying, the, serial, form, to, all, compositional, elements, in, music,, the, Second, Vienna, School, brought, this, to, its, apotheosis:, Form,, so, proclaimed, by, the, School,, is, the, most, important, matter, in, music!, As, for, serial, form,, however,, one, may, argue, that, its, perception, is, more, visual, than, aural:, When, one, reads, a, serial, music, score,, the, perception, of, its, form, is, clear, to, the, eye;, but, when, one, then, listens, to, the, same, score,, the, ear, no, longer, perceives, its, form, as, did, the, eye., On, the, contrary,, the, ear, actually, loses, all, trace, of, form,, perceiving, only, a, disordered, mass, of, sounds, in, perpetual, collision., Therefore,, is, serial, music, for, the, eye, or, for, the, ear?, More, realistically,, can, one, say, that, what, is, appealing, on, paper, is, equally, appealing, when, played?, I, think, not., The, horizontal, path, of, sounds, deliberately, chained, to, align, them, perpendicularly, with, other, parallel, sounds, either, produces, a, concordant, or, discordant, effect., If, the, result, is, concordant,, as, you, would, have, in, tonal, counterpoint,, the, form, from, the, placement, of, these, sounds, stands, out, easily, to, the, ear;, but,, if, the, result, is, discordant,, as, you, would, have, in, serial, atonalism,, the, form, (serial, or, tropal), is, overshadowed, and, the, ear, cannot, perceive, it;, the, trace, of, form, is, lost,, in, other, words., (Atonality, rendered, unintelligible, the, only, language, we, all, understood.), Hence,, the, elements, useful, in, an, aesthetic, judgment, of, mere, graphic, forms, play, no, role, in, music, by, themselves., The, ear, can, only, perceive, musical, form, acoustically, in, the, more, or, less, near, presence, of, tonality:, The, greater, the, tonal, presence,, the, greater, the, perception, of, form., Herein, lies, the, paradoxical, dilemma, of, atonalism,, where, the, musical, formthe, prime, compositional, element, to, be, judged, in, this, kind, of, musicis, actually, not, catchy, to, the, ear., This, paradox, may, have, been, signaling, over, the, decades, that, form,, in, music,, is, inherent, to, tonality., Therefore,, it, is, unwise, to, separate, form, from, tonality, as, serial, and, polytonal, music, have, done,, as, there, is, no, way, to, discern, form,, if, one, does, not, present, it, to, the, ear, within, a, certain, atmosphere, of, tonality., Perhaps,, in, lacking, tonal, sensation,, no, kind, of, atonality, has, ever, stimulated, worldwide, audiences, over, time,, although, this, style, of, music, has, been, represented, by, some, of, the, most, conspicuous, personalities, of, twentieth-century, music., Bimodalism,, contrary, to, all, mathematical, formulation, or, aleatoric, practice, in, music,, adopts, and, develops, thematic, form,, as, only, this, form, can, bring, out, the, musical, wealth, that, tonality, bequeathed, us., Therefore,, Bimodalism, has, no, place, in, serial, or, aleatoric, formulation, of, form., (Art, is, emotion:, A, work, of, art, is, merely, a, dexterous, formulation,, if, it, does, not, pour, out, from, the, fonts, of, the, subconscious,, where, emotion, is, transmuted, into, metaphorical, language.), A, musical, style, such, as, minimalism,, however,, which, marks, an, abrupt, return, to, thematic, form, within, tonality,, may, employ, bimodal, harmony, in, its, monothematic, expositions, ad, infinitum., In, fact,, Bimodalism, and, minimalism, have, two, aesthetic, principles, in, common:, Both, represent, a, reaction, against, atonality,, and, both, return, to, the, tonal, thematic, form., But, in, returning, to, tonality, and, thematic, form,, Bimodalism, and, minimalism, differ, greatly, in, their, procedures:, Minimalism, returns, to, tonality, without, reforming, it,, whereas, Bimodalism, revives, tonality, by, radically, reforming, its, harmonic, organization., Moreover,, as, minimalism, returns, to, thematic, form, without, developing, it,, Bimodalism, returns, to, all, the, forms, of, thematic, development,, rejuvenating, them, with, a, hitherto, unheard, harmonic, touch., (Perhaps,, Bimodalism, is, a, dimension, and, ethos, that, tonality, reserved, for, its, very, own, survival)., In, short,, while, the, twelve-tone, technique, and, polytonality, are, schools, of, modern, counterpoint, (aimed, at, developing, polyphonic, textures, that, nullify, tonality),, Bimodalism,, in, contrast,, is, a, harmonic, system, whose, achievement, is, to, bring, tertian, harmony, to, its, ultimate, consequence:, the, modal, unity, of, the, perfect, chord, (the, unique, harmonic, element, that, Bimodalism, uses, throughout, the, chromatic, scale)., There, have, been, sparse, instances, of, bimodal, chords, adrift, on, the, musical, ocean, of, the, twentieth, century,, either, by, modern, contrapuntal, incidence, or, for, a, sought-after, color, effect., Notwithstanding,, Pietro, Raimondis, Esempio, No.4,, from, Due, Fughe, In, Una, (1849), for, two, mixed, choruses, and, organ,, cannot, be, considered, a, case, of, early, Bimodalism, in, history,, as, the, composer, consciously, eludes, the, simultaneity, of, both, thirds, on, the, modal, degrees, of, the, work, in, question., As, Raimondi, admitted,, "Molto, difficile, mi, è, riuscito, questo, esempio,, per, causa, delle, terze, ora, maggiori,, ed, ora, minori,, secondo, le, circostanze,, onde, non, guastare, il, canto.", [This, example, has, been, quite, challenging, for, me,, first, in, handling, the, major, third,, then, the, minor,, such, that, the, singing, would, not, be, impaired, in, any, case.], His, procedure, was, ingenious:, As, one, chorus, sings, in, D, major,, the, other, sings, in, D, minor,, neither, chorus, coinciding, harmonically, in, the, modal, thirds, throughout, the, piece., Esempio, No.4, therefore, does, not, consist, of, the, simultaneity, of, the, two, modes,, chord, by, chord,, which, is, precisely, what, Bimodalism, is, about., Moreover,, we, may, not, allude, to, the, first, part, of, Stravinskys, cantata,, Le, roi, et, les, étoiles, (1911),, as, a, case, of, contemporary, Bimodalism,, as, the, principles, of, harmonic, analysis, classify, the, chord, of, the, major, and, minor, thirds, that, characterize, its, harmony,, as, a, simple, dominant, seventh, chord, with, an, augmented, ninth, added:, C-E-G-Bb-D#, or, Eb, (9+)., To, assume, that, this, latter, augmented, ninth, interval, is, the, minor, third, of, the, chord, in, question, is, theoretically, incorrect,, because, this, assumption, ignores, the, order, and, variable, qualities, of, the, chordal, degrees, in, the, tertian, harmony., Therefore,, chords, such, as, those, in, Stravinskys, cantata,, which, are, integrated, by, other, voices, beyond, the, perfect, triad,, are, not, purely, bimodal:, In, this, case,, the, presence, of, a, minor, seventh, changes, the, denomination, of, the, bimodal, triad, and, its, proper, identity, of, sound, (the, bimodal, ethos)., (It, is, worth, noting, that,, as, long, ago, as, young, Gershwin's, day,, this, augmented, ninth, chord, has, found, a, place, in, the, harmonic, palette, of, Jazz.), Stravinsky, did,, notwithstanding,, use, purely, bimodal, chords, on, occasion,, but, this, was, mostly, in, its, embryonic, phase., One, can, therefore, find, specimens, of, these, chords, scattershot, throughout, the, body, of, his, work., We, must, not, assume,, however,, that, such, a, deliberate, use, of, these, chords, within, isolated, segments, from, a, few, of, Stravinsky's, many, works, implied, an, underlying, purpose, in, developing, a, new, school, of, harmony, based, on, Bimodalism., Far, from, this,, the, ongoing, change, in, style, that, Stravinsky, experimented, with, throughout, his, careerbe, it, polytonalism, , pandiatonicism,, neoclassicism,, or, even, Webernian, serialism, (to, which, he, was, lately, inducted)clearly, demonstrates, that, these, meant, nothing, more, than, a, mere, compositional, resource, at, the, service, of, his, aesthetic, thinking., As, far, as, I, know,, a, prototypical, work,, deliberately, written, to, represent, Bimodalism,, has, never, been, published, or, mentioned, in, the, accredited, literature, of, music., But, even, if, such, a, paradigm, were, to, exist, as, an, isolated, laboratory, experiment,, it, would, in, no, way, cast, a, shadow, over, the, value, and, originality, of, this, invention:, to, create, a, harmonic, system, that, gives, music, a, new, dimension, and, ethos, embodied, in, Bimodalism., If, some, bimodal, work, did, exist, previously,, rather, we, ought, to, agree, with, Goethe, that,, once, again,, "future, events, cast, their, shadows, in, advance.", In, light, of, this, sense, of, forecasting,, we, must, recall, that, four, centuries, ago,, Luca, Marenzio, (1553-1599), and, Carlo, Gesualdo, (1560-1613), independently, wrote, madrigals, that, could, have, been, written, by, a, Richard, Strauss;, as, for, Hans, Neusiedler's, (1508-1563), work,, Der, Juden, Tanz, (The, Jews, Dance),, there, are, numerous, records, in, the, seventeenth, century, where, the, police, of, Prague, leveled, charges, against, Jewish, musicians, for, improperly, playing, "scales,, modes,, and, functional, harmony", in, this, dance,, which, prompts, us, to, file, this, work, among, the, earliest, cases, of, modern, bitonality,, and, not, as, a, case, of, scordatura;, both, Chopin, and, Liszt,, each, intending, to, expand, tonality,, wrote, ostensible, passages, in, a, frank, atonality;, Giovanni, Battista, Vitali, (1644-1692), fully, constructed, the, cyclical, form, of, the, sonata,, two, centuries, before, César, Franck, accomplished, it, in, his, Sonata, in, A, for, piano, and, violin;, it, is, Ernest, Fanelli, (1860-1919),, not, Debussy,, who, we, should, acknowledge, as, the, father, of, musical, Impressionism,, upon, hearing, his, Tableaux, Symphoniques, (1882), recently, recorded, on, compact, disc;, the, unfairly, forgotten, Pietro, Raimondi, (1786-1853), deliberately, and, systematically, wrote, an, ingenious, collection, of, fugues, in, four, and, six, simultaneous, tonalities,, apart, from, his, Three, Oratorios, In, One,, juxtaposing, contrary, tempos, and, meters,, long, before, Milhaud,, Prokofiev,, Bartók, (or, even, Ives), began, to, experiment, with, polytonality, and, Stravinsky,, Carter,, and, Blacher,, with, polymeter,, metric, modulation, and, variable, meters,, respectively;, the, virtuoso, pianist, Charles, Kunkel, (1840-1923), used, a, tone, cluster, effect, in, his, work,, Alpine, Storm, (1888),, before, Charles, Ives, used, this, effect, in, 1911, in, the, second, movement, of, his, Concord, Sonata,, and, before, Henry, Cowell, , its, principal, user, , coined, the, term, in, 1915;, a, Clavecin, Oculaire,, invented, in, 1734, by, Louis-Bertrand, Castell, (1688-1757),, preceded, by, almost, two, centuries, the, synaesthetic, inventions, of, sound, and, color, that, Scriabin, exhibited, in, his, Prometheus, (1910);, microtonality,, since, its, extinction, in, Greek, antiquity,, reemerged, systematized, by, the, astronomer, Christiaan, Huygens, (1629-1695), in, his, Tricesimorprimal, Temperament,, many, times, before, Jacques, Halévy, practiced, microtonality, in, his, cantata,, Prométhee, Enchaîné, (1847),, and, before, Richard, Stein, (1882-1942),, Alois, Hába, (1893-1973),, and, Julián, Carrillo, (1875-1965), with, his, Sonido, 13,, made, their, first, experiments, fractionalizing, the, octave, into, several, microtones, of, different, values;, as, history, now, sheds, light,, it, was, Charles, Ives, (1874-1954),, who, first, used, a, twelve-tone, row,, before, J., M., Hauer,, Schoenberg, and, Jefim, Golyscheff, were, to, divulge, their, own, serial, techniques, amid, a, paternity, contest, claiming, credit, for, the, idea, itself;, in, 1914,, Erik, Satie, instructed, that, sheets, of, paper, be, inserted, between, piano, strings, in, Le, piège, de, Méduse,, and, Rued, Langgaard, (1893-1952), instructed, that, a, glissando, be, played, on, the, piano, strings, in, Sfaerernes, musik, (1918),, before, John, Cage, (following, Cowells, experiments,, respectively), could, have, embodied, all, these, ideas, in, his, Prepared, Piano, or, Klaviergamelan, (1940),, whose, industrialization, and, universality, were, owing, to, the, inventions, by, its, performer, and, promoter,, Richard, Bunger, (q.v.:, Bungerack,, Pianotation,, and, so, forth);, in, his, work,, Das, Eisige, Lied, (The, Icy, Song),, and, in, his, opera,, Cyrano, de, Bergerac,, the, Dadaist, Jefim, Golyscheff, (1897-1970), employed, a, noisy, collection, of, domestic, objects,, three, decades, before, Pierre, Schaeffer, (1910-1995), would, formulate, his, theory, of, musique, concrète, in, 1948;, Ravel's, Boléro, (1928), should, be, considered, the, true, forerunner, of, minimalism,, a, work, that, features, all, the, components, of, this, style;, 12, years, before, George, Crumb, premiered, his, work,, Ancient, Voices, of, Children, (1970),, I, created, musical, vocal, effects, by, sympathetic, resonance, within, a, piano,, in, my, incidental, music, composed, for, Jean, Anouilh's, drama,, Roméo, et, Jeanette,, performed, at, the, Fine, Arts, Palace, of, Havana;, and, that, Mozart, , two, centuries, after, Der, Juden, Tanz, had, materialized, , not, only, added, to, the, dossier, on, bitonality, as, initiated, in, that, dance, with, his, own, Ein, Musikalischer, Spaß,, but, once, again,, amusing, himself,, threw, the, dice, to, vary, the, numerical, order, of, a, group, of, written, measures,, long, before, John, Cage,, Karlheinz, Stockhausen,, Pierre, Boulez,, and, many, other, composers, were, to, write, aleatoric, music, in, our, day., The, challenging, character, of, these, historic, events,, however,, should, not, alter, our, wise, evaluation, of, the, matter, at, hand:, In, art,, the, paternity, of, an, aesthetic, idea, is, not, consequently, attributed, to, who,, by, hazard, or, by, genius,, originates, the, essence, of, the, idea,, but, to, who, , regardless, of, claims, to, origination, , develops, the, idea, to, its, consecration., Indeed,, ever, since, I, wrote, several, works, employing, this, harmonic, element, as, an, aesthetic, principle, of, musical, composition,, Bimodalism, has, finally, developed, into, and, become, a, recognizable, system, with, its, own, identity,, as, a, new, world-class, school, of , contemporary, harmony., Let, history, put, everything, in, its, place.,  Click, here, to, listen, to, a, complete,, albeit, brief,, composition, in, bimodal, harmony., Click, above, for, my, digital, guitar, recording, of, The, Sleepless, Street., This, is, a, work, for, solo, classical, guitar, written, entirely, in, bimodal, harmony., I, composed, it, to, pay, homage, in, dance, form, to, the, many, jazz, clubs, that, existed, along, New, York's, West, 52nd, Street, from, the, 1930s, to, the, 1950s., One, of, my, master, class, composition, students,, Peter, Corey,, was, also, an, accomplished, classical, guitarist,, and, in, 1984, he, premiered, this, work, at, Merkin, Concert, Hall., Allen, Hughes, of, the, New, York, Times,, who, reviewed, it, back, then,, felt, it, was, a, pretty, little, piece, with, mildly, piquant, dissonance, deriving, from, bimodal, treatment., I, wish, to, point, out, that, The, Sleepless, Street, is, only, one, of, several, compositions, I've, written, in, bimodal, harmony., I, chose, it, as, an, example, for, this, web, page, because, its, homophonic, simplicity, unmistakably, highlights, the, harmonic, novelty, of, Bimodalism., As, time, permits,, I, intend, to, add, other, examples, consisting, of, chamber, and, orchestral, works, to, showcase, Bimodalism, with, a, greater, complement, of, compositions., Melody, is, an, outline;, harmony, is, a, mass;, rhythm, is, a, motion...Music, is, the, outline, of, a, mass, in, motion., -Enrique, Ubieta,  , |,
