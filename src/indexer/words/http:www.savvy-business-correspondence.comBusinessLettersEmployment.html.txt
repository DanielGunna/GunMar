[Business, Letters:, Employment, See, Business, Letters, Related, to, Job, Search, Page, Dixie, would, like, to, continue, here, the, topic, of, business, letters, related, to, job, search, and, employment., The, first, letter, on, this, page,, a, thank, you, after, the, interview, letter,, is, practically, the, last, letter, an, applicant, needs, to, write, before, getting, a, job,, and, then, below, you, will, find, a, job, offer,, an, employment, verification, and, a, resignation, letter,, as, you, see, they, all, are, related, to, employment, issues., Thank, You, Letters, Dixie, would, like, to, draw, to, your, attention, that, according, to, the, statistical, data, only, 36%, of, job, hunters, interviewed, regularly, send, thank, you, notes, after, the, interview,, while, 75%, of, employers, appreciate, or, expect, the, notes., According, to, some, other, statistics,, 22%, of, hiring, managers, are, less, likely, to, hire, a, job, candidate, if, he, or, she, doesn't, send, a, thank, you, note, after, an, interview., Failure, to, follow, up, can, be, the, deciding, factor, in, rejecting, a, candidate, who, might, otherwise, have, been, hired., Dixie, will, be, delighted, if, you, use, the, sample, below, to, write, a, thank, you, letter., And, Dixie, would, like, you, to, remember, the, following, rule, about, sending, a, thank, you, letter, after, the, interview:, Never, ever, text, the, thank, you, note., It, is, fine, nowadays, to, do, it, by, email, in, a, lot, of, cases,, but, texting, is, definitely, a, no-no., Job, Offer, You, are, hired!, Congratulations!, That's, what, any, job, seeker, would, like, to, hear,, even, Dixie, has, been, in, a, similar, situation, a, couple, of, times., So, below, she, offers, to, your, attention, a, sample, job, offer, letter., Job, search, is, over, for, you, at, last!, Employment, and, Salary, Verification, Letter, Most, of, the, letters, above, have, been, related, to, job, search., Dixie, would, like, to, let, you, know, that, the, letter, below,, Employment, Verification, Letter, is, in, most, cases, used, for, a, different, purpose., Though, in, some, rare, cases, a, hiring, company, may, ask, a, potential, candidate, for, such, letter, as, a, proof, of, their, current, employment,, but, mostly, Employment, and, Salary, Verification, Letters, are, used, when, an, employee, is, applying, for, a, loan,, mortgage,, or, making, a, major, purchase, on, credit., Dixie, would, like, to, add, that, employers, are, supposed, to, write, a, Salary, Verification, Letter,, but, in, most, cases, employees, create, such, a, letter, themselves,, including, or, leaving, out, the, salary, information, (which, Dixie, has, not, included, in, her, sample, below),, and, ask, their, employer, to, sign, it., Dixie, asks, you, to, note, that, addressing, an, Employment, Verification, Letter, To, Whom, It, May, Concern, is, totally, appropriate, according, to, accepted, business, practices., Resignation, Letter, So,, it's, time, for, a, resignation, letter,, Dixie, says., It, turns, out,, there, are, not, that, many, letters, related, to, job, search, and, employment, one, needs, to, write, in, his, or, her, life, if, Dixie, was, able, to, summarize, them, all, on, two, pages, (see, Page, 1, for, Job, Search, Letters)., She, would, like, you, to, remember, two, major, points, about, resignation, letters:, 1), give, verbal, notification, of, your, resignation, to, your, boss, first,, preferably, two, weeks, in, advance, and, then, follow, up, with, a, confirmation, resignation, letter, 2), it's, very, important, to, keep, letters, of, resignation, positive, -, always, leave, friends, behind,, not, enemies., See, a, sample, of, a, resignation, letter, below:, Need, help, with, your, job, search?, Dixie, would, like, to, bring, to, your, attention, a, unique, book, on, finding, a, job, (not, just, searching, for, one),, a, #1, best, seller, on, Amazon,,
