[Last, update:, 2014-03-12, ...read, the, latest, news..., Welcome, to, the, Java, Movie, Database, latest, PRE-RELEASE:, 1.40, pre-release, 2+, (available, since, 2014-03-11, -, ...which, allows, to, import, the, IMDb, files, again...), -->, JMDB, 2, Development:, planning/prototyping, (more, or, less, on, hold), -, extending, JMDB, 1.x, to, re-use, existing, code, Follow, JMDB, development, progress, on, Twitter, or, look, into, the, News, section..., What, is, JMDB?, Java, Movie, Database, is, a, Java-based, application, to, search, for, information, about, movies,, actors,, actresses,, producer,, director, and, everything, related, to, those., It's, planned, that, JMDB, will, be, an, open, source, project, in, future,, that, means, that, the, source, code, will, then, be, available., The, information, is, basically, the, same, as, you, can, get, when, using, the, IMDb, website., Currently, (7th, March, 2014), it, counts, over, 2.828.000, movies, (including, TV-Shows, with, their, episodes), and, over, 2.965.000, actors/actresses, in, total, (actors=1.915.895/actresses=1.049.133)., Back, in, 1999, we, began, with, a, little, more, than, 300.000, movies, and, 600.000, actors, and, actresses, in, total, (see, the, IMDb, data, development, chart, below)., Beside, this, base, data, about, movies, and, performer, there, is, a, lot, of, other, data, available, and, supported, by, the, Java, Movie, Database, application, like, plots,, biographies,, ratings,, goofs, and, much, more., A, detailed, list, of, supported, information, can, be, found, below, as, well, as, a, list, of, unsupported, data., Here, you, see, a, chart, showing, the, increasement, of, movie, plus, actors, and, actresses, since, 1999., Between, 2005-11-11, and, 2006-02-03, you, see, a, major, increase, of, movies, in, a, very, short, period, of, time., This, was, the, time, when, the, Internet, Movie, Database, began, to, handle, episodes, of, series, as, movies., The, difference, between, the, IMDb, and, JMDB, is,, that, the, Java, Movie, Database, is, an, alternative, way, to, navigate, through, this, information., It, can, be, run, on, a, stand-alone, PC, just, as, in, a, network, environment., Another, advantage, is, that, you, can, write, your, own, programs, and, scripts, to, use, the, locally, installed, database, (see, the, cinema, program, list, at, my, personal, website, http://www.juergen-ulbts.de/), and, with, JMDB2, webservices, are, planned!, The, JMDB, will, import, the, IMDb, textfiles, (also, called, IMDb, list, files), into, the, database, system, for, you., The, About, JMDB, page, contains, some, pictures, and, the, Using, JMDB, page, features, even, more, details, (incl., Flash, demos)., To, use, JMDB,, you, only, need, a, Java, Runtime, Environment, and, the, database, MySQL, or, PostgreSQL,, which, means, that, you, can, run, it, on, most, platforms,, including, Windows,, Linux,, Mac OS X,, any, Unix,, eComStation, (eCS), and, OS/2., It, is, planned, to, support, more, databases, like, SQLite,, HSQLDB, and, some, other, in, the, future., Here, is, a, complete, list, of, the, supported, information, provided, by, the, Internet, Movie, Database, (sorted, by, name):, Actors, Actresses, AKA-Names, AKA-Titles, Alternate-Versions, -, (will, be, supported, by, JMDB, v1.40, and, later, -, included, in, JMDB, v1.40,

by, the, Java, Movie, Database., The, last, MovieID, list, has, been, created, end, of, April, 2009, and, so, far, it's, not, clear, when, or, if, there, will, be, an, update., I, got, the, tools, to, update, it, myself, in, December, 2009, but, so, far, I, didn't, do, it., Currently, available, but, unsupported, data, (sorted, by, name):, Complete-Cast, -, (doesn't, make, sense, to, support, as,
