This, is, not, a, guide, to, choosing, the, best, password, in, the, world,, and, protecting, it, like, it's, your, PIN, number, or, your, life., We, realize, that, if, you, had, to, pick, unique,, extra-long,, extra-strong, passwords,, for, all, the, systems, you, use,, and, change, them, very, regularly,, and, couldn't, write, them, down..., that, you'd, go, insane., But,, that's, no, excuse, for, using, the, name, of, your, dog,, 'password',, or, a, string, of, expletives, with, a, 1, on, the, end., If, anything, in, this, document, is, unclear,, or, it, takes, you, more, than, a, few, minutes, to, read, it,, digest, it,, and, come, up, with, a, good, new, password,, let, us, know,, as, it, obviously, needs, to, be, made, more, simple., What, you, Should, Not, be, Doing, Most, people, are, aware, of, the, most, obvious, choices, of, password, (if, you, are, using, the, names, of, any, of, your, family,, please, change, your, password, now!), However,, because, of, the, availability, of, automated, password-cracking, programs,, you, should, also, avoid, the, following:, Any, word, which, appears, in, a, dictionary, (including, highly, technical, words, from, your, own, discipline.), Common, first, names,, your, surname,, names, of, pets, and, literary, characters,, dates, of, birth., Your, editor, name, or, car, registration, number., Passwords, of, less, than, eight, characters, (shorter, passwords, are, easier, to, crack.), Any, dictionary, word, slightly, modified, (e.g., by, adding, a, number, to, the, end,, or, changing, l, to, 1.), Simple, sequences, such, as, QWERTY,, LETMEIN,, the, name, of, your, department, or, group,, or, an, obvious, name, spelled, backwards., What, you, Should, be, Doing, A, recommended, technique, for, choosing, passwords, which, are, hard, to, crack, but, possible, to, remember, is:, Choose, a, short, sentence, or, phrase, which, makes, sense, to, you, (but, is, not, a, common, saying, or, proverb),, use, its, initial, letters, and, insert, a, number, or, punctuation, (preferably, both), somewhere, in, the, string., Note, that, you, can, mix, upper, and, lower, case, to, make, any, passwords, harder, to, crack., Important, For, passwords,, DMOZ, requires, a, minimum, of, eight, (8), characters, and, maximum, of, 16, characters,, at, least, one, (1), letter,, and, at, least, one, (1), non-letter, character, (this, can, be, a, numeral, or, any, ASCII, special, character)., If, you, have, an, 8-16, character, password,, which, contains, at, least, any, three, of, upper, case,, lower, case,, numbers, and, special, characters,, and, which, doesn't, look, like, a, word, or, your, username,, you're, probably, doing, well, enough., Aim, for, that., Make, every, effort, never, to, share, your, password, with, anyone., If, it's, written, down,, make, sure, it's, not, for, public, consumption, on, the, bathroom, wall., Don't, save, your, password, on, a, public, computer,, or, a, computer, whose, administrator, you, do, not, trust., Do, not, tell, anyone,, including, DMOZ, metas,, administrators,, and, staff,, your, password,, even, if, they, request, it., (Please, notify, the, DMOZ, administrative, team, if, anyone, does, request, your, password,, however, convincing, their, need, sounds.), Use, a, different, password, for, each, of, dmoz.org,, ODP::Passport,, Resource-Zone,, and, editor-produced, tools., Never, supply, any, of, these, passwords, to, a, third, party, or, editor-produced, tool,, however, attractive, the, features, of, the, tool, are., (Please, notify, the, DMOZ, administrative, team, of, any, third, party/editor-produced, tool, that, requests, these, passwords.), The, DMOZ, editor, forums, use, the, same, password, as, your, editor, account,, but, they, synchronize, after, several, hours., If, after, a, few, hours, you, still, can't, access, the, fora,, let, us, know., Any, passwords, that, you, use, for, DMOZ, systems, should, be, different, to, all, other, systems., If, you, want, to, use, the, same, password, for, the, dozens, of, news, sites, that, make, you, register, to, read, the, headlines,, please, go, right, ahead,, but, don't, use, the, same, password, for, DMOZ,, as, we, do, have, data, that, should, not, be, shared,, and, if, it, gets, leaked, under, your, user, account,, it's, your, responsibility., Never, re-use, an, old, password,, ever., Never, use, a, password, given, as, an, example, of, a, password., Never, use, an, online, password, generator, or, pick, a, password, from, a, list, online., Avoid, emailing, passwords,, and, never, store, them, in, your, mailbox., If, in, doubt, change, your, password., Last, update:, Sun, Jul, 10, 17:18, EDT, 2016, Copyright, ©, 2016, AOL, Inc., (Terms, of, Use, -,
