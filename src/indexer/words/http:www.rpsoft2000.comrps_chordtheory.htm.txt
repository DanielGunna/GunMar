scale. , Let, us, use, the, key, of, C, for, our, scale, since, that, will, yield, simplest, results. , A, scale, is, generally, taken, as, 8, notes,, which, is, also, considered, one, �octave�. , The, scale, begins, on, a, note, and, ends, when, it, reaches, that, same, type, of, note. , Let, us, look, at, a, simple, C, scale, looking, at, it, three, different, ways:, Scale,, Key, of, C, to, a, Singer, Do,, re,, mi,, fa,, so,, la,, ti,, do! , (note, that, it, has, 8, notes,, and, begins, and, ends, on, �do�), Scale,, Key, of, C, by, name, C,, D,, E,, F,, G,, A,, B,, C, (8, notes, again,, and, begins, and, ends, on, C), Scale,, Key, of, C, by, number, 1,, 2,, 3,, 4,, 5,, 6,, 7,, 8 , (8, notes, again,, but, this, time, we, called, the, 8th, note, 8), The, above, three, representations, are, all, really, the, same. , How, do, we, use, this, for, chords? , Well, let, us, start, with, a, simple, major, chord. , A, major, chord, is, always, made, up, of, the, first,, 3rd,, and, 5th, notes, of, its, scale. , So, C, Major, is, simply, C,, E,, and, G. , Not, so, hard,, eh?, What, would, a, sixth, be? , Can, you, guess? , Well, we, begin, with, a, major, chord,, and, then, add, the, sixth, note. , So, a, major, sixth, (normal, sixth), would, be:, C,, E,, G,, A., Chromatic, Scales, Now, the, C, scale, above, is, not, all, of, the, possible, notes. , It, is, merely, the, 8, notes, making, up, the, C, scale. , If, we, think, in, terms, of, a, piano,, the, C, scale, is, all, of, the, white, keys. , It, does, not, use, any, of, the, shorter, black, keys,, which, are, sharps, and, flats. , When, we, look, at, all, of, the, possible, notes,, we, call, that, a, chromatic, scale. , All, of, the, possible, notes, in, a, chromatic, scale,, not, counting, any, repeats,, not, even, one,, are, 12, total. , They, are:, C,, C#,, D,, D#,, E,, F,, F#,, G,, G#,, A,, A#,, B,, (and, then, C, would, repeat, next), Of, course,, that, shows, the, chromatic, scale, using, all, sharps. , A, sharp, sign, #, means, to, raise, a, tone, one, half, step. , So, C#, is, one, half, step, higher, than, C. , For, every, sharp, representation,, there, is, also, a, flat, representation, possible. , Instead, of, raising, C, one, half, step, to, get, C#,, we, could, have, also, lowered, D, one, half, step, to, get, a, Db. , The, �b�, sign, is, for, �flat�, just, as, the, �#�, sign, is, for, sharp. , C#, is, the, same, note, as, Db. , There, are, just, two, ways, of, showing, it. , Sometimes, it, s, more, convenient, to, show, it, as, a, sharp,, and, sometimes, as, a, flat., Minor, chords,, Dominant, 7ths, It, was, necessary, to, talk, about, chromatic, scales, before, talking, about, some, chords,, such, as, minors, and, dominant, 7ths,, since, they, go, off, of, the, normal, C, scale, and, involve, half, steps. , We, had, said, that, a, major, chord, was, made, up, of, the, first,, third, and, fifth, notes, of, the, scale,, C,, E, and, G. , A, minor, is, close,, but, it, �flats�, the, third. , So, a, C, minor, chord, would, be: , C,, Eb,, G. , Note, that, we, could, have, shown, this, also, as: , C,, D#,G, since, D#, and, Eb, again, are, the, same, note., When, we, talk, about, 7th, chords,, one, would, think, that, we, take, a, major, chord, such, as, C,E,, and, G,, and, add, the, seventh, note, of, the, scale,, which, would, be, �B�. , That, in, fact, is, exactly, what, we, do, for, a, C, major, 7th, chord. , However,, when, we, just, write, 7th,, it, is, taken, to, mean, a, �dominant, 7th�, which, flats, the, 7th, note. , So,, C, 7th, is:, C,, E,, G,, and, Bb. , This, again, can, also, be, written, as, C,, E,, G,, A#., So,, the, above, covers, the, 7th, chord., The, C, major, 7th, chord, would, in, fact, be, what, you, would, have, guessed: , C,, E,, G,, B, -, where, B, is, clearly, the, 7th, note, of, the, scale. , Now,, how, about, a, minor, 7th, chord? , Let, us, begin, with, the, minor,, which, flats, the, third,, and, then, add, the, 7th. , So,, let, us, begin, with, C, minor, which, is, C,, Eb,, G, and, we, will, add, the, 7th, which, again, is, Bb, and, we, get: , C,, Eb,, G,, Bb. , Recall, that, when, we, just, say, �7th�, it, refers, to, the, dominant, 7th,, which, is, a, flatted, 7th, of, the, scale. , There, is, a, version, of, a, minor, chord, that, uses, the, major, 7th,, it, is, called, mmaj7th. , It, is, a, somewhat, confusing, name,, being, a, minor,, major7th. , I, would, agree, that, minor-major, in, the, same, sentence, seems, like, a, contradiction, of, terms,, but, they, refer, to, two, different, parts, of, the, chord. , The, minor, refers, to, the, first, three, notes,, C, Eb,, G. , The, major, 7th, means, that, we, do, not, flat, the, 7th, note, of, the, scale. , So,, therefore, a, C, mmaj7th, would, be: , C,, Eb,, G,, B., More, Well,, if, you, follow, all, of, that,, many, of, the, rest, of, the, chords, should, make, sense. , An, augmented, chord, is, also, called, a, +, chord,, or, a, +5, chord. , You, can, probably, guess, what, that, chord, does. , It, raises, the, fifth, note, of, the, scale, one, half, step. , So, a, C, major, chord, again, is, C,, E,, and, G,, which, are, the, first,, third, and, fifth, notes, of, the, scale. , So,, a, +5, would, cause, the, chord, to, become, C,, E,, G#., On, the, other, hand, there, is, a, -5, chord. , So,, a, C-5, would, be, C,, E,, Gb, or, C,, E,, F#., One, strange, �chord�, is, simply, called, a, �5�. , It, really, is, only, two, notes,, the, first, and, the, the, fifth, of, the, scale. , So,, a, C5, is, merely, C, and, G. , Note, that, this, chord, is, also, sometimes, called, C, major, no, 3rd. , Can, you, see, that? , If, C, major, is, C,, E,, G,, then, C, major, with, no, 3rd, is, simply, C, and, G., 9ths,, 11ths, and, 13ths, are, somewhat, understandable,, but, they, do, add, some, confusion. , The, understandable, part, is, that, they, do, in, fact, add, the, note, that, one, would, think. , They, also, add, a, few, more, however. , But, let, us, start, with, the, reasonable, part. , A, C, 9th, would, add, a, �D�, as, one, might, expect, -, the, ninth, note, in, the, scale. , A, C, 11th, does, add, an, �F�,, the, 11th, note, in, the, scale,, and, a, C, 13th, does, add, an, �A� , which, is, the, 13th, note, in, the, scale. , However,, C9th, also, adds, a, dominant, 7th, and, therefore, is:, C,, E,, G,, Bb,, D. , The, 11th, adds, not, only, the, dominant, 7th, but, also, the, 9th, and, therefore, is: , C,, E,, G,, Bb,, D,, F. , The, 13th, is, similar, to, the, 11th, and, becomes: , C,, E,, G,, Bb,, D,, A., The, minor, versions, of, 9th,, 11th, and, 13th? , They, really, follow, the, same, formula, but, begin, with, the, minor, rather, than, the, major, chord. , So, C, minor, 9th, is: , C,, Eb,, G,, Bb,, D., Scales, /, Chords, other, than, C, If, the, above, makes, sense, to, you,, you, are, getting, close, to, understanding, the, basic, make, up, of, chords. , Some, is, simple, mathematics,, and, some, is, convention,, established, years, ago. , Of, course, you, could, say, that, all, this, is, in, the, scale, and, key, of, C. , Other, keys, are, harder. , Well,, yes, and, no. , The, other, keys, may, have, odder, looking, sequencing,, but, they, follow, all, of, the, same, rules. , This, is, where, the, mathematics, come, in. , To, look, at, a, D, scale,, for, example,, note, that, a, D, is, two, half, steps, in, the, chromatic, scale, higher, than, C. , Use, that, then, to, calculate, all, of, the, notes, of, the, D, scale. , Doing, that, a, D, scale, is:, D,, E,, F#,, G,, A,, B,, C#,, D, A, D, major, chord, is, still, the, first,, third, and, fifth, of, the, scale,, and, is: , D,, F#,, A., D, minor, is, similar, with, the, third, �flatted�, and, would, be:, D,, F,, A., D, 7th, would, be, D,, F#,, A,, C, since, flatting, C#,, the, 7th, note, in, the, D, scale, is, really, just, C., D, major, 7th, would, be, D,, F#,, A,, C# , (the, 1st,, 3rd,, 5th, and, 7th, notes, of, the, scale), Summary, If, you, understand, the, above,, you, may, in, fact, be, able, to, even, figure, out, some, of, the, unique, chords, that, guitar, players, continue, to, come, up, with. , I, just, noted, a, new, one, in, one, of, my, song, books. , It, was, a, D, major, add, 2. , What? , we, might, say? , But, then, we, would, get, a, grip, on, ourselves., We, would, put, together, the, D, major, chord, of, D,, F#, and, A,, and, then, merely, add, the, 2nd, note, of, the, scale,, an, E. , Then, we, would, get, D,, E,, F#,, A. , Voila, ! , See? , not, so, bad., If, you, are, like, me, and, appreciate, the, mathematics,, but, then, have, a, hard, time, memorizing, 28, chords, versus, 12, notes, of, the, chromatic, scale,, 336, possibilities. , And, even, less, likely, to, memorize, the, guitar, fingerings, for, those, 336, down, 12, frets, making, 4032, possibilities,, then, you, might, need, a, simple, aid. , The, software, program, being, marketed, by, rpsoft,
