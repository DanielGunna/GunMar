Awards,, an, American, Music, Award, and, an, Oscar, nomination., As, Deniece, reflects, "I, wasn't, really, thinking, about, making, a, new, record, until, a, mutual, friend, put, me, in, touch, with, Bobby,, who, I, knew, from, the, recording, sessions, I, did, with, Thom, Bell, in, the, early, '80s, which, included, songs, like, "Silly", and, "It's, Gonna, Take, A, Miracle.", Bobby, talked, to, me, about, the, idea, of, doing, a, project, of, songs, that, I've, always, loved., I, thought, it, was, a, great, way, to, honor, artists, like, Luther, Vandross,, Donny, Hathaway, and, Gwen, Guthrie, and, what, their, music, has, meant, to, me., When, people, listen, to, this, project,, I, hope, it, will, take, them, back, down, memory, lane, as, well, as, create, new, memories, for, those, who, may, not, be, familiar, with, all, the, songs, on, the, album.", Within, weeks, of, agreeing, to, Love,, Niecey, Style,, Bobby, Eli, (whose, extensive, production, credits, include, such, favorites, as, Sister, Sledge,, Atlantic, Starr,, Major, Harris,, Blue, Magic, and, Engelbert, Humperdink, and, whose, discography, includes, countless, Philly, soul, sessions, as, a, star, guitarist, with, Billy, Paul,, The, Spinners,, Wilson, Pickett,, The, Salsoul, Orchestra,, The, O'Jays,, MFSB,, The, Temptations, and, Elton, John), and, Deniece, had, begun, selecting, songs, for, it., "There, were, so, many, songs, I, had, been, carrying, around, forever,, humming, them,, singing, them, and, never, thinking, I, would, be, recording, them!", she, declares., "By, the, time, we, finished,, I, felt, we, had, done, what, we, set, out, to, do.", For, Eli,, working, with, Deniece, was, "a, pure, pleasure., She's, a, producer's, dream,, a, very, special, artist, and, someone, I, always, wanted, to, work, with, from, being, on, the, Thom, Bell, sessions, with, her.", Love,, Niecey, Style, is, particularly, special,, given, the, presence, of, three, distinguished, music, men, who, have, played, an, integral, role, in, Deniece's, career, at, different, times:, icon, Stevie, Wonder, (with, whom, Deniece, got, her, first, gig, as, a, member, of, his, touring, backup, vocal, group, Wonderlove, in, 1972);, super, producer,, songwriter, and, artist, in, his, own, right,, George, Duke, (who, produced, 1984's, Grammy-winning, "Let's, Hear, It, For, The, Boy");, and, renowned, vocalist, Philip, Bailey,, of, Earth,, Wind, &, Fire,, with, whom, Deniece, was, associated, by, virtue, of, working, with, EW&F's, Maurice, White, and, Kalimba, Productions, from, 1976, to, 1982., In, addition,, what, distinguishes, Niecy's, new, CD, from, other, albums, of, R&B, 'cover', tunes, is, the, range, of, her, choices,, starting, with, the, 1963, Baby, Washington, chestnut, "That's, How, Heartaches, Are, Made", through, to, Donny, Hathaway's, eternal, "Someday, We'll, All, Be, Free", and, on, to, Luther, Vandross', first, solo, 1981, smash,, "Never, Too, Much.", For, good, measure,, Deniece, re-recorded, her, own, "Cause, You, Love, Me, Baby,", a, staple, in, her, repertoire, since, the, track, was, included, in, her, 1976, Columbia, debut, album, as, well, as, cutting, a, brand, new, song,, "The, Only, Thing, I'm, Missing, Is, You,", a, prime, romantic, mood-setting,, sensuous, cut, which, showcases, the, songbird, sounding, better, than, ever!, The, basic, tracks, on, Love,, Niecey, Style, were, cut, by, producer, Eli, in, Philadelphia;, an, all-star, cast, of, West, Coast, musicians, including, saxman, Everette, Harp,, bass, player, extraordinaire, Freddie, Washington, and, Tower, Of, Power, trumpeter, Greg, Adams, then, added, their, musical, skills, to, the, album., Says, Deniece,, "It, was, an, extraordinary, experience, to, make, music, with, such, gifted, musicians…words, could, never, truly, express, how, special, it, made, me, feel, being, in, the, studio, again, with, Stevie,, George,, Philip,, Greg,, Freddie, and, Everette., Truly,, I, was, surrounded, by, friends, and, loved, ones.", The, spirit, of, love, and, celebration, is, displayed, throughout, Love,, Niecey, Style., Speaking, about, her, choices, for, the, album,, Deniece, explains,, "I'd, been, wanting, to, record, "That's, How, Heartaches, Are, Made", for, years., I, was, thirteen, when, I, first, heard, Baby, Washington, sing, this, song., It, touched, my, heart, because, at, the, time,, I, was, in, love, with, this, boy, but, he, didn't, love, me, the, same, way!, When, we, started, recording, the, song,, I, could, hear, Stevie, (Wonder), playing, harmonica, on, it., 'Can, you, come, down?', I, asked, and, he, was, gracious, enough, to, play, on, the, track., It, turned, out, beautifully., Then,, "Love's, Holiday", has, always, been, one, of, my, favorite, EW&F, songs., It, was, also, written, by, Skip, Scarborough,, who, I, feel, was, one, of, the, best, songwriters, of, our, generation., Then, having, my, dearest, friend, Philip, Bailey, sing, on, it…it, doesn't, get, any, better, than, that!", The, standout, ballad, "This, Time, I'll, Be, Sweeter", (previously, cut, by, both, Angela, Bofill, and, Roberta, Flack,, one, of, the, many, artists, whose, recordings, -, including, Minnie, Riperton, and, Esther, Phillips, -, benefited, from, Deniece's, work, as, a, session, singer, in, the, '70s), is, a, tribute, to, a, longtime, friend:, "The, song, was, written, by, the, late, Gwen, Guthrie, who, we, lost, to, breast, cancer., Gwen, used, to, sing, with, me,, Lani, Groves, and, Patti, Austin, -, we, were, in, the, same, circle, of, background, singers, when, I, lived, in, New, York, and, I, remember, when, she, wrote, the, song., I, always, wanted, to, do, it, and, it's, my, way, of, honoring, Gwen.", Deniece, says, the, two, most, challenging, tunes, were, her, reading, of, Donny, Hathaway's, "Someday, We'll, All, Be, Free", (which, features, Greg, Adams), and, one, of, the, only, covers, ever, done, of, Luther's, "Never, Too, Much.", The, vocalist, shares,, "I, told, Bobby, (Eli), and, Executive, Producer, Danny, Weiss, that, I, wanted, to, do, Donny's, song., After, I, listened, to, his, rendition, again,, I, just, broke, down, and, cried., I, thought,, 'do, I, have, the, audacity, to, do, this, song?', I, called, the, record, company, and, told, them, I'd, made, a, mistake., They, said,, 'are, you, crazy?, No…you, gotta, do, the, song!', It, has, a, beautiful, message, of, encouragement, so, I'm, glad, I, did, it., As, for, the, Luther, song,, well,, he, was, a, friend, and, certainly, one, of, the, best, vocalists, of, our, time., I, had, no, idea, how, hard, a, song, "Never, Too, Much", was, to, sing, –, you, can, hardly, sing, and, breathe, on, it., I, tell, people,, when, I, get, to, heaven,, I'm, going, to, tell, Luther, how, hard, it, was, to, do!", Keeping, with, contemporary, classics, of, the, '80s,, Deniece, chose, Kool, &, The, Gang's, "Cherish", about, which, she, says,, "real, love, only, happens, on, a, few, occasions, and, when, we, have, it,, we, shouldn't, take, it, for, granted";, and, George, Benson's, 1983, hit,, "Love, Me, (One, More, Time)", which, she, declares, is, her, favorite, Benson, song,, given, "something, really, special, by, George, (Duke), who, played, on, the, track.", Rounding, out, this, stellar, collection, are, her, own, "Cause, You, Love, Me, Baby", and, "If, You, Really, Love, Me,", another, nod, to, Stevie, Wonder., "I, sang, this, song, so, much, as, background, for, Stevie, that, at, one, time,, I, was, singing, it, in, my, sleep!, I, was, very, apprehensive, about, doing, this, song, because, he, was, and, still, is, my, mentor, and, I, wanted, to, please, him., I, think, I've, made, him, proud.", The, choice, for, Deniece, Williams, to, revisit, one, of, her, own, classic, tunes, "Cause, You, Love, Me, Baby", was, easy:, "I've, been, very, blessed, as, a, songwriter, and, publisher, to, have, so, much, of, my, music, sampled., I, was, going, to, re-do, "Free", but, then, I, thought, it, would, be, good, to, do, something, up-tempo, because, it's, been, sampled, by, so, many, other, artists…and, being, the, romantic, I, am,, it, seemed, perfect, for, this, project.", Since, the, mid-'80s,, Deniece, has, been, busier, than, ever,, recording, a, children's, CD,, Lullabies, To, Dreamland,, appearing, in, the, London, cast, of, the, pioneering, musical, "Mama, I, Want, To, Sing,", producing, and, hosting, her, own, radio, program,, "The, Deniece, Williams, Show", for, BBC, Radio, for, almost, ten, years., Purposely, devoting, much, of, her, time, to, raising, her, four, sons,, Deniece, says, she, made, a, conscious, choice, to, limit, her, touring, activities:, "I've, been, doing, maybe, ten, concerts, a, year, and, in, recent, years,, I've, really, got, into, writing, theater, pieces, and, developing, film, scripts, with, my, older, sons., I, felt, it, was, time, to, test, myself, in, other, creative, ways., Now, with, my, children, grown,, it's, time, for, mom, to, be, out, there, again!, I, chose, to, stay, at, home, and, did, only, 10%, of, what, I, could, have, done., Vocally,, I, think, I'm, stronger, than, I've, ever, been, and, it's, time, to, get, out, there, and, do, it., I've, been, blessed, with, a, fantastic, audience, and, I'm, always, humbled, by, that., My, audience, reminds, me, that, this, is, what, I'm, supposed, to, be, doing!",  , News, 2007, News, 2006, News, 2005, News, 2004, News, 2003, News, 2002, News, 2001]
