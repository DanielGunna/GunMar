March, 25,, 2017, Noel, Gallagher, is, worse, than, his, brother, at, fashion, To, be, honest,, we'd, assumed, that, Pretty, Green, set, the, bar, so, high, for, 'terrible, Oasis, related, fashion, activity', that, it, was, a, record, which, would, never, be, beaten., Like, Seb, Coe's, 800, metres, in, 1981,, it, looked, like, we'd, found, a, marker, in, human, endeavour, that, would, endure., But, like, Seb, Coe's, record,, nothing, lasts, forever., There's, something, worse, just, round, the, corner:, Noel, Gallagher, has, partnered, with, Adidas, for, a, new, signature, shoe., The,

'world-beatingly, godawful':, The, shoe, comes, in, indigo, leather, and, is, said, to, be, 70s-inspired,, featuring, a, picture, of, Noel, on, the, shoe’s, tongue, and, his, date, of, birth, inside.Ninety, Nine, Pounds., For, a, shoe, that, only, really, functions, as, a, way, that, Liam, can, remember, when, he's, meant, to, send, Noel, a, birthday, card., Some, of, the, Adidas, celeb, tie-ups, now, are, so, bad,, I, suspect, they're, just, an, elaborate, trolling, activity, on, the, part, of, a, company, which, has, frankly, grown, bored, of, fiddling, with, the, sleeve, length,

presenter, since, Kylie, in, 2009.), It, wasn't, meant, to, be, Dermot, though,, with, or, without, Emma., The, original, plan, had, been, for, Michael, Buble, to, host., Buble, cancelled, because, his, son, is, seriously, ill,, which, cramps, the, opportunity, to, be, snarky, about, it., Buble, could, have, worked, as, a, host, -, like, James, Blunt, and, Josh, Groban,, regardless, of, what, you, think, about, their, ability, to, clear, a, room, with, their, music, -, they're, entertaining, when, being, themselves., But, two, and, a, half, hours, of, warm, self-deprecation, might, have,

going, to, be, in, store, for, his, performance., "I've, got, a, few, things, up, my, sleeve", he, says,, not, especially, mysteriously., 6.38, Ed's, looking, forward, to, seeing, Skepta., This, is, as, dull, an, interview, as, you'd, expect., On, another, part, of, the, carpet,, James, Arthur, is, also, being, dull., He'd, never, have, thought, it, would, have, been, possible., And, something, or, other, is, "one, million, per, cent"., 6.41, It's, Little, Mix., They, can't, believe, how, many, nominations, they've, got., It's, mental,, apparently., The, Mix, are, promising, "a, completely, different, thing, we've, never, done, before"., Singing, in, tune,, maybe., Are, the, dance, routines, going, to, be, "quite, saucy"?, They, won't, say., This, is, illuminating, stuff., It's, odd, that, the, Brits, have, stuck, with, ITV,, isn't, it?, ITV, isn't, really, the, home, of, Top, Quality, Awards, any, more, -, they've, never, had, the, Oscars;, gave, up, on, the, BAFTAs, and, even, the, British, Comedy, Awards, has, gone, elsehwere., The, Brits, now, sits, alongside, that, one, where, Carol, Vorderman, gives, prizes, to, sick, kiddies, and, what, feels, like, a, dozen, events, sponsored, by, third-tier, TV, listings, mags, which, exist, to, give, an, excuse, for, Kym, Marsh, to, squeeze, into, a, couture, boob, tube,, and, for, Helen, Flanagan, to, fall, out, of, similar., 6.45, Crisps,, says, an, ad,, are, a, big, deal, at, Asda., That's, the, biggest, newsline, so, far, this, evening., They're, talking, about, the, Zaha, Hadid, Brits, statues, now,, because, you, know, how, an, ITV2, audience, loves, architectural, talk., 6.50, Ellie, Goulding's, turned, up, and, actually, is, trying, to, talk, about, music., Along, the, corridor,, Craig, David, is, showing, off, his, trainers., It's, been, sixteen, years, since, he, was, last, nominated, and, he, hasn't, really, come, up, with, anything, to, say, in, the, meantime., "It's, a, prestigious, award, -, as,

amongst, the, category, of, powerful, ladies.", The, Category, Of, Powerful, Ladies, is, a, Alan, Moore, book, waiting, to, be, written., Rita, Ora, trots, up,, four, times, nominated, and, never, a,

refusing, to, reveal, the, secret, for, her, performance, this, evening., It's, a, parade, of, wait, and, see., A, note, on, diversity:, this, year's, shortlist, seems, a, little, more, adventurous, than, in, previous, years,, but, still, less, diverse, than,, for, example,, the, Top, 40, is., You, can, see, they've, tried,, though., Sadly,, it's, like, when, Donald, Trump, finally, manages, to, denounce, anti-Semitism, -, knowing, how, hard, the, world, had, to, push, to, get, them, there, rather, undermines, the, power, of, the, message., 7.11, Stormzy, actually, looks, really, good, in, his, suit., If, you're, going, to, do, a, suit,, people,, do, a, suit., Don't, do, it, apologetically, or, ironically., That's, the, rule., He's, been, challenged, to, get, a, selfie, with, Little,

7.22, I'm, frying, eggs, while, Whiley, is, being, very, excited, about, being, on, TV, -, he's, the, first, person, who, seems, genuniely, thrilled, to, be, here., 7.27, Katy, Perry, is, a, consumate, professional, -, she, says, as, little, as, most, of, the, other, guests,, but, is, able, to, disguise, it., She's, into, a, rambling, story, about, snot, and, Natalie, Imbruglia., 7.30, Somehow, the, Red, Carpet, programme, has, managed, to, over, run., Lets, shoot, over, to, ITV..., Robbie's, star, has, sunk, so, low, he's, reduced, to, doing, the, Mastercard, break, bumpers, this, year., 7.33, Dermot, O'Leary, (and, Emma, Willis), is, stood, on, top, of, the, O2, to, start, the, programme., With, Williams,, Mars, and, Sande, in, the, line-up,, you, might, choose, to, stay, there,, mate., Little, Mix, are, being, carried, onto, the, stage, by, what, looks, like, those, people, who, paint, themselves, silver, and, stand, around, at, Covent, Garden., The, band, themselves, are, wearing, what, would, happen, if, Kwik, Fit, tried, to, make, Beyonce's, outfits, out, of, used, tyres., This, is, Shout, Out, My, Ex,, which, is, one, of, the, last, year's, best, pop, songs,, to, be, fair., And, it's, not, The, Saturdays., Dermot's, doing, that, thing, where, he, sucks, his, finger, and, looks, puzzled., And, Emma's, reading, an, autocue., All, everyone's, love, is, being, sent, to, Michael, Buble, -, there, was, some, genuine, applause, but, in, the, cavernous, O2, it, sounded, a, little, underwhelming., Dermot's, doing, that, thing, where, he, shoves, his, fist, into,

tonight", says, Michael, C, Hall,, picking, up, the, prize., 8.08, "Lovely, stuff", says, Dermot,, uncertain, how, to, segue, into, Emeli, Sande, playing, live., They, keep, insisting, that, Emeli, Sande, has, been, away, for, four, years,, but, she, seems, to, have, been, everywhere, all, the, time,, and, this, song, seems, to, be, the, same, one, she, was, doing, during, the, Olympics,, so, how, does, that, work?, 8.11, Sande, has, dressed, her, dancers, in, the, frumpiest, outfits, I, have, ever, seen, anyone, dance, in,, and, that, includes, that, time, one, of, Queen, dressed, up, as, Ena, Sharples., 8.12, The, clock, says, it, was, four, minutes,, but, that, felt, a, lot, more, like, half, of, my, remaining, life, dripping, away, during, it., "She, is, a, firecracker", says, Emma,

himself,, Nick, Grimshaw., Noms:, Anne-Marie, Blossoms, Rag'n'Bone, Man, Skepta, Stormzy, It, should, either, be, Skepta, or, Stormzy,, but, the, dunderheads, at, the, Brits, are, going, to, give, it, to, Raggedy, Boneman,, aren't, they?, Yes., Inevitably, they, do., 8.20, Apparently, Ragged, Bowman, spent, ten, weeks, at, number, one, in, Germany,, which, probably, isn't, going, to, help, us, with, the, Brexit, negotiations., He's, unable, to, busk, a, thank, you, speech., Back, on, the, floor,, Dermot, is, sitting, at, Ed, Sheeran's, table, for, a, little, chitty-chat., And, now, The, 1975, are, taking, to, the, stage, to, literally, earn, the, award, they've, been, given., They've, brought, a, large, gospel, choir, with, them, to..., well,, really,, just, to, make, the, sides, of, stage, seem, a, lot, less, empty, as, they're, not, really, high, enough, in, the, mix, to, do, anything, much, else., They, could, have, done, pot, plants, and, lamps, for, a, third, of, the, budget., They're, flashing, up, some, critical, messages, on, a, disgusting, salmon, pink, background, -, I, suspect, it's, intended, as, a, 'ha!, fuck, you', to, anyone, who's, criticised, them, in, the, past,, but, it, actually, comes, across, a, little, needy., "Trying, too, hard", reads, one, of, the, cards, -, and,, yeah,, that's, actually, valid, criticism, here., A, couple, might, have, been, wry,, but, spending, so, much, time, throwing, them, on, the, screen, felt, a, little..., well..., like, this:, "And, now, we, move, onto, the, liars...", 8.26, "It's, time, for, a, break.", Of, course, it, is., 8.27, The, Brits,, traditionally,, doesn't, have, a, 'those, we, have, lost', section, -, presumably, because, back, in, the, early, days,, pop, star, death, was, still, quite, rare, and, it, was, still, a, (relatively), young, person's, game,, so, there, simply, weren't, enough, stiffs, to, populate, a, three, minute, montage, over, Annie, Lennox, doing, 'Where, Have, All, The, Flowers, Gone'., The, movie, industry, -, and, the, more, classic-inclusive, Grammys, -, have, always, had, enough, losses, to, justify, a, special, departure, gate., This, year,, with, Bowie, and, Leonard, Cohen, amongst, the, nominees,, should, be, the, one, that, makes, the, organisers, realise, it's, time, for, a, pause, to, remember, those, who, died, during, the, year., At, the, moment,, we, get, the, odd, splash, for, very, big, names,, but, many, significant, figures, are, allowed, to, slip, away, without, even, a, mention., It's, right, to, give, thanks, for, George, Michael,, but, there, should, be, room, for, Rick, Parfitt,, too., 8.31, If, you, must, celebrate, a, rag, &, bone, man..., try, this:, 8.32, And, they, have, done, a, full, memorial, section., Although, the, names, are, crowded, on, the, screen, so, it's, more, like, a, video, game, than, a, moment, of, reflection., 8.34, Ridgeley,, Pepsi, and, Shirley, have, come, on, stage, to, pay, tribute, to, George., Andrew, looks, more, like, Philip, Green, these, days,, it, turns, out., It's, nice, to, see, all, three, of, them, on, stage, together, again., It's, easy, to, forget, there, was, a, time, that, Wham, were, presented, as, a, four-piece...., 8.37, Shirley, talking, about, how, a, label, gave, the, young, band, a, chance,, although, the, way, Michael, was, screwed, over, by, the, labels, probably, not, the, best, of, memories., Shirley's, breaking, down, a, bit., This, is, quite, a, long, talky, bit., They're, bringing, on, Chris, Martin, to, do, A, Different, Corner,, which, is, a, bit, like, a, tribute, to, Red, Rum, ending, with, the, pantomime, horse, from, Rentaghost, running, about, the, stage., Martin, is, murdering, this., 8.42, Chris, Martin, is, pouring, All, The, Emotions(TM), into, this,, like, a, man, who, bought, a, big, tub, of, Emotions, at, Costco, and, is, prepared, to, use, it, in, one, go., 8.44, "If, I, could,, I, would,, I, swear", says, Chris,

that, undermines, a, woman’s, self, belief.”, Marie, also, pointed, out, that, ‘I’m, with, the, band’, is, the, title, of, a, famous, 2005, novel, by, Pamela, Des, Barres, -, a, former, rock, ‘n’,

about, me, so, I, don’t, accept, that.”Yep,, there, has, been, a, weak, attempt, at, 'perhaps, the, phrase, means, the, person, is, part, of, the, structure, of, support, underpinning, the, band,

She’s, a, very, intelligent, woman, but, I, don’t, see, much, to, fear., I, will, say, it, is, great, to, have, a, woman, in, charge, of, the, country., She’s, very, sensible, and, I, think, that’s, a, good, thing, at, this, point, in, time.Now,, Kate, Bush, talking, warmly, about, a, Tory, prime, minister, might, be, disappointing,, but, surely, at, a, time, when, we've, got, actual, fascists, about, to, take, office, space, in, the, White, House,, the, small, mercy, that, she, wasn't, bellowing, "Brexit, now", and, bigging, up, the, Farage, must, count, for, something., More, importantly,, if, you're, going, to, quote, the, reply,, you, should, probably, look, at, the, question,, too:, A, track, called, “Waking, the, Witch”—which, was, released, in, 1985—was, performed, for, Before, The, Dawn., You, once, said, that, the, song, was, about, “the, fear, of, women’s, power.”, With, regards, to, Hillary, Clinton’s, recent, defeat,, do, you, think, that, this, fear, is, stronger, than, ever?So, when, Kate, was, talking, about, not, having, any, reason, to, fear,, she, wasn't, saying, from, May's, policies,, but, fear, of, the, idea, of, a, woman, leading, a, nation., Her,

of, Boris, Johnson,, to, the, chums, of, Liam, Fox., And,, let's, face, it,, she's, comfortably, off, and, clearly, had, a, lot, of, piano, lessons, as, a, small, child,, neither, of, which, are,

really, knows,, do, they?, They, told, Stephen, Hawking, he, only, had, a, year, left, to, live, and, how, many, years, ago, was, that?, You, can’t, know, it, all., If, ever, there’s, been, somebody, to, hold, as, an, icon, of, sheer, determination, and, willpower,, it’s, that, guy,, let, alone, any, of, the, things, he’s, done, scientifically., I’m, sure, that’s, his, driving, force,, but, he’s, a, miracle, and, an, aspiration.For, "someone, who, has, written, about, environmental, issues",, giving, an, answer, which, ignores, the, environment, and, instead, focuses, on, how, Stephen, Hawking, didn't, accept, a, diagnosis, is, heartbreaking., It, seems, to, be, implying, that, all, we, need, to, do, abotu, climate, change, is, pop, over, to, the, burning, fires, of, Siberia,,

Livingstone., The, lyrics, included:, "Look, to, the, left, and, to, the, right., We, need, help, and, there's, nobody, in, sight., Where, is, the, man, that, we, all, need?, Well, tell, him, he's, to, come, and, rescue, me., Ken, is, the, man, that, we, all, need., Ken, is, the, leader, of, the, GLC.", The, track, also, describes, Livingstone, as, "a, sex, machine".This, isn't, wrong,, but, it,

is, that, Cooper, wants, Radio, 1, to, become, "the, Netflix, of, music, radio":, “I, want, Radio, 1, to, be, the, Netflix, of, music, radio,”, he, says,, trundling, out, the, catchy, soundbite, to,

available, on, demand,, aren't, they?, Turns, out, these, are, different, programmes:, He, is, starting, out, with, 25, hours, of, on-demand, “phone-first”, content,, such, as, a, weekly, “Top, 10,

They, want, content, on, whatever, device, they, are, using,, increasingly, the, phone,, when, they, want, it,, and, that, is, the, key, for, us, to, stay, relevant, and, stay, young.”There's, a, few, problems, with, this, -, if, people, aren't, listening, to, Radio, 1,, why, would, they, give, a, raspberry, tuppence, about, listening, to, a, programme, which, plays, the, 'most, played', tracks?, "Hey, kids,, those, programmes, you're, ignoring?, Want, to, listen, to, the, sort, of, music, they're, playing, that, isn't, encouraging, you, to, listen, to, them?", More, importantly,, if, you,
