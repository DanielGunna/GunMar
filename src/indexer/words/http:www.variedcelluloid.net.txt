Blues:, No, Future, No, Holds, Barred, Special, ID, Scorpion, Thunderbolt, Weird, Cinema, Episode, 2, Posted, by, Josh, Samford, On, January, -, 27, -, 2017ADD, COMMENTS, This, sudden, update, to, the, website, must, come, as, a, shock, to, those, of, you, who, have, kept, up, with, Varied, Celluloid, over, the, years., Indeed,, it, has, been, two, years, since, the, website, has, been, updated., Quite, the, period, of, inactivity., For, those, who, know, me, personally,, you, know, that, during, that, time, I, finished, with, my, first, degree,, began, a, new, career,, got, engaged,, and, have, had, life, change, drastically., However,, I’ve, continued, to, pay, the, bill, for, Varied, Celluloid,, and, never, once, thought, about, deactivating, it, despite, not, knowing, when, I, would, be, free, to, write, for, it, again., Varied, Celluloid, is, a, project, that, I, began, in, my, teenage, years., The, habit, of, writing,, due, to, this, website,, has, helped, me, so, much, in, my, personal, life., However,, it, seems, that, film, blogs, and, writing…, well,, it’s, becoming, more, and, more, a, lost, art., While, I, do, not, intend, to, ever, give, it, up,, I, would, like, to, discuss, film, in, as, many, different, avenues, as, I, can., Weird, Cinema, is, something, I, dream, about, doing, more, and, more, often., However,, the, amount, of, time, that, I, commit, to, each, project, is, insane., When, it, comes, to, writing,, I, like, to, get, out, a, quick, and, easy, opinion, on, a, single, film., While, I, do, try, and, include, a, bit, of, investigative, journalism, when, writing, about, films,, for, instance, many, of, my, last, old-school, kung, fu, film, reviews, have, seen, me, discussing, the, actual, history, surrounding, the, onscreen, situations,, when, it, comes, to, releasing, a, video, via, YouTube, –, I, feel, there’s, much, more, that, needs, to, go, into, such, projects., I, like, to, include, a, bit, of, humor, when, possible,, but, I, realize, that, my, voice, is, a, bit, monotone,, so, what, can, be, done, to, spruce, things, up?, The, content., For, these, videos,, I, like, to, ensure, that, the, content, is, concise,, clear,, and, features, information, that, has, to, be, gathered, via, hours, of, dedicated, reading, and, research., I, would, also, like, for, each, project, to, have, some, “pizazz”, to, it., I, want, the, project, to, look, as, close, to, a, moderately, funded, documentary, as, I, can, possibly, make, it,, without,, of, course,, any, kind, of, funding, and, without, any, sort, of, crew, or, help., Everything, you, see, in, these, videos, has, been, done, by, me,, and, I’m, sure, that, is, obvious, due, to, its, quality., In, this, particular, episode,, unfortunately, I, did, not, have, a, windscreen, over, my, new, microphone, and, I, had, no, idea, how, much, that, would, factor, into, the, sound, quality., I, intend, to, rectify, this, with, the, next, episode,, whatever, that, may, be., For, what, purpose, is, all, of, this?, Is, it, in, the, hopes, to, make, money?, No., It, is, in, the, hopes, of, becoming, internet, famous?, No., I, simply, want, to, share, these, movies, with, other, people., I, would, love, it, if, these, videos, were, shared, with, others, and, managed, to, reach, new, audiences, with, film, fans, around, the, world., However,, if, that, is, not, in, the, cards,, then, at, least, my, passion, and, creativity, can, be, seen, by, the, very, few, who, stumble, upon, these., So,, with, all, of, that, out, of, the, way,, I, hope, some, manage, to, enjoy, this, second, episode., It, covers, Frederic, Hobbs,, director, of, Godmonster, of, Indian, Flats,, a, movie, that, in, the, past, I, have, referred, to, as, “one, of, the, worst, movies, of, all, time.”, A, title, that,, these, days,, I, do, not, feel, it, deserves,, but, a, title, that, I, can’t, blame, people, for, bestowing, upon, it., It, is, a, very, strange, piece, of, film, from, a, very, strange, filmmaker,, and, hopefully, this, video, can, help, answer, some, questions, about, it., If, you’d, like,, you, can, also, check, out, my, review, for, it, that, I, wrote, nearly, ten, years, ago,, but, I, must, say,, it’s, not, nearly, as, informative, as, the, video!, News, Seven, Warriors, Posted, by, Josh, Samford, On, January, -, 27, -, 2017ADD,

regularly,, you, may, have, noticed, the, slowdown, in, posts, during, the, Summer., While, the, initial, goal, was, to, take, the, Summer, to, write, many, more, reviews,, due, to, my, being, out, from, school, and, having, a, bit, of, free, time,, but, instead, I, ended, up, working, on, a, different, side, project., That, side, project, is, Weird, Cinema., This, is, a, new, webshow, based, around, niche, films, and, film, markets., The, idea, is, to, take, a, lot, of, time, for, each, episode, in, order, to, make, it, as, thorough, an, well-crafted, as, is, possible, for, a, one-man, team., That, doesn’t, mean, Varied, Celluloid, is, completely, on, the, side,, it, just, means, that, thins, are, progressing, and, things, are, expanding., There, are, more, reviews, written, right, now, and, are, sure, to, be, posted, soon., However,, for, the, time, being,, take, a, quick, look, at, this, first, project, in, order, to, get, a, feel, for, what, Weird, Cinema, is, going, to, bring, to, the, table., This, episode, covers, IFD, Films, and, Arts, along, with, Godfrey, Ho, and, all, of, the, “big”, cast, members, who, helped, bring, to, life, many, of, the, crazy, ninja, movies, that, have, been, reviewed, here, on, the, site, within, recent, months., Hope, you, enjoy, it, and, I, hope, many, can, learn, something, about, these, crazy, movies., News, Female, Teacher:,
