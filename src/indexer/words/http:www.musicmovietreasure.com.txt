"WE'RE, GONNA, NEED, A, BIGGER, BOAT", to, describe, the, moment, he, saw, jaws, and, realised, that, they, were, in, a, small, fishing, boat., Because, Jaws, was, the, first, movie, to, gross, $1, million,, everyone, really, enjoyed, this, line., Little, did, they, know, that, this, too, wasn't, written, in, the, script, and, was, simply, an, off-the-cuff, remark, by, Scheider., Order, your,

trying, to, time, it, so, that, they, would, hit, the, light, without, having, to, pause, while, walking., During, one, take,, they, had, it, timed, perfectly, but, a, cab, came, out, of, nowhere,

film, is, undeniable., This, comes, into, play, sensationally, in, the, scene, where, Gere, gives, Roberts, a, necklace, to, wear, with, her, extraordinary, new, evening, dress., When, he, opens, the, box,, she, reaches, up, to, touch, it, and, Gere, playfully, snaps, it, down, on, her, fingers., She, erupts, into, laughter, and, it, seems, like, a, well, written, scene, to, the, audience., What, you, may, or, may, not, know, is, that, this, moment, was, not, in, the, script, at, all., Gere, was, just, playing, with, Roberts, and, she, got, a, good, chuckle, out, of, it., It, was, so,

Azkaban,, release, date, Don't, Look, Now, (1973), Movie, Review, Don’t, Look, Now, is, a, 1973, psychological, or, psychic, thriller,, a, horror, movie, that, is, full, of, suspense, rather, than, a, lot, of, gore., This, film, stars, Donald, Sutherland, and, Julie, Christie. The, Guardian considers, this, to, be, amongst, the, top, five, performances, given, by, Sutherland, and, Christie,, like, Sutherland,, has, a, long, list, of, credits, to, her, name, that, include, Doctor, Zhivago,, Finding, Neverland, and, Harry, Potter, and, the, Prisoner, of, Azkaban., Don’t, Look, Now, is, set, in, Venice,, Italy, an, “elegantly, decaying, city,", words, that certainly, depict, the, Venice, you, see, in, this, movie., Shot, in, the, wintertime,, Venice, is, abandoned,, gray, and, miserable., Watching, this, film, gives, you, a, good, idea, of, what, the, layout, of, Venice, is, like, in, terms, of, canals,, walkways, and, bridges, but, it, will, do, little, to, make, you, want, to, visit, the, city., Venice, is, the, third, star, in, this, movie,, lending, exactly, the, right, atmosphere, with, plenty, of, dead, ends, and, wrong, turns, to, create, the, perfect, atmosphere, and, set., Roger, Ebert , said, that, could, not, picture, this, film, set, anywhere, else, and, I, agree, and The, Guardian, calls, the, Venice, of, this, movie, mysterious, and, exotic, and, untouristy., Once, again,, I, agree., Don't, Look, Now, tells, the, story, of, a, couple, struggling, to, get, past, the, death, of, a, child, who, relocate, to, Venice, and, chance, to, meet, two, weird, sisters,, one, of, whom, is, psychic., These, women, appear, throughout, the, movie, in, a, haunting, fashion, but, beware, for, as, the, movie, tagline, says,, “Things, are, not, what, they, seem.”, Here’s, the, original, movie, trailer,, which, has, no, spoilers, in, it., What, is, there, to, object, to?, This, movie, is, rated, R, for, Restricted, so, there, is, a, lot, to, be, aware, of., There, is, an, accidental, death,, an, extended, sex, scene, and, a, nasty, murder, with, blood, but, the, movie, is, really, more, suspenseful, than, gory., There, is, drinking, and, smoking., As, I, expected, when, we, were, watching, the, movie,, the, sex, scene, was, very, controversial, in, its, time., It, might, be, important, to, note, that,, although, lengthy,, the, scene, is, meant, to, be, the, beautiful, coming, together, of, two, married, adults, who, had, drifted, apart. The, Guardian  considers, the, sex, scene, to, be, one, of, the, ten, best, because, of, the, “emotional, freight”, that, comes, with, it., Recommended?, The, case, for, this, movie, says, that, Don’t, Look, Now, is, as, renowned, “for, its, innovative, editing, and, haunting, cinematography, as, it, is, for, its, naturalistic, eroticism, and, unforgettable, climax, and, denouement”, and, that, it, is, considered, one, of, the, great, endings, in, horror, movie, history., In, 2002, Roger, Ebert said, this, movie, “remains, one, of, the, great, horror, masterpieces”, elaborating, by, saying,, that, it, “works, not, with, fright,, which, is, easy,, but, with, dread,, grief, and, apprehension.”, Exactly., I, chose, this, movie, because, it, was, set, in, Venice, and, it, definitely, turned, out, to, be, an, interesting, choice, though, not, perhaps, in, the, way, I, thought, it, might., With, the, warnings, mentioned, in, the, preceding, paragraph,, I, would, recommend, this, movie, for, those, who, want, something, different, and, who, are, interested, in, the, history, of, cinema., It, does, give, a, peek, into, the, workings, of, Venice, but, is, definitely, not, a, great, travelogue, for, the, city., Blu-ray.com , praises, Criterion, for, the, quality, of, the, digital, restoration, so, if, you, buy, this, movie,, you, probably, should, buy, the, Criterion, Collection, version,, which, will, also, allow, you, to, watch, the, special, features, and, learn, more, about, how, this, movie, was, made, and, why, it, is, important, to, the, history, of, cinematography., Here’s, the, trailer, for, the, Criterion, reissue, in, which, you, will, definitely, be, able, to, see, the, improvement, of, quality, from, that, of, the, original, trailer,, which, was, shown, above., Don’t, Look, Now, is, based, on, a, short, story, by, Daphne, du, Maurier., If, you, are, a, reader,, it, might, be, a, movie, to, check, out, in, print, form, prior, to, or, even, after, watching, the, movie., Because, it, was, a, short, story,, the, movie, provides, more, story, than, the, author's, version., You, can, learn, more, about, or, buy, your, copy, of, the, Criterion, Collection's, version, on, Amazon by, clicking, right, here., By, the, way, The, Guardian and, other, sources, online, say, that,  Don’t, Look, Now, is, being, remade., Given, the, nature, of, the, story, and, it’s, position, as, one, of, Britain’s, finest, horror, stories,, there, is, considerable, scepticism, about, whether, this, is, the, appropriate, type, of, movie, for, a, remake., If, you, watch, the, film, or, have, seen, it,, I, am, sure, you, will, understand, why, it, might, be, hard, to, successfully, remake, this, movie., Will, you, be, watching, or, reading, Don't, Look, Now?, If, you, have, seen, it,, what, did, you, think?, Finally,, what, do, you, think, of, the, idea, of, a, remake, this,

Day,, Raoul, Bova, (The, Tourist,, Under, the, Tuscan, Sun), and, Claudia, Cardinale, (an, Italian, actress.), It, is, a, romantic, comedy, that, starts, off, in, the, beautiful, Italian, countryside, and, arrives,, after, an, adventuresome, journey,, in, Rome, hence, the, title, All, Roads, Lead, to, Rome., The, movie, was, a, light, and, entertaining, film,, definitely, not, the, best, romantic, com, ever, but, an, enjoyable, film, with, not, much, to, object, to., No, sex, although, there, is, reference, to, a, teen’s, unhealthy, relationship,, some, social, drinking,, marijuana, use, once, and, infrequent, swearing., The, movie, is, rated, PG, 13, and, that, seems, like, a, good, guideline, to, me., While, we, did, finally, arrive, in, Rome, (in, the, movie),, it, showed, some, highlights, of, the, city., However,, this, would, not, be, my, top, pick, as, an, Italian-themed, movie, to, enhance, your, enjoyment, of, an, upcoming, or, a, reminder, of, a, past, trip, to, Italy, and, Rome., There, were, a, few,, “I’ve, been, there!”, moments, but, overall, I, felt, that, the, movie, did, not, really, do, a, fabulous, job, of, displaying, Rome., Would, I, recommend, it?, Yes,, as, I, said, for, a, light, movie., However,, I’d, pick, Letters, to, Juliet, or, Under, the, Tuscan, Sun, first., You, can, read, more, about All, Roads, Lead, to, Rome, on, Amazon, by, clicking,
