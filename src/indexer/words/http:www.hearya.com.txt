My, Mind, wound, up, in, my, inbox, and, I, decided, to, dig, in, anticipation, of, taking, in, a, set., It, wasn’t, long, before, Combs, moved, from, the, “Maybe, I’ll, catch, a, set, list,”, to, the, “Must-see, list”, Combs,, a, 30, y/o, Nashville, resident, has, really, come, into, his, own, on, his, third, LP., On, Canyons, Of, My, Mind,, Combs, has, put, an, album, together, that, showcases, a, varied, number, of, textures, and, subjects., A, distressed, Combs, shows, off, his, chops, on, Dirty, Rain,, a, song, in, protest, to, the, gentrification, of, Nashville, and, how, we, constantly, shit, on, our, environment, in, the, name, of, “progress.”, He, steps, into, the, political, fray, with, Bourgeois, King,, probably, the, most, rocking, tune, on, the, album, and, a, tune, he, just, slayed, at, SXSW., “We’ll, build, a, wall, to, block, the, enemy/, build, a, wall, to, keep, us, free”, is, sung, repeatedly, about, midway, through, the, tune, before, the, band, launches, into, a, tasty, jam., Combs, is, easing, into, the, next, phase, of, his, life., He’s, married,, has, a, house, and, a, baby, on, the, way., His, comfort, and, growth, is, on, display, throughout.,

aspects, of, Kevin, Morby, and, it, also, kicks, off, a, bit, of, a, Matthew, E., White, vibe, as, well., I’m, really, digging, these, tracks, and, this, album, is, a, nice, push, forward, from, 2016′s, Mowing., Follow, me, on, Twitter, at, @WoodyHearYa, or, @HearYa, Michael, Nau, is, here, Tweet, {, 0, comments, }, Gold, Star, –, Big, Blue, (album, review), by, Woody, on, April, 10,, 2017, Gold, Star,, the, moniker, for, singer-songwriter, Marlon, Rabenreither,, was, someone, we, just, stumbled, across, during, out, latest, SXSW, adventure., For, someone, who, meticulously, plans, his, SXSW;, it’s, still, nice, to, wander, into, a, venue, having, with, no, expectations, and, be, blown, away., Gold, Star, took, the, stage, on, the, Thursday, night, backed, by, his, excellent, band, and, the, troubador, produced, a, wonderful, set, of, easy-going, twang., At, the, conclusion, of, his, set,, I, was, happy, to, learn, that, Big, Blue, was, being, released, right, after, SXSW., And, I’m, even, happier, to, state,, that, it, lives, up, the, billing, of, his, set., Rabenreither’s, music, comes, across, as, genuine, and, soulful,, without, ever, coming, across, as, overdone, or, over-produced., The, tune, below,, Sonny’s, Blues,, really, reminds, me, of, the, early, Wilco, days., Rabenreither’s, lyrics, remind, me, Tweedy’s, observational, side., And, musically,, it, could, slip, onto, Being, There, without, a, second, thought., I, felt, sunlight, shine, right, between, my, eyes/I’ve, seen, lightning, strikes, my, whole, life/I, felt, the, stars, outside, shining, in, my, veins/I, met, the, big, blue, light, face, to, face., Rabenreither, also, mines, heartbreak, on, a, few, tracks., My, favorite, among, the, bunch, being, Deptford, High, St., with, the, lyrics,, But, I, left, her, standing,, somewhere, on, Signal, hill,, I, left, my, baby,, you, know, she, is, there, still,, she, is, there, still., All, told,, this, is, wonderfully, written,, wonderfully, produced, and, wonderfully, executed, album., I’d, make, it, a, point, to, take, in, a, set, if, the, opportunity, arises., Follow, me, on, Twitter, at, @WoodyHearYa, or, @HearYa, Gold, Star, is,

takes, us, down, on, Capacity, are, overgrown, with, a, wilderness, of, souls., These, are, carnivorous, stories,, with, pangs, of, sadness, and, joy., Singer, and, guitarist, Adrianne, Lenker, shows, us, the, gentle, side, of, being, ripped, open,, and, then, recounts, the, second, act, of, pulling, oneself, back, together, to, prepare, for, it, all, to, happen, again., “There, is, a, darker, darkness, and, a, lighter, light, on, this, album,”, reveals, Lenker., “The, songs, search, for, a, deeper, level, of, self-acceptance,, to, embrace, the, world, within, and, without., I, think, Masterpiece, began, that, process,, as, a, first, reaction, from, inside, the, pain,, and, Capacity, continues, that, examination, with, a, wider, perspective.”, Follow, me, on, Twitter, at,
