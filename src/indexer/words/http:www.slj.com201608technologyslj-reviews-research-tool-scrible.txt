click, citation, A, research, tool, that, enables, users, to, annotate,, organize,, and, share, web, pages,, Scrible,, combines, the, push-button, sharing, of, Google, Drive, with, the, powerful,, dynamic, full-text, indexing, of, web, content., The, new,, paid, pro, version, provides, advanced, analytic, capabilities, that, are, more, typical, in, higher, education, management, systems., Like, earlier, incarnations, of, social, bookmarking, sites,, Scrible, allows, for, both, simultaneous, full-text, and, controlled, vocabulary, (arranged, by, words, and, phrases, used, to, retrieve, and/or, index, content), organizations., The, video, below, provides, a, brief, overview., Launching, the, Chrome, browser, extension, or, adding, a, resource, directly, from, your, library, provides, datawells, for, comments, and, tags, for, each, URL,, evoking, the, earlier, ne, plus, ultra, of, social, bookmarking,, Delicious,, but, Scrible, actively, indexes, each, web, page, saved, or, document, uploaded,, in, addition, to, annotations, and, tags,, making, its, search, capabilities, much, more, robust., In, default, mode,, Scrible, has, its, own, toolbar, uploaded, onto, each, open, tab,, a, setting, that, must, be, adjusted, if, you, don’t, want, to, have, to, launch, it, when, you, navigate, away, from, the, page., The, ability, to, save, static, versions, of, web, pages, and, send, uploaded, files, gives, the, suite, real, utility., You, can, share, any, of, these, via, social, media, with, users, or, classes, via, integrated, in-app, inbox, and, outbox, features., Documents, can, be, sorted, by, type,, as, well, as, by, owner, and, date, saved,, and, those, facets, can, be, combined, in, an, intuitive, way., Unlike, other, web, annotation, platforms,, you, can, add, multiple, formats—for, example,, italics, as, well, as, underlining, or, highlighting—to, a, document., Edu, Pro:, the, latest, in, academic, applications, The, Edu, Pro, version, of, Scrible,, which, must, be, verified, via, email,, is, a, bells, and, whistles, option, in, which, academic, applications, come, into, play, when, you, assign, your, resources, to, a, classroom—cost, is, customized,, but, starts, at, $1,000, for, an, entire, school,, including, educators., Class, sections, can, be, added, from, Gmail,, making, it, easy, for, Google, Apps, for, Education, school, users,, but, unpaid, subscribers, will, be, limited, to, a, single, class., Scrible, can, create, a, bibliography, from, website, metadata, in, three, formats—Modern, Language, Association,, Chicago,, and, Associated, Press—with, any, missing, data, fields, highlighted., Perhaps, its, most, stellar, feature, is, the, automatic, adjustments, of, any, citations, generated, from, your, library, of, saved, resources,, making, bibliographic, updates, to, multiple, files, or, libraries, easy, to, accomplish., Scrible, Research, Paper, Analytics, In, its, social, menu,, Scrible, makes, it, easy, to, share, permalinks, to, annotated, read-only, web, pages, through, shared, URLs., The, Edu, Pro, version, provides, 500, MB, of, cloud-based, storage., The, potential, for, caching, files, and, gathering, analytics, associated, with, sharing, digital, content, in, the, Edu, Pro, version, make, the, higher, education–specific, features, of, Scrible, particularly, appealing., In, addition,, Edu, Pro, enables, users, to, maintain, multiple, classes, with, easy, integration, with, Google, Classroom, to, import, student, rolls, and, to, keep, them, updated., This, version, offers, nuanced, progress, tracking, based, on, the, number, of, sources, and, their, type—including, differentiation, between, academic, and, government, sites,, blogs, and, news, sources—as, well, as, a, repository, for, completed, student, work., From, the, students’, perspective,, the, paid, version, makes, it, easy, to, choose, which, types, of, annotations, to, import, into, a, Google, doc,, a, real, boon, in, jump-starting, the, writing, process, with, selected, quotations,, annotations,, and, citations, in, place., Scrible, has, recently, added, a, writing, tool, suite, available, to, paid, Edu, Pro, subscribers, as, a, freemium, service., Verdict, For, students, looking, to, manage, sources,, the, free, version, of, Scrible, offers, an, easy, way, to, do, that, and, generate, bibliographic, citations., Edu, Pro, might, be, a, good, option, for, academic, librarians, wanting, the, tracking, capabilities, of, learning, management, systems, without, the, loss, of, intellectual, property, oversight, that, campus-based, solutions, provide., Wendy, Stephens, worked, as, a, high, school, librarian, in, Alabama, for, 15 years, before, becoming, library, media, program, chair, at,
