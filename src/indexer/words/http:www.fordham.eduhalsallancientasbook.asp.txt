Internet, Ancient, History, Sourcebook, is, a, companion, to, the, Internet, Medieval, Sourcebook, and, the, Internet, Modern, History, Sourcebook., The, Medieval, Sourcebook, is, both, a, classroom, resource, and, the, largest, collection, of, online, medieval, texts., The, Ancient, and, Modern, Sourcebooks, have, a, different, role:, since, there, are, already, ample, online, repositories, of, texts, for, these, periods,, the, goal, here, is, to, provide, and, organize, texts, for, use, in, classroom, situations., Links, to, the, larger, online, collections, are, provided, for, those, who, want, to, explore, further., The, distinctive, feature, of, the, Sourcebooks', layout, remains, here, -, the, avoidance, of, images, and, multiple, "clicking", to, find, texts., Unlike, the, Medieval, and, Modern, History, Sourcebooks,, this, section, of, the, project, did, not, involve, much, scanning, of, new, material, to, begin, with., At, this, stage,, however,, an, increasing, number, of, new, etexts, are, available, at, this, site., The, Ancient, History, Sourcebook, also, includes, links, to, visual, and, aural, material,, since, art, and, archeology, are, far, more, important, for, the, periods, in, question, than, for, later, history., The, emphasis, remains, on, access, to, primary, source, texts, for, educational, purposes., This, site, focuses, on, online, texts,, which,, for, the, most, part,, means, public, domain, texts, translated, more, than, 75, years, ago., In, many, cases, it, is, these, older, translations, which, are, used, in, commercially, available, sourcebooks., But, note, that,, for, classroom, use, , in, some, cases, the, more, modern, translations, are, superior, from, a, pedagogic, viewpoint:, this, is, less, the, case, with, historiography, than, with, literature., In, other, words,, use, online, resources, well,, but, don't, get, carried, away!, Note:, Although, I, am, more, than, happy, to, receive, notes, if, you, have, comments, on, this, web, site,, I, cannot, answer, specific, research, enquiries, [and, -, for, students, -, I, cannot,, or, rather, will, not,, do, your, homework!], If, you, have, have, relevant, e-texts, or, translations, to, contribute,, please, do, contact, me., Paul, Halsall,, Compiler, and, Editor, NOTES:, Dates, of, accession, of, material, added, since, July, 1998, can, be, seen, in, the, New,

possibility, of, a, site, such, as, this,, as, with, other, collections, of, electronic, texts,, depends, on, the, large, availability, of, public, domain, material, from, texts, translated, before, 1923., [In, the, US,, all, texts, issued, before, 1923, are, now, in, the, public, domain., Texts, published, before, 1964, may, be, in, the, public, domain, if, copyright, was, not, renewed, after, 28, years., This, site, seeks, to, abide, by, US, copyright, law:, the, copyright, status, of, texts, here, outside, the, US, may, be, different.], Efforts, have, been, made, to, ascertain, the, copyright, status, of, all, texts, here,, although,, occasionally,, this, has, not, been, possible, where, older, or, non-US, publishers, seem, to, have, ceased, existence., Some, of, the, recently, translated, texts, here, are, copyright, to, the, translators, indicated, in, each, document., These, translators, have, in, every, case, given, permission, for, non-commercial, reproduction., No, representation, is, made, about, the, copyright, status, of, offsite, links:, note, that, for, the, Ancient, History, Sourcebook,, unlike, the, Medieval, Sourcebook, and, Modern, History, Sourcebook,, many, texts, are, offsite., This, site, is, intended, for, educational, use., Notification, of, copyright, infringement, will, result, in, the, immediate, removal, of, a, text, until, its, status, is, resolved., Paul, Halsall,, April, 1998-October, 2000, halsall@fordham.edu, The, Internet, Ancient, History, Sourcebook, is, part, of, the, Internet, History, Sourcebooks, Project.]
