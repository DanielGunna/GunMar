you’ve, searched, the, Internet, for, something, a, little, different., Maybe, you, weren’t, even, really, sure, what, that, “something, different”, was., As, one, visitor, put, it:, I, found, the, information, on, your, site, quite, intriguing, and, I, began, to, wonder, if, I, qualified, as, someone, who, actually, had, a, ‘Fear, Of, Writing.’, Even, now,, I, am, not, sure., In, fact,, I’ve, been, trying, to, determine, if, I, have, a, Fear, of, Writing,, or, if, I, actually, have, a, Greater, Fear, of, Not, Writing., Regardless, of, how, my, current, blocked, situation, is, viewed,, I, know, for, a, fact, that, I, am, tired, of, NOT, being, a, writer., I, am, frustrated, with, my, reluctance, to, pick, up, pen, and, paper, or, sit, down, at, my, keyboard., I, am, angry, with, myself, for, finding, that, I, currently, prefer, to, ‘have, written’, than, ‘to, write.’, Can, you, help, free, me, from, these, demons?, Can, your, book, and, course, unlock, these, chains?, It, turns, out, that, this, visitor,, Walt, Nickell,, does, feel, that, Fear, of, Writing, has, helped, him., You, can, use, the, 60-second, survey, below, to, find, out, if, it, might, also, help, you.,

SECONDS, TO, FIND, OUT, IF, THIS, BOOK, IS, FOR, YOU, My, goal, in, this, letter, is, to, let, you, know, how, my, book, can, help, you., You, can, know, right, away, whether, you’re, in, the, right, place, by, using, these, questions., Have, you, ever, ., ., ., longed, to, write, a, story, but, felt, you, had, nothing, to, write, about?, heard, a, voice, inside, your, head, telling, you, your, writing, sucks?, felt, your, creative, writing, was, a, chore, (“I’d, rather, clean, the, oven, or, mow, the, lawn”), instead, of, fun?, had, your, writing, painfully, critiqued, by, a, well-meaning, person, and, felt, the, passion, go, out, of, your, creativity?, studied, lots, of, books, on, writing, and, publishing—but, the, more, you, do,, the, more, the, fun, goes, out, of, it?, felt, overshadowed, by, the, achievements, of, other, writers?, felt, haunted, by, this, question:, “There, are, millions, of, short, stories, and, books, in, the, world—who, cares, if, I, write, anything”?, Or,, if, you’re, out, searching, on, behalf, of, a, loved, one, ., ., ., Do, you, know, someone, who, would, dearly, love, to, take, up, writing, but, he, or, she, has, been, too,

., putting, the, fun, back, into, writing!, BUT, THE, PROMISE, IS, NOT, WHAT, YOU’D, NORMALLY, EXPECT, Fear, of, Writing, does, not, promise, to, show, you, how, to, write, a, novel,, find, an, agent, or, get, published., The, Fear, of, Writing, method, is, designed, to, take, you, back, to, something, more, primal, ., ., ., joy, in, your, creativity., We, all, secretly, wish, we, hadn’t, forgotten, how, to, play., We, watch, kids, playing, and, wonder, how, we, ever, got, so, far, from, something, that, real., Fear, of, Writing, DOES, PROMISE, to, show, you, how, to, recapture, that, kind, of, joy, and, fun., This, method, is, active,, not, passive—and, that, makes, all, the, difference, to, you., Wait., To, be, more, specific,, part, of, it, IS, passive,, because, you, get, to, relax, and, read, entertaining, and, emotionally, liberating, stuff, (more, on, that, in, a, moment)., But, this, won’t, be, a, helpful, book, unless, you, actually, write, something, yourself., Fear, of, Writing, provides, 112, ways, for, you, to, quickly,, easily, and, painlessly, start, writing—and, you, can, also, use, these, 112, ways, more, than, once, for, different, results., The, sky’s, the, limit!, Now, you, can, use, that, enticing, new, notebook, you’ve, been, too, busy, (or, too, nervous), to, crack, open., 112, easy, ways, to, start, writing, ., ., ., and, that, can, easily, translate, into, a, year’s, worth, of, material, for, your, creativity., A, group, in, Santa, Fe, has, used, this, method, on, a, weekly, basis, for, almost, three, years, and, still, never, exhausted, the, possibilities., Sandy, Schairer, Or, the, fun., I’m, still, so, amazed, at, how, the, Fear, of, Writing, method, WORKS, for, me., I, can, write, creatively, and, leave, my, stuffy, old, left, brain, out, of, it!, —Sandy, Schairer,, Tijeras,, New, Mexico, Jenn, Martin, Just, read, your, first, chapter, last, night,, and, you, were, speaking, directly, to, me!, If, my, fiancee, hadn’t, been, sleeping, I, would, have, shouted,, “That, is, SO, me!”, I’m, sure, that, is, SO, a, lot, of, people,, and, I’m, not, the, first, to, tell, you, that,, but, I, just, had, to, say, thanks!, —Jenn, Martin,, Hawai’i, I’M, A, TOUGH, CASE., HOW, DO, I, KNOW, THE, FEAR, OF, WRITING, METHOD, WILL, WORK, FOR, ME?, Fear, of, Writing, was, first, published, in, January, 2000., In, April, 2014, the, third, edition, was, released., In, almost, 14, years, of, running, writing, workshops,, weekly, writing, circles, and, the, online, course,, I’ve, never, seen, this, method, not, work., One, time,, a, 79-year-old, man, came, to, the, Fear, of, Writing, Clinic, with, no, previous, creative, writing, experience., All, he’d, ever, written, since, his, school, days, amounted, to, some, office, memos., He, came, to, the, clinic, purely, because, he, was, bored, with, retirement., After, trying, the, Storyteller, Writing, Prompts, and, sharing, his, newly-written, stories, with, the, group,, the, other, participants, LOVED, his, writing., The, feedback, ranged, from, “Was, that, a, true, story?”, (it, wasn’t,, he, was, just, using, the, vivid, imagination, we, were, all, born, with), to, “Jim,, if, you, don’t, keep, writing,, you’re, crazy!”, But, you, don’t, need, the, Fear, of, Writing, Clinic, to, show, you, how, to, use, this, method., The, book, gives, all, the, ground, support, you’ll, need, to, unleash, yourself, into, the, stratosphere., One, woman, from, Texas, described, it, this, way:, Marlena, Damme, These, writing, prompts, motivated, a, creative, area, in, my, brain, that, was, lying, dormant., One, minute, I, was, staring, at, the, title, of, the, exercise—the, next, thing, I, know, I, was, shaking, the, pain, out, of, my, hand, from, writing, five, pages., —Marlena, Dammé,, San, Antonio,, Texas, Carolyn, Howard-Johnson, Everyone, suffers, from, the, occasional, onset, of, fear, if, not, full-blown, writers’, block., I, offer, FEAR, OF, WRITING, as, a, remedy, every, time., —Carolyn, Howard-Johnson,, instructor, for, UCLA, Extension’s, renowned, Writers’, Program, THE, ACTIVE, ZONE, AND, THE, PASSIVE, ZONE, The, book, is, designed, to, deliver, both, active, fun, (112, irresistible, writing, prompts), and, invisible, emotional, healing—for, any, writing, scars, you, may, have, accumulated, along, the, way., You’ll, find, that, a, certain, rhythm, comes, with, it., This, is, to, strike, a, balance, between, absorbing, the, “good, medicine”, (without, having, to, do, anything, but, read),, and, actually, getting, some, writing, done, yourself, so, the, healing, is, complete., Part, of, the, “Passive, Zone”, includes, four, short, stories, that, have, been, known, to, subconsciously, work, healing, magic, on, the, reader., Based, on, my, own, intimate, knowledge, of, fear, of, writing,, I, cooked, up, four, memorable, characters, and, threw, them, in, the, fear, of, writing, cauldron., These, characters, first, suffer, deeply, in, rather, creative, ways,, and, then—just, when, you, think, they’re, completely, doomed—they, burn, through, to, writing, freedom., The, Fear, of, Writing, symbol, of, the, imagination, The, story, “Worm, Medicine,”, with, images, I, will, never, forget,, made, the, point, real—personal—alive, and, breathing., Afterwards,, I, went, through, and, in, a, few, hours, fixed, the, corner, I’d, painted, myself, into, with, my, novel., Woohoo!, —BJ, Apostol,, Santee,, California, Jennifer, TurnerI’d, been, battling, a, case, of, writer’s, block, ever, since, the, terrorist, attack, on, September, 11., Each, word, needed, to, be, squeezed, out, of, me, like, lemon, juice,, and, when, it, hit, the, page, it, was, just, as, sour., And, then, I, read, “Jack’s, House.”, Every, obstacle, Helen, encountered,, every, fear, she, had,, every, thought, she, had,, paralleled, my, own, troubles, so, completely, I, was, stunned., When, I, finished, reading, “Jack’s, House”, I, understood, what, I, needed, to, do., This, was, the, miracle, I’d, been, searching, for., Thank, you!, —J.R., Turner,, Wisconsin,, now, author, of, Stark, Knight,, Silent, Knight,, My, Biker, Bodyguard,, and, 5, other, titles, JUMP, IN, AND, TASTE, THE, ADVENTURE!, Fear, of, Writing, Many, of, the, writers, and, closet, writers, I’ve, worked, with, over, the, years, have, felt, slowed, down, by, one, kind, of, fear, or, another, about, their, writing:, fear, of, getting, started,, fear, of, finishing,, fear, of, failure,, even, fear, of, success—the, list, goes, on., That’s, why, the, Fear, of, Writing, method, uses, a, completely, “irrational”, approach, (fun, and, spontaneity), that, works, on, you, before, your, logical, mind, has, a, chance, to, ruin, things., And, then,, with, this, new, energy, injected, into, your, creativity,, you, can, go, on, to, learn, (or, continue), the, kind, of, writing, you, most, want, to, do., But, that, will, never, happen, unless, you, get, started., Every, one, of, the, people, who’ve, used, this, method—including, the, ones, who’ve, gone, on, to, get, published—took, the, plunge,, read, the, book,, and, used, the, exercises., And, they, found, it, so, much, fun, that, it, took, the, boogey-man, out, of, writing, and, made, it, something, attainable., That, can, be, true, for, you, also,, but, only, if, you, act, on, your, creative, desires., So,, what, are, you, waiting, for?, Jump, in, and, taste, the, adventure!, Sincerely,, Milli, Thornton, P.S., Using, this, method,, you, don’t, need, any, previous, experience, as, a, writer, to, get, started., The, emphasis, is, on, fun, and, creativity—not, good, grammar, or, literary, plums-in-the-mouth., P.P.S., On, the, other, hand,, if, you’re, an, experienced, writer, you, can, still, gain, all, the, benefits, of, the, freshness, and, fun, of, this, approach., As, J.R., Turner,, author, of, Stark, Knight,, said:, “One, great, thing, about, the, writing, prompts, is, that, I, can, take, a, break, from, a, longer, piece, (such, as, one, of, my, novels), and, have, some, real, fun!, But, the, best, part, about, the, exercises, is, that, each, story, can, be, saved, and, worked, on, again, later—either, as, a, novel, or, as, a, story, that, might, be, worth, submitting, to, a, magazine, or, writing, contest.”, D’Arcy, Mayo, I’ve, studied, hundreds, of, books, on, writing., This, book, has, proven, to, be, the, best, investment, ever., —D’Arcy, Mayo,, professional, writer,, Sydney,, Australia, Susan, Smith, Milli’s, techniques, are, so, friendly, and, non-frightening., The, book, is, very, laid-back,, conversational,, and, downright, funny!, Even, the, cover, picture, of, the, dog, holding, a, match, to, his, manuscript, makes, me, laugh, every, time, I, look, at, it., The, exercises, are, fantastic—they, wind, up, your, imagination, and, let, it, go, and, then, wonderful, things, happen., —Susan, Smith,, San, Antonio,, Texas, Click,
