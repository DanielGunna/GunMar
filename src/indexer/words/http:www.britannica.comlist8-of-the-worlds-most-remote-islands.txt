interiors,, Arctic, ice, floes,, or, the, vast, frozen, ice, sheets, of, Antarctica, are, remote, places, that, come, to, mind, immediately., But, what, about, faraway, islands, of, adventure? Are, there, any, that, remain, in, this, modern, age? Some, of, the, most-remote, points, on, the, planet, are, islands, so, far, removed, from, other, landmasses, (or, so, far, off, the, beaten, path, of, air, routes, and, shipping, lanes), that, they, are, sometimes, easily, forgotten, by, the, rest, of, the, world. This, list, of, eight, such, places, is, only, a, sample, of, dozens, that, could, be, mentioned., All, of, the, islands, (or, island, groups,, in, some, cases), are, dependencies, or, outlying, territories, of, larger, countries,, and, all, are, remote, fascinating, places, that, continue, to, fire, the, imaginations, of, adventurers, and, explorers, alike., The, Kerguelen, Islands, B.navez, The, Kerguelen, Islands, are, a, group, of, windswept, Indian, Ocean, islands, filled, with, glaciers,, mountains,, rocky, outcrops,, and, vast, plains, of, tussock, grasses, and, mosses., With, a, daily, mean, temperature, ranging, from, 2.1, to, 8.2, ⁰C, (35.8, to, 46.8, ⁰F),, the, Kerguelen, Islands, are, not, the, first, choice, for, human, settlement,, but, the, islands, are, a, haven, for, seals,, albatrosses,, terns,, and, four, species, of, penguins., Spitsbergen, Bjoertvedt, With, an, area, of, 39,044, square, km, (15,075, square, miles),, Spitsbergen, is, the, largest, island, of, the, Svalbard, archipelago,, and, it, is, also, Norway’s, largest, island., Given, its, location, some, 830, km, (about, 516, miles), east, of, the, coast, of, Greenland, and, about, 950, km, (about, 590, miles), north, of, the, coast, of, Europe,, it, is, no, surprise, that, the, island, is, covered, in, snow, and, ice, and, harbors, a, sizable, population, of, polar, bears., The, island’s, main, settlement, is, Longyear, city,, or, Longyearbyen,, which, sits, less, than, 3.2, km, (2, miles), away, from, the, Svalbard, Global, Seed, Vault—a, secure, facility, built, into, the, side, of, a, mountain, intended, to, safeguard, the, seeds, of, the, world’s, food, plants, in, the, event, of, a, global, crisis., Pitcairn, Island, Peter, J., Anerine/Shostal, Associates, This, small, volcanic, island, in, the, South, Pacific—the, only, inhabited, island, of, the, British, overseas, territory, of, Pitcairn,, Henderson,, Ducie,, and, Oeno, islands—is, probably, best, known, as, the, haven, of, the, mutineers, of, the, British, ship, HMS, Bounty,, who, settled, there, in, 1790., Today, Pitcairn, Island, is, at, the, center, of, one, of, the, world’s, largest, marine, reserves,, a, vast, 830,000-square-km, (322,000-square-mile), region, of, open, ocean, larger, than, the, U.S., state, of, Texas., Novaya, Zemlya, Two, large, Arctic, islands, and, a, handful, of, smaller, islands, constitute, Novaya, Zemlya, (“New, Land”),, a, Russian-administered, archipelago, separating, the, Barents, and, Kara, seas, along, Russia’s, northwestern, coast., The, two, main, islands,, Severny, (northern), and, Yuzhny, (southern),, are, aligned, for, 600, miles, (1,000, km), in, a, southwest-northeast, direction, and, are, separated, by, a, narrow, strait,, Matochkin, Shar,, which, is, only, about, 1, to, 1.5, miles, (1.6, to, 2.4, km), wide., During, the, Cold, War,, Novaya, Zemlya, was, the, site, of, more, than, 100, nuclear, tests, between, 1954, and, 1990., Tristan, da, Cunha, Photo, by, Steven, Chown, in, Gewin, V, (2005), Eco-Defense, against, Invasions., PLoS, Biol, 3(12):, e429., doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0030429, The, British, overseas, territory, of, St., Helena,, Ascension,, and, Tristan, da, Cunha, is, made, up, of, isolated, islands., Tristan, da, Cunha,, the, southernmost, inhabited, island, in, the, territory, (along, with, a, wildlife, reserve, made, up, of, Inaccessible,, Nightingale,, Middle,, Gough,, and, Stoltenhoff, islands),, is, located, approximately, 2,100, km, (1,300, miles), to, the, south, of, St., Helena,, the, nearest, inhabited, landmass., Tristan, da, Cunha, itself, is, roughly, circular,, with, a, coastline, of, 21, miles, (34, km), and, a, central, volcanic, cone, (with, a, height, of, 2,060, meters, [6,760, feet]), that, is, usually, cloud-covered., Easter, Island, ©, Digital, Vision/Getty, Images, Easter, Island,, Rapa, Nui, (“Great, Rapa”),, and, Te, Pito, te, Henua, (“Navel, of, the, World”), are, names, for, a, small, triangular, volcanic, island, in, the, South, Pacific. Located, 2,088, km, (roughly, 1,300, miles) from, Pitcairn, Island, and, 3,767, km, (2,340, miles), from, Santiago,, Chile,, the, government, that, administers, it,, Easter, Island, may, be, the, most-isolated, place, on, the, planet., This, 163-square-km, (63-square-mile), island, is, famous, for, its, gigantic, stone, statues—the, enigmatic, moai—of, which, there, are, more, than, 600,, and, for, the, ruins, of, giant, stone, platforms, (ahus), with, open, courtyards, on, their, landward, sides,, some, of, which, show, masterly, construction., South, Georgia, Momatiuk-Eastcott/Corbis, The, island, of, South, Georgia,, which, is, part, of, the, British, overseas, territory, of, South, Georgia, and, the, South, Sandwich, Islands,, resides, in, the, Atlantic, portion, of, the, Southern, Ocean,, about, 1,450, km, (900, mi), east, of, the, Falkland, Islands, and, 4,790, km, (2,976, miles), west, of, Cape, Town,, South, Africa., Although, the, island, and, its, nearby, waters, abound, with, animal, life,, human, settlers, on, the, island, are, few., A, small, number, of, scientists, and, support, personnel, maintain, British, Antarctic, Survey, stations, at, Grytviken, on, King, Edward, Point, and, at, Bird, Island,, off, the, northwestern, tip, of, the, island,, and, constitute, the, island’s, only, inhabitants., The, island, periodically, served, as, a, base, for, whaling, and, scientific, expeditions, during, the, 19th, century,, but, it, is, best, known, as, the, site, of, the, final, leg, of, the, arduous, journey, made, by, British, explorer, Sir, Ernest, Shackleton,, who, first, crossed, South, Georgia, Island, in, 1916, while, in, search, of, aid, for, his, ill-fated, trans-Antarctic, expedition., Diego, Garcia, JSC/NASA, Diego, Garcia, is, a, curious, v-shaped, coral, atoll, in, the, center, of, the, Indian, Ocean. The, island, is, the, largest, and, southernmost, member, of, the, Chagos, Archipelago,, which, is, part, of, the, British, Indian, Ocean, Territory. The, island, serves, as, a, massive, air, and, naval, support, base, for, the, United, States, and, British, militaries,, owing, to, its, strategic, location, between, East, Africa,, the, Middle, East,, Southeast, Asia,, and, Australia., (While, there, certainly, is, a, lot, of, activity, on, this, island,, one, could, argue, that, Diego, Garcia’s, quasi-secretive, military, purpose, justifies, its, inclusion, in, this, list.), The, island, was, once, home, to, more, than, 1,000, islanders,, who, were, removed, from, Diego, Garcia, in, 1971, to, make, way, for, the, island’s, militarization, and, resettled, to, Mauritius, and, the, Seychelles., These, islanders, and, their, descendants, continue, to, sue, for, the, right, to, return, home., Previous, List, 9, of, the,
