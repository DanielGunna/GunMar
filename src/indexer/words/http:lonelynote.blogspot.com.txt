and, as, I, was, laying, in, bed, late, on, a, Sunday, night,, I, was, listening, to, a, radio, show, called, hardDrive, with, Lou, Brutus, on, my, clock, radio.,  When, the, lead, single,, 'Touched,', was, broadcast, on, the, program,, I, quickly, took, note,, as, I, hadn't, ever, heard, of, anything, quite, like, that, at, the, time.,  The, song, contained, acoustic, guitar,, plus, Benedictine, Monks,, plus, hard, industrial, sounds, reminiscent, of, Nine, Inch, Nails,, plus, orchestral, accompaniment.,  Indeed,, it, was, quite, different, from, the, hard, hitting, sounds, of, Korn,, Rob, Zombie,, and, Monster, Magnet, receiving, heavy, airplay, at, that, time., Afterward,, I, recall, going, to, a, faraway, mall, two, hours, away, and, buying, the, album.,  On, the, way, home,, as, my, mother, drove,, I, remember, popping, the, self-titled, disc, into, my, CD-Walkman, and, finding, myself, engrossed, by, just, how, distinctive, and, diverse, all, the, tracks, were.,  For, example,, 'Dirty, Hole', is, comprised, of, several, layers, systematically, building, atop, one, another,, not, the, least, of, which, includes, those, same, Monk, chants, and, Cathedral, pipe, organ.,  , And, 'Three, Doors', beautifully, meshes, Industrial, Pop, with, the, Classical, canon.,  And, 'Here', is, probably, one, of, the, coolest,, cinematic-sounding, openings, to, an, album, in,

crates, of, vinyl, at, an, Antique, Jamboree,, I, was, beckoned, by, the, thunderous, call, of, Jay, Ferguson's, Thunder, Island., It, was, on, sale, for, a, buck.,  And, although, a, bit, dusty, and, well-played, --, particularly, the, title, track, --, it, was, well, worth, the, investment.,  Thunder, Island, is,, of, course,, a, classic, album, of, the, Yacht, Rock, era.,  , Heck,, even, if, the, record, had, been, missing,, the, cover, photo, is, easily, worth, the, dollar, alone..., For, those, uninitiated,, the, single, "Thunder, Island", is, a, tasty, -, albeit, cheesy, -, relic, of, '70s, soft, rock.,  The, instantly, recognizable, guitar, hook, and, "doo, doo, doo, doo!", backing, vocals, suck, you, right, in, from, the, get-go., The, song, has, a, Jimmy, Buffet-meets-Eagles, vibe, to, it;, a, song, for, rockin', out, while, sipping, margaritas, in, some, tropical, paradise.,  And, it's, fitting,, because, The, Eagles', Joe, Walsh, contributed, his, guitar, chops, to, much, of, the, album., Thunder, Island, was, Ferguson's, second,, and, most, successful,, solo, outing, after, performing, with, bands, such, as, Spirit, and, Jo, Jo, Gunne., Now,, let's, dig, a, little, deeper, and, discuss, Spirit, --, an, immensely, talented,, yet, largely, forgotten, band, of, the, late, '60s-'70s., Spirit, formed, in, 1967, with, Ferguson, and, 15-year-old, Randy, California, (who, had, been, in, an, earlier, band, with, Jimi, Hendrix), at, the, songwriting, helm.,  Spirit's, 1968, debut, album, was, as, an, eclectic, a, mix, of, musical, styles, as, any, of, their, contemporaries,, mixing, hard, rock, with, jazz,, blues,, country, and, folk., While, Ferguson, wrote, most, of, the, debut's, tracks,, California, contributed, the, acoustic, ballad,, "Taurus", --, an, instrumental, piece, that, inspired, the, intro, to, Led, Zeppelin's, epic, "Stairway, to, Heaven"., While, the, band, (in, some, formation), would, go, on, to, record, 11, albums, between, 1968, and, 1977,, their, only, single, to, reach, the, Top, 40, would, be, the, 1968, follow-up,, "I, Got, a, Line, On, You"., "I, Got, a, Line, On, You", is, a, hard-driving, rocker, with, a, great, chorus.,  It, has, all, the, workings, to, be, a, classic,, but, for, some, reason, has, gotten, a, bit, lost, amongst, the, other, great, singles, of, its, time., The, band, split, in, different, directions, over, the, next, decade.,  California, and, Ferguson, each, went, the, solo, route,, while, other, members, branched, out, to, bands, including, Nazareth,, Heart, and, Firefall., Spirit, did, reform, in, various, incarnations, into, the, early, '90s.,  In, 1997,, California, was, swimming, in, Hawaii, with, his, family, when, he, was, tragically, swept, into, a, riptide, and, never, seen, again., A, critically, heralded, and, ambitiously, innovative, band, during, their, heyday,, Spirit, lives, on, today, through, their, recordings,, which, I'd, recommend, looking, up.,  , Below, is, a, video, for, "I, Got, a, Line, On, You", from, the, band's, brief, reunion, in, 1984.,  **Bonus:, check, out, guitarist, Skunk, Baxter, (the, Doobie, Brothers,, Steely,
