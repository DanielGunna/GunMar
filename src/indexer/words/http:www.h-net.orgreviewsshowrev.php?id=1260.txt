Vitanza., Negation,, Subjectivity, and, The, History, of, Rhetoric., N.Y.:, State, University, of, New, York, Press,, 1997., xii, +, 428, pp., $28.95, (paper),, ISBN, 978-0-7914-3124-5;, $29.50, (cloth),, ISBN, 978-0-7914-3123-8., Reviewed, by, J., D., H., Amador, (Santa, Rosa, Junior, College), Published, on, H-Rhetor, (September,, 1997), It, is,, perhaps,, a, banal, truism, that, a, summary, or, review, of, a, book, or, article, does, violence, to, the, subtlety, of, the, original,, but, it, is, especially, so, in, the, case, of, this, work:, This, book, should, be, read., Any, review, simply, cannot, do, justice, to, the, complexity,, depth,, care, and, insight, which, Vitanza, brings, to, the, nature, and, relation, of, negation, to, subjectivity, in, "The", History, of, Rhetoric., Only, a, direct, encounter, with, the, text, will, do, justice, to, the, obvious, care, and, effort, brought, to, this, powerful, work., Vitanza's, book, is, a, sustained,, subtle,, irreverent, and, aggressive, assault, upon, the, discursive, traditions, and, philosophical, foundations, giving, shape, to, The, History, of, Rhetoric., Spring-boarding, from, critiques, of, the, recent, works, of, Edward, Shiappa,, John, Poulakos, and, Susan, Jarratt, on, the, question, of, the, Sophists, and, their, relationship, to, rhetorical, history, and, tradition,, Vitanza, takes, us, on, a, labyrinthine, journey, of, modern,, postmodern, and, classical, theorists, in, order, to, clear, a, space, for, alternative, readings., Among, the, numerous, issues, he, raises,, the, most, pressing, he, confronts, is, the, function, of, dieresis,, or, species-genus, analytics, which, inform, not, only, these, approaches, to, The, History, of, Rhetoric,, but, is, the, foundation, of, western, educational, tradition, and, epistemology, as, a, whole., Vitanza, begins, his, work, by, confronting, and, rejecting, Schiappa's, conclusion, that, the, Sophists, did, not, exist,, but, were, a, fiction, created, by, Plato, for, his, own, ends, (p., 46)., As, Vitanza, correctly, points, out,, this, conclusion, was, reached, through, a, divisive,, definitional, caveat,, a, bifurcation, predetermining, the, answer, (Sophists--oasis, or, mirage?)., Schiappa's, answer, is, predicated, by, the, question, he, asks,, a, question, informed, by, an, ideology, of, ontology., As, Vitanza, points, out,, "the, structure, of, the, ontological, question, is, violent, ..., because, it, is, preconditioned, to, have, us, believe, that, it, must, be, answered, (that, it, is, irrepressible), and, that, it, has, a, 'correct', (Platonic, absolute, or, Aristotelian, actual), answer", (p., 49)., Schiappa's, divisionary, tactics, are, related, to, species-genus, analytics,, to, the, determination, of, the, existence, and, "place", (species), of, a, subject, according, to, preconceived, system, (genus)., It, is, this, tactic, and, its, effect, and, impact, upon, subjectivity, and, historiography, that, Vitanza, explores., For, Vitanza,, the, issue, is:, Who, is, excluded, and, silenced, through, disciplinary, practices, which, seek, to, control, and, limit,, through, 'proper', identification,, those, who, are, constituted, as, subjects?, What, happens, to, those, who,, by, definitional, caveat,, are, simply, not,, because, they, cannot, be, identified,, because, they, do, not, fit, within, the, paradigm?, To, answer, these, questions,, he, weaves, an, elaborate, tapestry, of, critical, theoretics, and, analytics, which, simultaneously, expose, the, power, systems, at, work, within, the, foundations, of, his, discipline,, while, offering, alternative, means, by, which, to, envision, a, radically, different, Third, Sophistic., To, this, end,, he, develops, a, complex, trajectory, of, multiple, linkages, from, Kant, (the, mathematical, sublime),, to, Lyotard, (heterogeneity, of, discourses),, Bataille, (sovereignty, and, excesses, of, a, general, economy),, Nietzsche, (Dionysian, multiple, subject, positions),, Foucault, (nonpositive, affirmation,, transgression),, Deleuze/Guattari, (desiring, machines),, Cixous, (depays;, wild,, savage, writing)., He, works, through, to, a, position, of, "Dionysian", excess,, affirmation, and, desire,, as, compared, to, a, foundational, philosophical, tradition, which, sees, negation, and, lack, as, fundamental, to, human, expression,, experience, and, thought., He, confronts, the, pervasive, philosophical, trope, "out, of, the, impossible, comes, the, possible", or, "out, of, the, negative, (lack), comes, the, positive, (excess/desire).", It, is, from, within, his, network, of, linkages, that, he, begins, to, imagine, and, fashion, an, alternative, space,, a, pagan, space,, where, the, exiled,, silenced, and, rejected, dwell, and, are, given, a, place, from, which, to, speak., Through, and, from, out, of, these, linkages, he, turns, to, explore, the, relationship, of, negation, to, fascism, in, education, (historiography,, political, education,, even, everyday, political, life), in, a, trajectory, extending, from, Isocrates, to, Heidegger:, Isocrates', concept, of, the, hegemonic, and, unifying, force, of, the, civilizing, (Greek), logos, provides, the, eventual, foundation, for, an, imperialist, Panhellenism., Isocrates, emphasizes, the, hegemonic, capacity, of, reasoning, (logos), to, unify, and, lead., Through, a, series, of, dextrous, readings,, re-readings, and, stretchings,, Vitanza, traces, a, Greek-German, connection, as, evidenced, through, Jaeger's, concept, of, paideia,, culture,, Geschlecht., Jaeger, argues, for, a, similarity, of, spirit, and, culture, between, Germany, on, the, one, hand, and, the, great, Greece-Roman, cultural, empire, on, the, other,, and, it, is, Isocrates, and, his, concept, of, paideia/logos, as, civilizing, force, that, provides, the, inspiration., Interestingly,, Heidegger, himself, turns, to, the, concept, of, logos, and, its, relation, to, Being,, but, rather, than, seeing, in, it, a, unifying, force,, he, looks, to, the, sophistic, notion, of, doxa, as, in, a, perpetual, act, of, appearance/glory., "In, other, words,, logos, speaks, doxa, which, is, an, unconcealment, and, simultaneously, a, concealment, of, some, aspect, of, episteme/truth,, which, can, never, be, completely, gathered,, or, unconcealed", (p., 178)., It, is, necessary,, therefore,, to, keep, the, question, of, Being, from, ever, finding, a, definitive, answer., Nevertheless,, it, is, this, Abyss, of, Being, which, is,, like, Isocrates', logos,, to, be, our, guide., And, it, is, this, Abyss,, as, a, negative, essentializing, moment,, which, becomes, the, object, of, nostalgia, for, Heidegger,, a, nostalgia, that, leads, him, to, stop, questioning, and, embrace, a, Fuehrer, principle, of, logos/Being, which, ultimately, leads, him, to, National, Socialism., Vitanza's, point, is, not, to, blame, Heidegger,, whose, concept, of, logos, is, after, all,, Greek, and, lies, at, the, foundation, of, our, western, heritage., It, is, a, logos, which, negatively, essentializes, physis, (the, Abyss, of, Being),, which, controls, a, perpetuates, nomos, (paideia-culture),, which, is, at, the, heart, of, the, will, to, truth, (imperialism)., It, is, this, negative, essentializing, that, Vitanza, wants, to, critique,, wants, to, avoid,, in, order, to, develop, a, nonpositive, affirmative, Third, Sophistic, based, upon, a, general,, libidinalized, economy, of, excess., To, avoid, the, difficulties, of, the, Isocrates-Heidegger, trajectory,, Vitanza, turns, to, Gorgias, and, casuistically, stretches, him, through, Nietzsche, to, (re)turn, to, a, Third, Sophistic., Rejecting, Poulakos', turn, to, Heidegger, as, problematic,, Vitanza's, reconfiguration, of, The, History, of, Rhetoric, to, (re)include, the, Sophists, stretches, Gorgias', concept, of, the, logos, through, a, reading, of, excess:, Where, Plato, unifies, (one),, and, Isocrates, divides, (dissoi, logoi--two),, Gorgias, explodes, (many, more,, multiple, subjectivities)., Vitanza, focuses, in, particular, on, Gorgias', concept, of, logos, as, kairotic., This, concept, is, explored, in, Gorgias', defense, of, Helen,, a, figure, which, Vitanza, eventually, wants, to, turn, to, as, an, interpretive, focal, point, for, his, Third, Sophistic:, Can, he, approach, Helen, through, an, anti-Humanist, interpretive, strategy, which, embraces, a, postmodern, subjectivity-through-excess?, Setting, aside, Jarratt's, Feminist, Sophistic,, which, he, sees, as, founded, upon, a, strategic, negative, essentializing, approach, ("only, women, can, ...", as, the, obverse, of, patriarchy's, "only, men, can, ..."),, he, stretches, Judith, Butler's, concept, of, gender, identity, as, a, performative, activity., This, allows, him, to, approach, subjectivity, through, a, "middle, voice",, a, space, between, the, active/passive, dichotomy, indicating, a, self, undergoing, movement,, a, multiplicity, and, excess, of, selves, confronted, by, kairotic, moments, dispersing, power., Here, Vitanza, finds, the, subjectivity, he, has, been, searching, for:, Helen,, deliberating, the, dilemma, of, the, decision, whether, or, not, to, go, with, Paris,, is, confronted, by, the, kairos,, by, the, will, to, power, through, a, logos, uncanny,, strange., Helen,, read, through, Vitanza, reading, Gorgias,, when, confronted, by, the, logos,, is, face-to-face, with, sovereignty, and, the, sublime., She, does, not, act,, but, is, acted, upon, by, a, force, that, makes, her, subject, to, it,, "not, by, virtue, of, a, passive, voice,, but, by, ill-virtue--against, ..., what, is, fitting--of, the, middle, voice, (Hence,, a, denegated, subject!), It, is, a, force, that, prefers--just, as, the, middle, voice, does--to, place, subjectivity, into, infinite, dispersion,, into, a, 'Dionysian, world',, into, the, middle, voice, ..., of, 'endless, desiring, metamorphosis'", (p., 297)., Vitanza, rejects, a, Helen, returned, to, agency, as, one, most, like, to, be, reactionary., Instead,, he, finds, (reading, her, through, Nietzsche), a, "sovereign,, sublime, subjectivity, ..., leaving, behind, active/passive, voices,, sadistic/masochistic, voices, by, way, of, reaching, for, a, middle, voice", (p., 303), What, promises, would, such, a, project,, founded, upon, a, new, sublime,, sovereign, subject,, hold, for, histories, of, rhetoric?, First,, it, would, uncover, the, systems, of, consolidation, and, modalities, of, power, at, work, throughout, The, History, (and, historiography), of, Rhetoric, as, The, History, of, Oppression., It, would, demand, a, fundamental, reconstitution, of, the, project(s), of, histories, of, rhetoric, by, (re)turning, to, the, excluded, (middle), voices,, (re)turning, us, to, the, "dark, side", of, the, pagus, wherein, dwell, the, antisocial,, the, criminal,, the, barbaric,, the, schizophrenic., It, would, denegate, the, negative,, favoring, pastiche, over, parody,, overcoming, the, hegemony, of, onto-theological, foundations., It, would, call, for, an, end, to, philosophical, rhetoric, in, favor, of, a, return, to, poetic/schizophrenic, speech., It, would, perpetually, question, the, claim, of, rhetoric, to, "democratic, values.", It, would, seek, an, excess, of, pessimistic, joy,, healing, and, celebration., It, would,, essentially,, "explode, The, (speculative), genre, of, history", (p., 335)., There, are, so, many, questions, that, arise,, and, are, addressed,, when, reading, through, this, difficult,, thought-provoking, work., But, I, want, to, raise, just, one, issue, in, light, of, the, impassioned, plea, for/by/of, the, repressed, (excluded,, suppressed,, oppressed):, How, do, we, measure, the, success(es), of, an, anti-humanist, dispersion, of, power, and, subjectivities?, What, do, I, mean?, It, has, something, to, do, about, Helen,, about, Vitanza's, reading, of, Helen, through, a, stretching, of, Gorgias., It, has, something, to, do, with, his, accounting, of, Helen., She, confronts, and, becomes,, through, his, reading,, the, kairotic,, schizophrenic, moment., Yet,, she, is, dispersed,, neither, powerless, nor, powerful,, neither, subject, nor, object,, but, left, in, liminality,, in/as, a, way, out., There, is, something, strange,, almost, dissatisfying, about, this., Perhaps, it, is, simply, something, so, new, as, to, be, unfamiliar., Admittedly,, my, reaction, stems, from, an, underdeveloped, suspicion, of, mine, that, anti-humanist, analytics, of, power,, as, important, corrections, as, they, may, be, to, the, ideology, of, human, agency, so, prevalent, in, rhetorical, theoretics,, by, advocating, a, theory, of, power, as, a, network, of, discursive, formations, ultimately, render, the, subject, powerless, in, the, face, of, overwhelming, systems, whose, aims, are, precisely, to, eliminate, individuality, and, agency., "We, conceal,, un/namely,, that, we,, human, beings,, are, not, masters, of, this, situation., Anthropos, is, not, in, charge, here, or, elsewhere", (p., 292)., The, question, I, ponder,, when, reading, Vitanza's, rereading, of, Helen,, is:, As, an, analytical, critique,, do, we, come, to, a, better, understanding, of, systems, of, power, through, it?, Or, does, he, have, something, else, in, mind,, also?, Perhaps,, more, importantly,, he, is, looking, for, means, and, spaces, of, freedom, that, disperse, power, rather, than, engage, with, it,, in, it?, Vitanza's, book,, difficult, and, brilliant,, aggravating, and, enticing,, elusive, and, invigorating,, promises, a, future-anterior, of, wild,, new, (re)beginnings., It, is, a, tour-de-force, argument, against, the, disciplinary, rituals, of, power, as, played, out, in, The, History, of, Rhetoric., Ultimately,, it, leaves, one, desiring, to, see,, if, not, also, bring, about,, his, and, (Others'), envisioned, future, histories, of, rhetoric., This, book, is, a, must-read, for, critical, theorists,, rhetorical, theorists,, historians, (not, only, of, rhetoric),, and, hermeneuts--modernists, and, postmodernists, alike., Copyright, (c), 1997, by, H-Net,, all, rights, reserved., This, work, may, be, copied, for, non-profit, educational, use, if, proper, credit, is, given, to, the, author, and,
