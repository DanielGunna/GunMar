coworkers, are, great,, my, boss, is, also, good., Management, sucks, around, here, but, they, are, afraid, to, upset, employees, so, atleast, they, won't, fire, us, and, they, don't, cut, our, pay,, so, all, that, stuff, is, decent., The, biggest, thing, that, is, slowly, getting, to, me, is, that, I, work, out, here, alone,, on, the, largest, Waste, pond, in, the, world., this, "Tailings, pond",

such, a, kind, hard, working, man, that, I, tought, I, would, definetly, get, along, just, fine., Even, my, supervisor, was, nice, and, even, if, we, had, bumps, on, the, road, he, helped, me, a, lot., But, then..., She, appeared, and, what, I, tought, was, a, nice, working, environment, turned, out, to, be, a, den, of, wolves,, her, being, the, leader., She, is, the, art, director, and, even, if, she, was, kind, supperficially,, little, by, little, I, realized, she, was, a, though, cookie., Never, letting, us, do, our, job, properly, because, she, made, a, big, fuzz, if, we, wanted, to, improve, or, correct, work, that, she, made, and, was, not, workable, in, our, deparment,, always, trying, to, tell, us, how, to, do, things, despite, accepting, not, knowing, how, to, do, our, job., Some, times, she, just, dissapeared, from, the, office, when, some, how, the, boss, didnt, agree, with, her, and, then, she, returned, to, work, with, no, problems, at, all, and, to, continue, trying, to, control, everything, in, the, office., It, was, so, bad, that, our, boss, will, accept, her, nonsense, juat, to, keep, her, shut, uo., Anw,, our, boss, hired, another, person, to, jouin, our, little, team,, and, it, wasn't, a, team, player..., Enough, said, things, went, from, bad, to, worse,, even, if, we, were, producing, a, massive, amount, of, work, and, never, ever, myself, said, anything, to, upset, my, boss..., Actually, he, never, talked, to, me,, just, to, my, supervisor..., It, was, never, enough., One, day, she, decided, to, make, a, bigger, fuzz, and, kinda, let, me, know, to, follow, her, orders, and, do, my, job, the, way, she, pleases,, that, the, boss, was, ok, with, all, that..., That, we, were, compromising, the, game, with, our, changes, (it, wasn't)., Next, day..., Our, team, left, and, not, in, a, quiet, matter..., It, was, awful..., But, it, was, just, enough, abuse,, my, boss, called, me, angered, after, telling, him, of, my, 2, weeks, notice, and, well..., It, didn't, went, well., Told, me, I, never, talked, and, was, the, worst, kind, of, person, for, talking, in, a, corner, and, not, talking, with, anybody, else, despite, de, fact, I, was, always, open, and, made, lots, of, friends, there..., He, just, shouted, at, me, telling, me, to, shut, up, over, and, over..., Then, he, protected, the, new, guy, with, no, experience, and, that, refused, since, the, beggining, to, talk, to, his, team, but, talked, to, everybody, else, refarding, his, concerns., Anw..., The, place, was, always, getting, and, losing, people,, in, the,

now, I, feel, excited, for, all, the, new, possibilities., There, were, so, many, things, happening, there, and, now, that, I, left, keep, wondering, how, I, was, so, stupid, to, endure, that, just, becase, I, liked, to, draw, when, I, can, do, it, anywhere, else..., I, endured, because, of, a, paycheck, I, was, not, even, sure, will, come, on, time..., I, was, just, giving, this, place, the, benefit, of, the, doubt, and, wanted, to, show, my, boss, how, grateful, I, was, with, him, for, opening, the, doors, for, me..., Not, worth, it, and, definetly, was, never, more, than, a, tool, for, this, company., That's, life, and, man..., It, openend, my, eyes, so, much., I, don't, wish, that, company, harm, at, all,, but, all, the, luck, in, the, world, if, they, are, going, to, keep, moving,
