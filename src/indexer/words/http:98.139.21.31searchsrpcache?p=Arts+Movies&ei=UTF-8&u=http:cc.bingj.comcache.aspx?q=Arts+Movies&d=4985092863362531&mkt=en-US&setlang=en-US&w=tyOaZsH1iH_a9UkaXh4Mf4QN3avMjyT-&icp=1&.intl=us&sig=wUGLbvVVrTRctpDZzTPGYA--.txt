and, House, of, Flying, Daggers, in, the, West;, the, use, of, stylized, Hong, Kong, action, in, Hollywood, blockbusters;, and, the, international, success, of, Jackie, Chan,, Jet, Li,, Michelle,

their, current, status, in, the, American, martial, arts, community,, Black, Belt, asked, me, to, devise, a, list, of, the, top, 20, martial, arts, movies, of, all, time., The, result, is, this, article., Movies, were, included, based, on, their, impact, on, martial, arts, cinema,, as, well, as, their, choreography., Before, jumping, into, the, list,, however,, I’ll, note, a, few, honorable, mentions:, Crouching, Tiger, for, giving, small-town, America, a, view, of, the, wu, xia, world, of, martial, arts, films, Kung, Fu, vs., Yoga, for, …, well,, you, just, can’t, ignore, a, guy, who’s, capable, of, whipping, his, right, leg, up, across, his, back, and, kicking, over, his, left, shoulder, to, strike, the, face, of, a, man, standing, in, front, of, him, Magnificent, Butcher, for, what’s, arguably, Sammo, Hung’s, best, fight, performance, The, Sword, of, Doom, for, being, the, best, samurai, film, ever, made, Once, Upon, a, Time, in, China, for, resurrecting, the, legend, of, Huang, Fei-hung,, for, defining, Jet, Li, and, for, introducing, the, world, to, the, “Hong, Kong, kick”, Armor, of, Gods, for, featuring, in, its, final, fight, four, of, Jackie, Chan’s, skinny, Chinese, stuntmen, doubling, four, large-bosomed, black, women., You’ve, got, to, love, it., Martial, Arts, Movie, #20, –, One-Armed, Swordsman, (1967), One-Armed, Swordsman, (1967), At, a, time, when, musicals, and, romances, overshadowed, action, films, and, women, ruled, the, Hong, Kong, silver, screen,, legendary, director, Chang, Cheh, burst, onto, the, scene, with, One-Armed, Swordsman., This, riveting, revenge, thriller,, filled, with, themes, of, heroic, bloodshed, and, violence,, reversed, the, Cantonese, and, Mandarin, starlet-entrenched, cinematic, trends., It, was, also, a, pivotal, transition, between, wu, xia, movies, and, kung, fu, films,, and, it, introduced, the, world, to, the, stoically, charismatic, Jimmy, Wong, Yu., Martial, Arts, Movie, #19, –, Ong-Bak, (2003), Ong-Bak, (2003), This, Thai, Film, Festival, award, winner, starring, Tony, Jaa, (Robin, Shou’s, stunt, double, in, Mortal, Kombat:, Annihilation), is, not, only, the, first, martial, arts, flick, to, feature, a, highly, stylized, version, of, Thai, kickboxing,, but, the, bone-crunching, stunts, and, full-contact, body, attacks, are, also, a, noncomedic, throwback, to, Jackie, Chan’s, films, from, the, mid-1980s., It, hurts, to, watch, this, movie,, but, it, brings, back, great, memories, of, why, we, used, to, love, Hong, Kong, action., Martial, Arts, Movie, #18, –, Legend, of, the, Fox, (1979), Legend, of, the, Fox, (1979), After, acclaimed, director, Chang, Cheh, made, The, Five, Venoms, (1978),, he, made, 18, other, films, with, the, same, actors,, in, which, each, took, turns, being, the, villain,, the, hero, and, the, fight, choreographer., Any, of, those, 18, movies, could, occupy, this, spot,, but, Legend, of, the, Fox, gets, the, nod, for, its, far-out,, ultra-intricate, pugilistic, scenes, and, weapon, sequences,, as, well, as, its, strict, adherence, to, the, true, brotherhood, that’s, supposed, to, exist, among, martial, artists, —, even, those, who, are, adversaries., Chang, is, one, of, the, very, few, martial, arts, directors, who, consistently, captured, this, spirit., Martial, Arts, Movie, #17, –, Three, Evil, Masters, (1980), Three, Evil, Masters, (1980), Although, Masters, stars, the, legendary, Chen, Kuan-tai,, fans, are, in, for, a, real, treat, with, the, film, debut, of, Yuen, Tak, playing, the, downtrodden, kung, fu, student, Ko, Chien., Yuen, is, Jackie, Chan’s, kung, fu, classmate,, and, according, to, fellow, classmate, Corey, Yuen,, Yuen, Tak’s, kung, fu, skills, are, considered, the, best, among, the, “Seven, Little, Fortunes.”, The, final, fights, are, sharply, intense, and, brilliantly, staged,, especially, the, weapons, battle, between, Yuen, Tak, and, Shaw, Brothers, perennial, villain, Wang, Lung-wei., Martial, Arts, Movie, #16, –, Prodigal, Son, (1981), Prodigal, Son, (1981), Directed, by, Sammo, Hung,, this, learn-martial-arts-for-revenge, film, is, considered, the, best, wing, chun, movie, ever., Although, it, stars, Hung, and, Yuen, Biao,, it’s, the, ambiguous,, stalwart, performance, of, and, use, of, wing, chun, by, the, late, Lam, Ching-ying, that, steal, the, show, as, he, effortlessly, glides, through, each, fight, scene, like, an, Olympic, ice, skater., Lam’s, female, opera-character, performance, is, also, outstanding.,  , Martial, Arts, Movie, #15, –, The, Shaolin, Temple, (1980), The, Shaolin, Temple, (1980), Based, on, a, semi-true, story, of, how, Shaolin, monks, rescued, the, first, emperor, of, the, Tang, dynasty,, The, Shaolin, Temple, was, not, only, Jet, Li’s, cinematic, debut, but, also, the, first, martial, arts, epic, made, in, mainland, China, since, the, Communist, takeover., The, film, was, instrumental, in, introducing, wushu, to, film, fans, around, the, world., However,, its, most, important, impact, was, the, reinstatement, of, the, cultural, value, and, historicity, of, Shaolin, Temple.,  , Martial, Arts, Movie, #14, –, Drunken, Master, (1978), Drunken, Master, (1978), It’s, considered, the, vehicle, that, launched, Jackie, Chan, on, the, path, to, superstardom., When, Golden, Harvest, realized, Jackie, Chan, couldn’t,, wouldn’t, and, shouldn’t, be, the, next, Bruce, Lee,, they, teamed, him, up, with, director, Yuen, Woo-ping, to, create, the, first, film, to, show, drunken, kung, fu,, which, was, taught, to, Jackie, Chan, by, Yuen’s, father,, Yuen, Xiao-tian., The, senior, Yuen, also, played, Jackie, Chan’s, beggar, teacher, in, the, movie., Kung, fu, comedy, was, secured.,  , Go, behind, the, scenes, of, Bruce,

well-received, by, Hong, Kong, audiences,, Tsui, Hark’s, visceral, retelling, of, One-Armed, Swordsman, is, an, engaging,, violent,, revenge-begetting-revenge, story, starring, the, enigmatic, Zhao, Wen-zhuo, (the, man, who, replaced, Jet, Li, in, Tsui’s, Once, Upon, a, Time, in, China, films), battling, the, maniacal, Xiong, Xin-xin., Fight, director, Yuen, Bing’s, action, is, a, dazzling, display, of, clanging, swords,, swirling, flames,, billowing, smoke, and, gut-wrenching, sequences, of, flesh, hacking, and, whacking, that, will, leave, you, breathless., Martial, Arts, Movie, #12, –, Zu:, Warriors, From, Magic, Mountain, (1982), Zu:, Warriors, From, Magic, Mountain, (1982), This, movie, started, the, “fant-Asia”, film, craze,, a, mixture, of, horror,, fantasy, and, science,

myth,, brilliant, special, effects, and, comic-book, action., It’s, a, roller, coaster, of, magic,, giant, world-protector, deities,, killer, poltergeists, and, supernatural, heroes, sporting, phenomenal, fighting, skills.,  , Martial, Arts, Movie, #11, –, Moon, Warriors, (1993), Moon, Warriors, (1993), Ching, Siu-tung, is, renowned, for, making, non-martial, artists, look, like, the, best,

Cheung, and, Andy, Lau., Ching, works, steel, slashing, into, pure, magic,, and, just, when, you, think, Hong, Kong, movies, can’t, get, any, more, outrageous,, there’s, a, fight, scene, featuring, a, real, killer, whale.,  , Martial, Arts, Movie, #10, –, Police, Story, (1985), Police, Story, (1985), Just, when, Hong, Kong, martial, arts, movies, were, all, beginning, to, look, the, same,, Jackie,

Master, that, flaunts, his, best, fighting, performance, to, date., Directed, by, Yuen, Woo-ping, and, featuring, some, superb, fighting, from, Michelle, Yeoh,, this, movie, would, have, done, much,

Bruce, Lee’s, The, Big, Boss),, Come, Drink, With, Me, inspired, Ang, Lee’s, Crouching, Tiger,, Hidden, Dragon,, which, is, why, Ang, Lee, insisted, on, casting, Cheng, as, the, treacherous, Jade,
