and, growing, more, comfortable, with, digital, delivery.”, The, rental, business,, which, last, year, remained, surprisingly, stable,, took, a, significant, hit, in, the, first, quarter, of, this, year,, largely, because, of, the, rash, of, store, closures, from, troubled, brick-and-mortar, chains, Blockbuster, and, Movie, Gallery., Citing, the, Rentrak, Corp.’s, Home, Video, Essentials,, the, DEG, said, rental, spending, fell, 14%, in, the, three, months, ending, March, 31, from, the, first, quarter, of, 2009., Overall, sellthrough, spending, fell, 11%, in, the, quarter., The, DEG, didn’t, break, out, DVD, sellthrough,, but, according, to, Home, Media, Magazine, market, research,, consumer, spending, on, DVD, purchases, was, down, 16%, in, January, and, February, from, the, same, months, last, year,, due, largely, to, the, boost, in, DVD, sales, that, occurred, in, early, 2009, because, of, the, Circuit, City, liquidation,, which, flooded, the, market, with, cheap, discs., March, was, rebound, month,, with, gains, in, both, sellthrough, and, overall, consumer, spending,, a, remarkable, 124%, rise, in, Blu-ray, Disc, sales, and, a, 35%, uptick, in, digital, delivery,

the, rental, market, are, expected, to, boost, DVD, sales,, with, a, minimal, impact, on, the, rental, business., Indeed,, some, observers, believe, the, rental, window,, which, applies, only, to, Netflix, and, Redbox,, will, grow, the, business., Consumers, who, want, new, releases, as, soon, as, they, come, out, will, have, to, shell, out, more, money, to, buy, them,, while, fans, of, renting, movies, will, simply, rent, something, else, instead, of, foregoing, the, experience, altogether., The, health, of, the, Blu-ray, Disc, market, is, underscored, by, the, fact, that, during,

because, you, can, bring, one, disc, with, you, for, use, in, a, portable, DVD, player, or, laptop,, while, the, Blu-ray, copy, can, stay, behind, with, your, home, theater., Lionsgate,, Fox,, Walt,
