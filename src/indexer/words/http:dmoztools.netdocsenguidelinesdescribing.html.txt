Date, Field, Cool, Sites, The, purpose, of, these, guidelines, is, to, advise, editors, on, good, editorial, judgment, and, decision, making., End, users, should, be, able, to, determine, relevancy, without, having, to, visit, a, site., So,, directory, annotations, (i.e., titles, and, descriptions), should, objectively, describe, a, site's, subject, and/or, contents., The, main, intent, of, these, style, guidelines, are:, to, advise, editors, on, writing, accurate, and, objective, site, annotations, that, will, be, relevant, to, end-users, to, avoid, flagrant, and, egregious, marketing, hype,, sales, pitches,, subjective, commentary,, excessive, and, unnecessary, repetition,, and, other, superfluous, information., You, should, be, accommodating, of, various, individual, styles,, and, avoid, adopting, a, fundamentalist, view, of, these, guidelines, by, being, overly, critical, and, nitpicky, of, URL, format,, titles, and, descriptions., Editors, should, keep, in, mind, that, while, the, quality, of, the, annotations, is, important, for, relevancy,, the, quality, of, the, links, themselves, are, most, important, to, DMOZ's, overall, quality, and, usefulness., Capturing, the, Correct, URL, Verify, a, URL, is, correct, and, working, by, clicking, on, the, "new", link, in, front, of, the, URL, field., Your, browser, will, open, a, new, window., Review, the, URL, to, make, sure, it, loads, properly, and, it, contains, working, links., Sometimes, it, is, helpful, to, remove, superfluous, information, from, the, end, of, the, URL,, such, as, "index.html,", if, this, information, is, not, necessary, for, the, correct, page, to, load., This, will, ensure, that, the, most, stable, version, of, the, URL, is, present,, and, prevent, false, link, (Robozilla), errors., When, adding, the, main, page, of, a, site,, add, the, URL, that, will, bring, the, user, to, the, entrance, of, the, site., If, the, site, includes, a, splash,, welcome,, or, warning, page,, link, to, that, page., If, the, welcome/entry, page, is, hosted, on, the, same, domain, as, the, target, page,, then, you, should, add, the, URL, for, the, entry/welcome, page., However,, if, the, entry/welcome, page, is, hosted, on, a, different, domain,, the, entry/welcome, page, shouldn't, be, added., Related, Guidelines:, Redirects, and, Cloaked, URLs, and, Multilingual, Sites, Titles, The, title, should, identify, the, site,, not, describe, it., It, should, be, both, informative, and, concise., Good, titles, ...., Do, give, the, official, name, of, the, site, as, the, title., Generally,, the, title, will, be, obvious, and, prominently, displayed, on, the, site., Do, give, the, official, name, of, the, business, or, entity, as, the, title,, if, the, site, is, about, the, business,, organization,, or, other, entity, (e.g., a, company's, home, page)., Do, contain, the, full, form, and, acronym, if, the, business,, organization, or, other, entity, is, known, by, both,, and, both, are, used, on, the, site., Do, derive, a, concise, title, from, the, site's, contents, if, the, title, is, ambiguous, or, would, give, the, appearance, of, spam., Do, have, the, first, letter, of, each, word, in, the, title, capitalized,, except, for, articles,, prepositions, or, conjunctions, unless, they, begin, the, site, title, or, a, new, part, of, a, compound, title., Star, Wars:, The, Phantom, Menace, Cold, Snow:, The, Fluffy, White, Stuff, Sunlight, on, Snow:, The, Dangers, of, Glare, and, Eyestrain, Note:, Since, the, rules, for, capitalization, vary, by, language,, this, guideline, does, not, necessarily, apply, to, all, World/, categories;, please, refer, to, the, guidelines, for, each, specific, language., Do, not, include, superfluous, keywords,, unnecessary, symbols, and, letters,, company, slogans, or, promotional, language, as, part, of, the, title., Do, not, include, words, and, phrases, such, as, "Welcome, to,", "Online", and, "Homepage, of", or, "Website", at, the, beginning, or, end, of, a, title, if, it, is, not, a, component, of, the, official, name, of, the, site., Do, not, include, punctuation, marks, or, unnecessary, symbols, and, letters,, or, special, characters, at, the, beginning, of, the, title., Listings, are,, in, most, cases,, sorted, alphabetically, and, sometimes, people, try, to, get, to, the, top, of, the, list, unfairly., If, "aaa, Website", is, the, submitted, title,, but, the, website, is, really, called, "Website,", the, best, title, is, "Website.", Do, not, capitalize, titles, in, their, entirety., Do, not, end, with, an, exclamation, mark, or, any, other, unnecessary, punctuation., More, about, titles, and, Title, examples, Descriptions, The, description, gives, specific, information, about, the, content, and/or, subject, matter, of, the, site., It, should, be, informative, and, concise,, usually, no, longer, than, one, or, two, lines., The, basic, formula, for, a, good, description, is, Description, =, Subject, +, Content., In, some, cases,, the, contents, of, all, the, sites, in, your, category, will, be, the, same., For, example,, sites, about, businesses, or, organizations, all, contain, similar, information, such, as, an, "about", page,, a, products, and, services, section,, etc., In, these, cases,, it's, fine, to, just, describe, what, the, company, does,, focusing, on, its, products,, services, and, specializations, (i.e., the, subject)., The, following, are, the, basic, principles, for, writing, good, descriptions., Good, descriptions:, Are, concise,, informative,, and, objective,, telling, end-users, what, they, will, find, when, they, visit, a, web, site., Highlight, the, unique, subjects, and, contents, of, the, site,, thus, allowing, the, user, to, appropriately, determine, relevancy., Include, relevant, and, specific, terms, that, will, make, it, easier, for, the, end-user, to, determine, a, site's, relevancy, to, his/her, query., Use, logical, sentence, or, phrase, structure, and, proper, punctuation, and, capitalization, to, make, it, easier, for, users, to, read, directory, listings., Start, descriptions, with, a, capital, letter, and, end, with, a, period., Use, third, person, pronouns, whenever, possible,, and, avoid, first, and, second, person, pronouns, (e.g., "you",, "your",, "we",, "us",, "our",, "I",, or, "me"), as, they, are, too, subjective., Check, for, spelling, errors., Avoid, using, acronyms, or, abbreviations, unless, they, are, commonly, understood, by, potential, users, of, the, category., Do, not, read, like, advertisements,, sales, pitches,, opinions,, or, editorial, reviews., DMOZ, does, not, advertise, or, review, web, sites., Avoid, superlatives, commonly, used, in, advertising,, such, as, "best",, "most",, "greatest",, or, "cheapest.", Do, not, use, emphatic, punctuation, (e.g.,, "!!!", ),, all, caps, to, denote, emphasis,, ampersands, (, "&", ), or, ellipses, (, "...", )., Do, not, give, your, personal, review, of, any, aspect, of, the, website., Do, not, include, excessive, and, unnecessary, keyword, repetition, and, other, superfluous, information., Do, not, repeat, the, entire, site, title., Do, not, excessively, repeat, the, category, name,, keywords,, or, phrases,, or, overuse, adjectives., Do, not, use, specific, dates,, prices,, time-sensitive, numbers,, or, similar, information, that, is, subject, to, change., Do, not, enter, overused, sentences, and, phrases,, such, as, those, starting, with:, "This, site, is...",, "Site, includes, ...", or, ending, with, "etc.",, "and, more"., Do, not, include:, street/mailing, and, e-mail, addresses,, nearest, intersection/highway, exit,, telephone/fax, numbers,, instructions, for, use, of, answering, systems,, hours, of, operation,, prices,, or, other, URLs., Do, not, make, reference, to, illegally, obtained, content, (e.g., pirated, versions, of, software, and, music)., May, include, limited, quotations, from, a, site, (such, as, a, brief, quotation, from, a, site's, about, page, or, similar, informational, areas), if, paraphrasing, proves, too, difficult., More, about, describing, sites,, including, examples., DMOZ, Note, Field, Also, known, as, "editor, notes",, this, field, is, available, for, an, editor, to, communicate, pertinent, information, about, a, web, site, to, fellow, editors., Examples, of, some, of, the, types, of, comments, appropriate, for, this, field, are:, Moving, to, another, Category, (e.g., Moving, this, site, [because, ...];, already, listed, more, appropriately, in, Some/Other/Category)., Providing, information, about, the, site, for, other, editors, (e.g., "Under, Construction", "Affiliate, of, [URL]")., Deleting, unreviewed, sites, (e.g., Already, more, appropriately, listed, in, Some/Other/Category)., Deleting, listed, sites, (e.g., "Duplicate, of, http://www.some.site/, also, listed, in, this, category,", "Deeplink, of, site, already, listed, in, parent, category.")., When, adding,, deleting,, and, moving, sites,, or, changing, a, listing's, URL,, automatic, notes, document, the, action., However,, you, should, mention, a, reason, so, your, actions, are, clear, to, other, editors, who, may, edit, the, URL., A, reason, must, be, given, when, deleting, a, site., Sort, Date, Field, The, date, field, may, be, used, for, the, media, publication, date, of, items, such, as, articles, and, reviews,, or, for, time, limited, events, such, as, conferences., Site, listings, with, a, date, are, sorted, by, this, date, (not, alphabetically)., They, are, placed, together, at, the, bottom, of, the, page,, below, listings, that, do, not, have, a, date., A, site, with, a, date, cannot, be, marked, cool., The, revision, date, of, regularly, updated, sites, should, not, be, reflected, in, the, date, field,, as, it, is, subject, to, change., The, date, field, is, not, for, entering, the, date, the, listing, was, edited,, or, for, other, reasons, for, controlling, the, order, in, which, sites, are, displayed, in, the, category., Cool, Sites, A, site, that, stands, out, among, the, rest, in, your, category, may, be, designated, as, a, "cool", site., A, "cool", site, should, be, the, most, definitive,, complete, and, content, rich, site, on, your, subject., The, site, should, also, have, a, usable, design, (people, should, be, able, to, read, the, content), and, intuitive, navigation, (links, should, work, and, be, easy, to, find)., Ideally,, since, the, cool, site, is, the, best, site, in, your, category,, there, should, be, only, one., However,, two, cool, sites, may, be, appropriate, in, some, instances., Editors, may, not, cool, their, own, sites, or, any, sites, with, which, they, are, affiliated,, including, business, or, personal, affiliations., Doing, so, is, contrary, to, DMOZ's, policy, and, mission, to, provide, a, fair, and, objective, resource, for, end-users., It, is, also, contrary, to, this, policy, to, request, another, editor, to, cool, a, site, with, which, you, are, affiliated., Misuse, of, the, cool, site, feature, may, result, in, removal, of, your, editing, privileges., Please, see, the, section, on, Conflicts, of, Interest, for, further, explanations., Note:, Please, utilize, the, cool, site, award, as, opposed, to, creating, categories, entitled, "Editor's_Picks", or, similar., More, about, cooling, sites, Last, update:, Sun, Jun, 05, 19:53, EDT, 2016, Copyright, ©, 2016, AOL, Inc., (Terms, of, Use, -, License)]
