Duane, Verh, Apr, 9,, 2017, Review, From, the, opening, choruses, of, the, leadoff, track,, “Missing, Persons, Blues-, Op.-, 26”,, as, the, lines, of, blues, harp,, strings,, tabla, and, sax, entwine, around, each, other,, each, gliding, forward, with, snake-like, grace,, one, is, taken, in, by, the, fascinating, and, thoroughly, organic, musical, fusion, Chicago, blues, vet, Corky, Siegel, and, company, have, realized. , Long, a, practitioner, of, this, particular, strain, of, genre-splicing,, Mr., Siegel, provides, this, mix, with, compositions, and, adaptations, suitably, compelling, and, quirky. , And, rest, assured,, this, blues, bar-bred, bandleader, has, blocked, out, plenty, of, time, for, his, own, solid, blow, choruses., While, the, cover, of, “Lay, Down, Sally”,, fronted, by, Eric, Clapton, collaborator, Marcy, Levy,, is, a, safe, bet, for, airplay,, tracks, including, “Shadows, In, The, Shoe, Box”, , “Angel, Food, Cake”, and, the, very, haunting, “One”, are, Read, Full, Review, Review, of, Watch, Me, Album, Info:, Watch, Me, Nina, Massara, Album:, Watch, Me, Label:, CSP, Genre(s):, Contemporary, Blues, Posted, By:, Duane, Verh, Apr, 1,, 2017, Review, At, first, blush,, Nina, Massara’s, coquettish, vocals, might, more, likely, cast, her, as, a, pop, chanteuse, than, an, r&b, diva, with, NOLA, inclinations. , Her, form-fit, material,, supplied, by, producer, Morten, Wittrock, and, Ray, Weaver,, however,, provides, adequate, sass, and, posture, to, close, the, deal. , The, solid, instrumental, backup, and, crisp, production, don’t, hurt,, either. , Standouts, include, “Big, Easy”,, “Impossible, To, Resist”, and, “All, That, I’ll, Ever, Need”., Read, Full, Review, Review, of, Here, on, Earth, Album, Info:, Here, on, Earth, Jenny, Scheinman, Album:, Here, on, Earth, Label:, Royal, Potato, Family, Genre(s):, Americana, CountryTraditional, Folk, Posted, By:, Duane, Verh, Mar, 27,, 2017, Review, With, much, of, its, content, actually, written, for, film,, fiddler, Jenny, Scheinman’s, instrumental, set, is, perhaps, unsurprisingly, evocative, of, vistas, and, tableaux; in, this, case,, sketches, and, scenes, of, vintage, Americana. , Scheinman, often, plays, out, her, tuneful,, roots-bound, themes, as, “rounds”,, each, cycle, building, on, the, last, typically, with, layers, of, engaging, guitar, and, banjo, counterpoint, courtesy, of, a, cast, including, Bill, Frisell, and, Robbie, Fulks., Melodies, range, from, light, and, lilting-, “Rowan”, to, bluesy-, “Delinquent, Bill”, to, downright, haunting-, “Pent, Up, Polly”, with, a, number, of, engaging, stops, in, between.,  The, elegant, waltz-timed, "The, Road, To, Manila", is, a, standout, gem.,  ,  , Read, Full, Review, Review, of, Migration, Blues, Album, Info:, Migration, Blues, Eric, Bibb, Album:, Migration, Blues, Label:, Stony, Plain, Genre(s):, Acoustic, Blues, Posted, By:, Duane, Verh, Mar, 22,, 2017, Review, Nowhere, on, the, planet, does, the, blues, tradition, thrive, so, robustly, as, a, living,, breathing, force, than, in, the, work, of, Eric, Bibb. , Firmly, grounded, in, its, roots,, the, durable, and, prolific, singer/guitarist’s, originals, and, adaptations-, and, his, performances, of, same-, make, an, inarguable, case, for, the, blues, as, powerful, contemporary, expression, acutely, conscious, of, its, past., Mr., Bibb’s, current, offering, is, primarily, a, trio, affair,, ably, assisted, by, guitarist, Michael, Jerome, Browne, and, harmonica, player, JJ, Milteau. , The, threesome’s, chemistry, generates, a, constant, incandescence,, adding, just, the, proper, amount, of, heat, underneath, Bibb’s, tales, of, folks, on, the, move,, most, often, not, by, choice. , Originals, “Delta, Getaway”,, “Prayin’, For, Shore”, and, the, title, track, stand, out,, as, does, a, haunting, take, on, Dylan’s, “Masters, Of, War”. , Read, Full, Review, Review, of, From, Where, I, Started, Album, Info:, From, Where, I, Started, Sera, Cahoone, Album:, From, Where, I, Started, Label:, Lady, Muleskinner, Genre(s):, Americana, Country, Posted, By:, Duane, Verh, Mar, 17,, 2017, Review,  , Love’s, ups, and, downs, are, treated, to, graceful, and, charmingly, modest, readings, in, the, words, and, melodies, of, Sera, Cahoone’s, originals. , The, Seattle-based, singer/multi-instrumentalist, projects, an, ultimately, optimistic, persona, despite, the, inevitable, tumbles, and, falls, romance, provides. , “Better, Woman”, is, a, strong, airplay, contender, , Standing, out, as, well, are, “Up, To, Me”,, “Taken, Its, Toll”, and, “Not, Like, I”. ,  , Read, Full, Review, Latest, Articles, Press, Release:, WSM, Radio's, Sam, Rochford, Releases, Debut, Single, And, Video,, "So, Easy", Apr, 1,, 2017, -,
