Markets, Change,, Buildings, Don’t., They, Could., Some, Should., In, many, development, circumstances,, first, construction, maximizes, development, potential, based, upon, financial, feasibility, or, highest, and, best, use, at, that, time., But, this, often, occurs, at, a, time, when, a, local, market, is, in, a, low, activity,, low, value, phase, of, its, life, cycle—such, as, in, suburban, edge, areas, and, the, beginning, of, urban, redevelopment., Low, sales, prices, or, lease, rates, generally, limit, construction, types, to, low, density,, because, high, density, construction, is, more, expensive, and, not, feasible., Once, designed,, entitled,, financed,, and, occupied,, buildings, and, their, obligations, have, lives, of, 20, to, 80, or, more, years,, a, long-term, commitment.,  ,  ,  …, +, Let’s, Pre-Plan, Density…So, That, We, Can, Accomplish, It, By, Mark, Smith, —, Planned, Densification, is, a, process, to, overcome, property-level, economic, obstacles, to, accomplishing, higher, density, real, estate, development., Because, of, high, overall, construction, costs,, decreasing, market, prices,, and, troubled, municipal, finances—higher, density, development, is, now, getting, more, difficult, to, accomplish, at, a, time, when, density, is, increasingly, important, for, economic, development, and, environmental, preservation., “Markets, Change,, Buildings, Don’t”,  The, Problem:, In-Place, Construction, Being, Out-of-Sync, with, Surrounding, Markets, Especially, in, key, locations,, there, is, an, entire, layer, economic, and, environmental, value, that, is, now, lost, because, of, the, value, and, timing, relationship, between, in-place, construction, and, its, surrounding, market., (Please, see, a, blog, post, about, Asynchrony, for, a, graphic, description.), Most, new, construction…, +, The, Problem, of, Asynchrony, and, the, Wedge, By, Mark, Smith, —, Low-density, development, is, often, result, of, the, match, between, local, market, conditions, and, the, financial, feasibility, determination, for, a, building, or, project., Most, instances, of, new, construction, occur, in, what, Pario, calls, low, activity,, low, value, markets., Low, value, markets, produce, low, revenue, to, developers,, and, low, revenue, does, not, support, sufficient, density, to, yield, productive, urban, neighborhoods., This, is, a, primary, cause, of, sprawl, and, it, is, too, little, understood., If, a, one, or, two, story, building, is, constructed,, its, economic, and, environmental, characteristics, and, performance, are, relatively, fixed., See, the, green, area, in, Exhibit, 1.,  , The, problem, is, that, losses, from, asynchrony, can, begin, shortly, thereafter, as, the…, +, Management, Functional, Span, of, Control, &, Organizational, Change, By, Mark, Smith, Here, is, a, photograph, of, a, functional, span, of, control, illustration,, from, an, impromptu, discussion, about, organizational, change, in, real, estate, development…,  , We, are, often, asked, about, change—questions, like, ‘how, can, my, organization, change, to, accomplish, your, recommendations?’, or, ‘why, don’t, developers, do, it, this, way, or, that, way?’, Narrow, Span, of, Functional, and, Process, Control, Though, the, details, of, the, reasoning, can, be, complex,, there, is, one, high-level, concept, that, is, important, and, easy, to, understand., It, is, management’s, span, of, control, over, organizational, functions., In, real, estate,, management’s, functional, span, of, control, is, in, most, cases, narrow—in, other, words,, many, processes, and, decisions, that, determine, outcomes, are, not, in…, +, The, New, Proforma, —, After, the, Collapse, By, Mark, Smith, Urban, development, entered, a, new, era, in, the, mid, 1990s, as, consumers, and, developers, began, to, embrace, higher, density, development, in, urban, locations., This, is, an, important, trend, that, promises, better, ecological, outcomes, and, better, economic, outcomes, for, both, municipalities, and, consumers., However,, the, current, economic, recession, poses, a, problem, relative, to, the, much-heralded, urban, renaissance., The, problem, is, in, what, I’ll, call, the, New, Proforma,, which, is, facing, a, ‘new, balance’, between, costs, and, revenues., During, most, of, the, approximately, ten-year, urban, renaissance,, construction, costs, were, relatively, low,, even, for, the, newly, embraced, mid-rise, buildings, and, their, accompanying, parking, structures.,  And, while, construction, costs, were, relatively, low,, compared, with, today,, the…, +, Pages, ABOUT, WHAT, WE, DO, CLIENTS, NEWS, WRITING, &, SPEAKING, PROGRAMS, Client, Access, Contact, Recent, Posts,
