to, pitch, a, cartoon, by, Erica, Hughes, By, E., Hughes,  , March, 2005, Pitching, a, cartoon, series, to, a, network, is, Hollywood’s, “backdoor”, because cable, networks, are, more, open, to, unsolicited, material, and, unproduced, writers, than, other, markets, in, the, entertainment, industry., When, you, pitch, a, cartoon, you, have, more, creative, freedom, than, a, writer, presenting, a, screenplay, for, a, live, action, television, series, or, movie, and, could, easily, become, the, head, writer, for, the, duration, of, your, show., If, this, is, your, cup, of, the, tea,, the, question, you, might, be, asking, now,, is, what, do, I, do, next?, (4/15/16, update: please, note,, the, following, steps, also, apply, to , pitching, a, live, action, television, series, with, some,

programs, out, there, (See, below)., You, will, first, need, a, high, concept, plot…, for, example,, take the, Power, Puff, Girls, on, Cartoon, Network. , The, Powerpuff, Girls, is, about, a, scientist, who, mixes, a, potent, brew, of, “Sugar, and, spice,, and, everything, nice”, thus, inventing, three, adorable , little, girls, who, happen, to, have, superpowers, and, must, save, “Townsville” , from, big, ugly, monsters., This, is, your, outside, story., The, inside, story?, The, three, adorable, girls, trying, to, get, the, professor, and, “Miss, Keane”, to, go, on, a, date., The, Powerpuff, Girls, is, an, action/comedy., An, example, of, an, action/drama, would, be, Dragon, Ball, Z, or, The, Avatar., To, pitch, your, idea,, you’ll, need, to, include, a, few, important,

networks, prefer, a, 22, or, 23, page, script, for, a, thirty-minute, program, (but, only, 23, pages, since, there, would, likely, be, commercials)., Your, next, step, is, writing, a, thirteen, episode, outline, which, is, usually, called, a, “bible”., Each, episode, must, include, a, beginning,, middle,, and, end., To, convince, a, network, to, use, your, cartoon, series, will, require,
