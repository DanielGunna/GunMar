(which, currently, lists, 1521, OA, periodicals,, containing, a, little, over, 50,000, articles),, and, estimate, what, proportion, of, these, titles, expose, metadata, in, standard, formats, that, would, enable, harvesting, in, a, form, amenable, to, import, into, library, catalogues., A, certain, amount, of, iteration, and, even, manual, curation, of, data, is, likely, to, be, necessary., The, intermediate, dataset, will, need, to, be, updated, and, incremented, over, time,, rather, than, overwritten, entirely, on, each, import., Intermediate, data, format:, We, will, also, decide, on, the, intermediate, format, (containing, MARC, data),, which, in, addition, to, being, ingested, by, the, Combined, Library, will, be, made, available, for, use, by, other, libraries, (e.g., NYU, Library, and, the, German, Archaeological, Institute’s, Zenon, catalogue)., The, addition, of, catalogued, OA, serials, and, articles, to, the, library, catalogue, will, significantly, contribute, to, the, research, practice, of, scholars, and, other, library, users,, enabling, new, research, outputs, from, the, Institute, and, enhancing, the, open, access, policy, of, the, School., Further, OA, indexes:, Once, the, proof-of-concept, is, in, place,, and, data, is, being, harvested, from, AWOL, (and, tested, that, they, update, rather, than, overwriting, or, duplicating, pre-existing, titles),, we, shall, experiment, with, harvesting, similar, data, from, other, indexes, of, OA, content,, such, as, DOAJ,, OLH,, Persée,, DialNet,, TOCS-IN,, and, perhaps, even, institutional, repositories., Publish, open, access, software:, All, code, for, harvesting, OA, serials, and, articles,, and, for, ingest, by, library, catalogues, will, be, made, available, through, Github., This, code, will, then, be, available, for, updating, the, intermediate, data, to, take, advantage, of, new, titles, that, are, added, to, AWOL, and, other, resources,, and, new, issues, of, serials, that, are, already, listed., This, will, enable, reuse, of, our, scripts, and, data, by, other, libraries, and, similar, institutions., By, the, end, of, the, pilot, project,, we, will, have:, made, available, and, documented, the, intermediate, dataset, and, harvesting, and, ingest, code;, performed, a, test, ingest, of, the, data, into, the, ICS, library, catalogue;, engaged, known, (NYU,,

We, consider, this, project, to, be, a, pilot, for, further, work,, for, which, we, intend, to, seek, external, funding, once, a, proof, of, concept, is, in, place., We, hope, to, be, able, to, build, on, this, first, phase, of, work, by:, extending, the, methods, to, other, disciplines,, especially, those, covered, by, the, other, institute, libraries, in, SAS;, enabling, the, harvest, of,
