[Welcome, to, our, gallery, of, world, musical, instruments., Below, you, will, find, a, growing, number, of, instruments, that, form, part, of, Randy, Raine-Reusch's, collection., There, are, a, few, instruments, that, are, displayed, that, are, in, collections, by, other, world, musicians, in, the, Vancouver,, Canada, area, as, well., These, instruments, have, been, collected, around, the, world, or, have, been, brought, as, gifts, to, Vancouver., Almost, all, of, these, instruments, are, in, active, use., Due, to, space, restrictions, we, cannot, put, sounds, up, for, all, the, instruments,, but, there, are, sounds, samples, of, the, free, reeds, and, a, few, others., As, we, grow, we, hope, to, put, more, sound, samples, up., We, appreciate, any, and, all, comments,, corrections, and, feedback, that, you, may, want, to, send, us., Please, check, back, regularly, to, see, the, new, additions., Some, instruments, are, for, sale, on-line., The, instruments, are, listed, under, the, following, categories:, Fiddles,, Spike, Fiddles, and, Bowed, Rebabs, Spike, fiddles, are, found, throughout, Africa, and, Asia,, characterized, by, a, thin, body, or, spike, and, a, small, resonator, close, to, the, tail,, and, played, upright, in, the, lap., Traditionally, made, with, rattan, strings, they, now, usually, have, metal, strings., Bowed, rebabs,, common, throughout, Europe, and, Asia,, have, much, larger, bodies, with, either, hide, or, wood, tops., They, are, characterized, by, cutaways, for, the, bow, much, like, on, the, violin., Instruments, included, so, far, on, this, site, are:, Erhu, -, China, Goge, -, Nigeria, Koni, -, Vietnam, Ravanhatta, -, India, Rebab, -, Java,, Indonesia, Flutes, There, are, three, main, categories, of, mouth, flutes: , oblique,, transverse, and, endblown., Oblique, flutes, are, common, throughout, west, Asia,, eastern, Europe, and, north, Africa., They, are, often, a, single, hollow, pipe, with, finger, holes., They, are, played, by, placing, the, top, end, of, the, pipe, to, the, lips, are, an, oblique, angle, and, blowing, softly, with, a, thin, stream, of, air., Turkish, versions, have, mouthpieces,, yet, follow, the, same, principle., Transverse, flutes, are, presently, found, throughout, the, world, due, to, the, orchestral, 'silver', flute., Versions, made, from, bamboo,, or, wood, are, common, to, many, cultures., Three, subsections, of, endblown, flutes, are, fipple, or, duct, flutes;, panflutes;, and, 'free-air', flutes., Duct, flutes, are, found, in, Europe,, Asia,, Africa,, and, the, Americas, and, are, characterized, by, a, fipple, that, directs, are, to, a, sharp, edge, as, in, a, recorder. , Pan, flutes, are, a, either, an, open, or, closed, ended, hollow, pipe, that, is, blown, into, from, an, open, end,, like, blowing, into, a, pop, bottle., Endblown, 'free-air', flutes, are, common, throughout, Asia,, parts, of, Africa, and, South, America, , the, best-known, example, is, the, Japanese, shakuhachi., Although, now, very, rare, and, thought, an, oddity,, nose, flutes, were, a, very, important, part, of, many, cultures, throughout, the, Pacific, region, and, parts, of, Asia., Instruments, included, so, far, on, this, site, are:, Dizi, -, China, Fujara, -, Slovakia, Maceno, -, Bolivia, Muhusenoi, -, Venezuela, Ney, -, Egyptian, -, Egypt, Ney, -Persian, -, Iran, Ney, -,

into, long-necked, and, short-necked, lutes,, but, also, included, are, boat, lutes, in, this, listing, as, well., For, centuries, the, lute, family, and, the, rebab, family, have, been, crossfertilizing, and, now, clear, classification, is, sometimes, difficult., Lutes, traditionally, had, pear, shaped, bodies, and, hard, wooden, tops., Plucked, rebabs, often, had, similar, shaped, bodies, but, with, a, skin, top., However, there, are, presently, so, many, crossovers, between, the, two, families, it, is, often, hard, to, distinguish, them,, and, both, can, be, fretted, or, unfretted., Boat, lutes, are, a, much, different, category, and, unrelated, in, that, they, are, usually, carved, from, single, piece, of, wood, with, an, open, back., Often, they, are, large, enough, to, sit, a, small, child, in,, hence, the, name., The, following, boat, lutes,, lutes, and, plucked, rebabs, are, found, on, this, site:, Biwa, -, Japan, Dutar, -, China, Charango, -, Peru,, Bolivia, Dombra, -, Kazakhstan,, Russia, Gambus, -, Malaysia, Gimbri, -, Morocco, Oud, -, Middle, East, Pipa, -, China, Rabab, -, Afghanistan, Ruan, -, China, Sape, -, Sarawak, Percussion, Percussion,

Tortoise, Rattle, -, N., America, Udu, -, Nigeria, Free, Reeds, Free, reeds, are, wind, instruments, with, fibre, or, metal, reeds, usually, placed, flush, with, the, sound, pipe., Most, free, reed, mouth, organs, can, produce, the, same, pitch, with, inhalation, or, exhalation,, while, the, single, pipe, free, reeds, usually, only, sound, with, either, inhalation, or, exhalation., Free, reed, instruments, are, found, throughout, East, and, Southeast, Asia,, tracing, their, origins, to, China., Chinese, historical, documents, date, the, existence, of, free, reed, mouth, organs, in, 1500, BC,, with, mythological, sources, dating, them, much, earlier., These, early, instruments, were, made, with, gourd, resonators,, bamboo, pipes, and, fibre, reeds,, like, the, modern, day, naw., However, there, are, two, metal, wind, chambers, from, the, 4th, century, BC,, which, demonstrate, an, early, use, of, other, materials, for, wind, chambers., These, ancient, wind, chambers, also, show, that, the, pipes, were, placed, in, two, rows, identical, to, the, present, day, mbuat,, and, early, sheng, (called, he, or, yu), also, had, pipes, arranged, in, two, rows., The, circular, arrangement, of, pipes, found, on, the, modern, sheng, and, sho, seem, to, have, come, later., Single, free, reed, pipes, have, remained, primarily, a, folk, instrument, until, recently,, and, as, a, result, there, exists, little, documentation, discussing, their, history, or, origins., However,, there, are, numerous, instruments, found, in, China, and, the, northern, regions, of, Southeast, Asia., Free, reed, instruments, were, virtually, unknown, in, the, West, until, Pierre, Amiot, introduced, a, sheng, to, European, instrument, makers, in, the, 17th, Century,, which, resulted, in, the, invention, of, the, harmonica,, accordion,, concertina, and, reed, organ., The, following, free, reed, instruments, are, found, on, this, site:, Ala, -, Vietnam, Bawu, -, China, Ding, tac, ta, -,

string, bowed, or, plucked, and, can, either, use, the, mouth,, a, gourd, or, the, ground, as, a, resonator., Chipendani, -, South, Africa, Ekidongo, -, Uganda, Kora, -, West, Africa, Reeds, I, have, separated, reeds, and, free, reeds, as, they, have, quite, different, origins., Reeds, are, divided, into, single, reeds,, e.g., the, clarinet, family,, and, double, reeds, e.g., the, oboe, family., Single, reeds, seem, to, trace, their, origins, to, the, Egyptian, midjweh,, and, double, reeds, to, the, Middle, Eastern, or, North, African, shenai, family., Some, double, reeds, are, in, fact, multiple, reeds, having, many, layers, like, the, Indian, shenai., Double, reeds, are, found, with, two, body, styles:, conical,, e.g., the, oboe, or, shenai,, and, tubular,, e.g., Chinese, guanzi, or, Armenian, duduk., The, following, reeds, are, found, on, this, site:, Arghul, -, Egypt, Bin, -, India, Duduk, -, Armenia, Guanzi, -, China, Midjweh, -, Egypt, Piri, -, Korea, Shenai, -, India, Ocarinas, or, Vessel, Flutes, Vessel, flutes, are, commonly, called, ocarinas, are, found, in, parts, of, Europe,, Africa,, Asia,, Mexico,, Central, and, South, America., Their, greatest, numbers, and, most, diverse, styles, are, definitely, found, in, the, former, Mayan, and, Aztec, regions, of, Mexico,, Central, and, South, America. , These, come, in, open, hole, and, fipple, varieties,, some, playing, only, one, note, and, others, with, complete, scales., Ocarinas, were, found, in, Ancient, China, as, well,, often, in, the, shape, of, eggs, or, gourds, suggesting, that, these, might, be, their, origins., Africa, vessel, flutes, are, usually, made, from, either, gourds, or, dried, fruit., The, following, vessel, flutes, are, found, on, this, site:, Cedar, Whistle, -, N., America, Mayan, Bird, Whistle, -, C., America, Samba, Nose, Whistle, -, Brazil, Xun, -, China, Horns, Horns, are, found, around, the, world, used, for, in, a, variety, of, situations, from, sacred, ceremonies,, to, military, and, celebratory, music., They, often, were, used, as, signals, or, for, communication, at, a, distance, due, to, their, volume., Most, horns, were, originally, made, from, either, animal, horns, (hence, the, name),, hollowed, out, plants, or, trees,, or, seashells., The, following, horns, are, found, on, this, site:, Didjeridu, -, Australia, Dung, Chen, -, Tibet, Dung, -, Tibet, Shofar, -, Israel, Jaw, Harps, or, Jews, Harps, Jaw, harps, or, jew’s, harp, are, found, in, many, cultures, around, the, world,, and, were, a, popular, 'personal', instrument,, in, that, they, could, be, carried, in, a, pocket, easily, and, played, whenever, the, player, has, an, inkling, for, music., Most, jaw, harps, are, very, quiet, instruments, played, alone, or, in, duets,, however, some, European, metal, jaw, harps, are, made, very, loud, to, be, played, in, ensembles, with, other, instruments., Although, many, sources, claim, that, the, term, Jews, harp, has, no, racial, connotations,, in, certain, regions, it, did, carry, racial, connotations, , so, this, site, will, use, the, term, jaw, harp., Included, are, mostly, bamboo, or, palm, leaf, instruments, not, found, elsewhere, on, the, web,, and, some, very, rare, instruments, collected, throughout, Asia., There, are, two, main, categories, to, these, jaw, harps,, those, that, are, activated, by, plucking, the, tongue, or, lamella,, and, those, that, are, tension, harps, activated, by, pulling, a, string., In, many, cases, both, of, these, types, can, be, found, in, the, same, region,, or, within, close, proximity, to, each, other., The, following, jaw, harps, are, found, on, this, site:, Ankuoc, -, Kampuchea, Ata, -, Thailand, Bungkau, -, Sabah, Dan, Moi, -, Vietnam, Genggong, -, Bali,

The, Asian, bowed, zither, family, seem, related, to, the, long, (plucked), zither, family., The, origins, of, the, prominent, Asian, long, zither, family,, e.g., the, koto, or, the, zheng,, may, be, found, in, the, rustic, Oceanic, tube, zither, family., The, tube, zithers, in, Madagascar, are, related, to, those, in, Borneo., The, African, mat, and, trough, zithers, may, have, developed, to, become, the, Persian, zithers., The, northern, European, fretted, zither, family,, from, which, the, Appalachian, mountain, dulcimer, derives,, may, have, come, from, the, psaltery, family, (plucked), which, finds, its, roots, in, Persia,, or, from, the, Asian, zither, family, via, Siberia., The, hammer, dulcimer, family, from, which, the, piano, developed,, comes, from, the, Persian, santur.,
