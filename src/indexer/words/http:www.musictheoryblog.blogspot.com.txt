[Learn, Music, Theory, If, you, came, to, this, website, then, you, probably, want, to, learn, something, about, music, theory., You, may, be, an, absolute, beginner, or, you, may, already, know, a, lot, of, music, theory, already, and, want, to, learn, some, more, advanced, topics., In, either, case, understand, that, learning, music, theory, is, one, of, the, more, beneficial, things, a, musician, can, do, and, I, hope, you, will, continue, the, process., Why, study, music, theory?, Contrary, to, what, some, people, may, say, learning, music, theory, does, not, reduce, your, ability, to, enjoy, music., In, fact, you, may, enjoy, music, even, more, after, you, learn, some, theory, because, the, more, you, know, about, how, music, works, the, more, you, will, be, able, to, do, as, a, musician., There, are, many, reasons, to, study, music, theory, but, the, top, reasons, are:, You, will, be, a, better, performer., -, If, you, don't, know, much, music, theory, and, you, are, playing, some, music, and, you, encounter, a, passage, that, has, the, notes, C,, E,, and, G,, you, would, have, to, mentally, process, those, three, notes, separately,, and, this, will, slow, down, your, ability, to, perform., If, a, musician, who, knows, music, theory, plays, the, same, passage, they, would, instantly, recognize, that, the, notes, C,, E,, and, G, make, up, a, C, Major, chord, and, they, would, play, those, notes, more, easily, because, it, took, less, mental, effort, to, understand, the, music., Music, theory, makes, learning,, practicing, and, performing, much, easier., You, will, have, more, options, as, a, musician., -, All, musical, activities, will, be, much, easier., Performing,, composing,, improvising,, arranging,, teaching, music,, or, getting, a, music, degree, will, be, much, easier, if, you, know, music, theory., How, to, study, music, theory, The, first, thing, musicians, should, learn, about, music, theory, is, notation:, the, staff,, clefs,, note, names,, rhythms,, rests,, intervals,, meter, and, time, signatures,, key, signatures,, and, dynamics., The, next, things, musicians, should, learn, are, scales, and, chords, (harmony)., The, next, things, to, learn, are, melody,, phrases,, and, musical, forms., If, you, have, you, learned, all, of, the, above, then, you, will, have, a, firm, grasp, of, music, theory., Posted, by, Komponist, Labels:, learn, music, theory,, music,, music, theory, Parallel, Major, and, Minor, Keys, Parallel, major, and, minor, keys, are, major, and, minor, scales, that, share, the, same, starting, pitch,, for, example, the, keys, of, C-Major, and, C-minor., Parallel, Major, and, minor, keys:, C-Major, and, C-minor, The, following, shows, some, more, examples, of, parallel, major, and, minor, keys., Parallel, Major, and, minor, keys:, E-flat-Major, and, E-flat-minor, Parallel, Major, and, minor, keys:, D-Major, and, D-minor, Posted, by, Komponist, Labels:, key,, parallel, keys,, scale, Relative, Major, and, Minor, Keys, Major, or, minor, keys, that, share, the, same, key, signature, are, called, relative, keys., For, example,, in, the, key, of, G-Major,, which, has, one, sharp,, the, notes, are, G,, A,, B,, C,, D,, E,, and, F#., G-Major, scale,  , If, we, instead, start, on, the, sixth, scale, degree, of, the, major, scale, in, the, key, of, G-Major,, we, then, get, the, relative, minor, key,, E-minor,, with, the, notes, E,, F#,, G,, A,, B,, C,, and, D., E-minor, scale, G-Major, and, E-minor, share, the, same, set, of, notes, and, and, the, same, key, signature,, and, therefore, are, the, relative, major, and, minor, keys, of, each, other., Relative, major, and, minor, keys:, G-Major, and, E-minor, To, find, the, relative, minor, key, of, a, major, key,, start, on, the, sixth, scale, degree, of, the, major, scale., To, find, the, relative, major, key, of, a, minor, key,, start, on, the, third, scale, degree, of, the, minor, scale., The, following, shows, some, more, examples, of, relative, major, and, minor, keys., Relative, major, and, minor, keys:, E-flat, Major, and, C-minor, Relative, major, and, minor, keys:, D-Major, and, B-minor, Posted,

parallel, major, or, minor, key, are, used, and, substituted, for, the, normal, chords, of, the, prevailing, key., In, the, key, of, C-Major,, we, have, the, normal, pattern, of, major,, minor,, and, diminished, chords, built, on, each, scale, degree., The, chords, in, the, key, of, C-Major, These, are, the, chords, that, normally, occur, in, the, key, of, C-Major., The, following, shows, the, chords, that, occur, in, the, key, of, C-minor., C-minor, is, the, parallel, key, of, C-Major., The, chords, in, the, key, of, C-minor, This, minor, scale, also, has, its, own, pattern, of, chords, built, upon, each, scale, degree., To, create, a, borrowed, chord,, we, take, one, of, the, chords, from, the, parallel, key, and, use, it, in, the, original, key., For, example,, in, the, key, of, C-Major,, the, chord, built, on, the, fourth, scale, degree, is, normally, an, F-Major, chord,, but, in, the, parallel, minor, key, it, is, an, F-minor, chord,, and, if, we, instead, use, this, F-minor, chord,, “borrowed”, from, the, parallel, minor, key,, in, place, of, the, normal, F-Major, chord,, we, then, have, a, borrowed, chord., This, mixing, of, chords, from, parallel, keys, is, also, called, mode, mixture., A, chord, progression, containing, a, borrowed, chord, The, following, shows, some, more, examples, of, borrowed, chords., Examples, of, chord, progressions, containing, borrowed, chords, Posted, by, Komponist, Labels:, borrowed, chords,, chord,, mode, mixture, Added, Tone, Chords, Added, tone, chords, are, triads, with, an, added, note, a, second,, fourth,, sixth,, ninth,, eleventh,, or, thirteenth, above, the, chord, root., For, example,, if, we, have, a, C-Major, chord,, with, the, notes, C,, E,, and, G,, and, then, add, a, D, on, top, of, the, chord,, we, get, a, Cadd9, chord. , The, following, shows, some, more, examples, of, added, tone, chords., Added, tone, chords, Posted, by, Komponist, Labels:, add9,, added, tone,, added, tone, chord,, chord,
