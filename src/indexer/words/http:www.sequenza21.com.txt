Angeles, Posted, by, Paul, Muller, in, Concert, review,, Contemporary, Classical,, Los, Angeles,, tags:, Sarah, Cahill,, Varied, Trio, On, April, 4,, 2017, Tuesdays@Monk, space, presented, Sarah, Cahill, in, a, MicroFest, concert, titled, Happy, Birthday, Lou, Harrison!,, marking, the, centennial, year, of, the, influential, composer., Aron, Kallay,, Yuri, Inoo, and, Shalini, Vijayan, were, also, on, hand, as, was, Bill, Alves,, who, introduced, his, new, book, “Harrison, –, American, Musical, Maverick.”, A, capacity, crowd, gathered, to, hear, Ms., Cahill,, currently, on, an, extended, tour, featuring, Harrison’s, early, work, as, well, as, later, pieces., The, concert, began, with, 1st, Concerto, for, Violin, and, Percussion, (1959),, performed, by, Yuri, Inoo, on, percussion, and, violinist, Shalini, Vijayan., This, consisted, of, three, movements,, the, first, of, which, started, off, with, a, strong, beat, and, purposeful, violin, line., The, Asian, influence, so, typical, of, Harrison’s, music, are, clearly, heard, in, this, work,, first, performed, in, 1959, but, apparently, dating, back, in, some, form, to, 1940., The, intimate, acoustics, of, the, Monk, Space, amplified, every, detail,, but, the, playing, was, always, confident, and, precise., The, second, movement,, Largo,, is, more, sedate,, with, a, flowing, violin, line, and, simple, percussive, beat,, it, retains, the, exotic, flavor., The, final, Allegro, movement, features, rapid,, syncopated, figures, in, the, violin, and, a, strong,, driving, rhythm., Shalini, Vijayan, shaped, these, passages, into, a, smoothly, sinuous, melody,, masterfully, drawing, out, the, beauty, inherent, in, this, music., Sarah, Cahill, next, took, the, stage, to, perform, three, early, piano, pieces., These, were, found, in, the, Mills, College, library, and, are, not, among, Harrison’s, published, works., Range-Song (1939), has, a, slow, and, steady, feel,, augmented, by, the, presence, of, expressive, tone, clusters, that, were, a, tribute, Harrison’s, mentor, Henry, Cowell., Jig (1939), has, a, somewhat, faster, rhythm,, syncopated, and, dance-like,, as, well, as, dense, chords, that, alternate, with, a, simple, melody, line, that, effectively, heightens, the, vivid, harmonies, of, this, complex,, but, uncomplicated, piece., Dance, for, Lisa, Karon,, the, last, piece, in, this, group, was, written, in, 1938, specifically, for, a, professional, dancer., Harrison,, like, John, Cage,, found, work, at, this, time, playing, and, composing, for, dance, companies, and, the, original, score, was, discovered, only, recently, in, San, Francisco.,  Strong,, complex, statements, mixed, with, more, straightforward, sections, again, serve, to, enhance, emotions, powered, by, the, often, dense, harmonies, and, thick, textures., Although, these, are, early, works,, all, feel, fully, formed, and, typically, Harrison., Varied, Trio, (1986), was, next,, and, for, this, the, happily-named, Varied, Trio,, a, Los, Angeles-based, new, music, group, consisting, of, Aron, Kallay,, Yuri, Inoo, and, Shalini, Vijayan,, took, their, places., Varied, Trio, unfolds, in, five, short, movements, and, the, first, of, these, nicely, showcased, Harrison’s, esteem, of, Javanese, gamelan, forms., A, lovely, sound, rose, up, from, the, plucked, piano, strings, and, vibraphone, to, create, a, delicately, beautiful, foundation, for, the, soaring, violin, line., The, tranquil, atmosphere, was, enhanced, by, a, simple,, steady, beat, in, the, percussion, and, the, Asian, influence, was, clearly, evident., The, second, movement, was, driven, by, a, more, animated, rhythm, in, the, percussion, and, supplemented, by, a, sharp, pizzicato, in, the, violin., The, piano, joined, in, counterpoint,, complimenting, the, precise, blend, in, a, texture, that, was, highly, active,, but, always, reserved, and, dignified., The, third, movement, was, styled, as, an, elegy, and, the, playing, was, appropriately, solemn, and, introspective, –, especially, in, an, expressive, violin, line, that, was, fittingly, sad, –, but, never, melancholy., Movement, 4, was, a, rondeau, homage, to, the, French, painter, Fragonard,, a, favorite, of, Harrison., While, there, was, no, percussion, in, this, movement,, the, sunny, optimism, and, welcoming, feel, were, augmented, by, a, simple, melody, and, the, excellent, playing, of, Aron, Kallay, on, piano, and, Shalini, Vijayan, on, violin., The, nostalgic, sensibility, was, warmly, sentimental,, but, never, saccharine., The, final, movement, was, clearly, a, product, of, Harrison’s, time, playing, for, dancers., A, swirling, feeling, of, exhilaration, was, clearly, heard, in, the, rapid, passages, and, lively, rhythms., There, was, a, detectable, Asian, flavor, to, this,, but, mostly, it, celebrated, invigorating, physical, movement., The, clean, playing, and, fine, coordination, between, the, musicians, in, Varied, Trio, was, rewarded, with, extended, applause., After, intermission,, Sarah, Cahill, returned, to, the, piano, to, perform, Conductus, from, Suite, (1942)., As, Bill, Alves, explained,, Harrison, had, moved, to, Los, Angeles, specifically, to, study, the, 12-tone, technique, with, Arnold, Schoenberg., Although, Schoenberg, was, notoriously, tough, on, students, who, attempted, this,, Harrison, succeeded, in, making, a, good, impression., Conductus, dates, from, this, period, and, is, a, surprisingly, credible, effort, in, this, rigorous, style., A, complex, and, lively, feel, nicely, captures, the, Second, Vienna, School, –, the, phrasing, alternates, between, well-shaped, fast, and, slow, passages,, without, any, sense, of, forced, process., Ms., Cahill, performed, Conductus, with, careful, attention, to, detail,, reflecting, the, high, level, of, craftsmanship, that, Harrison, had, committed, to, it., Omnipotent, Chair, (1940), was, next, and, violinist, Shalini, Vijayan, took, the, stage, along, with, Yuri, Inoo, and, Aron, Kallay, on, percussion., The, five, movements, of, this, piece, were, varied,, but, all, had, that, distinctive, Asian, influence, so, characteristic, of, Harrison., The, percussion, often, dominated, in, busy,, complex, passages, as, a, strong, violin, melody, arced, smoothly, overhead, –, the, balance, of, these, opposing, elements, being, carefully, maintained, in, both, the, score, and, the, playing., By, the, the, third, movement,, the, pace, was, was, slower, and, simpler, –, a, quiet, gong, adding, a, touch, of, the, mystical., The, fourth, movement, had, an, active, dance-like, feel., A, nice, groove, developed, in, the, percussion, that, was, taken, up, by, the, violin;, Harrison, was, surely, in, familiar, territory, here., The, last, movement, returned, to, a, slower, tempo, and, the, steady, drum, beat, was, nicely, complimented, by, the, playing, of, some, light, bells,, ably, handled, by, Kallay., The, blend, of, percussion, and, melody, was, perfect, and, conjured, a, bit, of, mystery, as, the, piece, faded, to, a, quiet, finish., The, three, movements, of, A, Summerfield, Set, (1988), completed, the, concert, program, and, for, this, Sarah, Cahill, returned, to, the, piano., The, opening, movement,, while, rapidly, paced, and, full, of, repeating, phrases,, was, open, and, sunny., A, slower, stretch, provided, some, introspective, contrast, before, returning, to, a, recap, of, the, active, opening., The, slower, second, movement, was, a, bit, more, pensive, and, uncertain,, and, there, was, an, echo, of, Harrison’s, 12, tone, influences., A, nicely, balanced, melody, and, counterpoint, –, expertly, played, by, Ms., Cahill, –, rounded, out, this, movement., The, final, movement, was, faster, and, brighter, –, like, a, breezy, day, on, a, sunny, beach, or, like, a, day, of, vacation, in, the, country., A, Summerfield, Set, dates, from, later, in, Harrison’s, career, and, is, almost, conventional, in, its, optimistic, sensibility., This, made, a, nice, bookend, to, the, earlier, works, heard,, providing, an, enlightening, overview, of, Harrison’s, long, career., Ms., Cahill, and, the, Varied, Trio, were, greeted, with, enthusiastic, and, extended, applause, at, the, conclusion, of, the, program., Hearing, the, music, of, Lou, Harrison, invariably, leaves, you, wanting, to, hear, more, –, and, the, performances, in, this, centennial, concert, powerfully, confirmed, his, greatness., Sarah, Cahill, continues, her, extended, tour, and, is, scheduled, to, perform, Harrison’s, music, in, New, York,, Boston,, The, Bay, Area,, Cleveland,, and, Hawaii., MicroFest, continues, the, tribute, to, Lou, Harrison, with, events, at, UCLA, on, April, 21,, Harvey, Mudd, College, on, April, 23,, Boston, Court, on, May, 12, and, at, the, Harrison, House, in, Joshua, Tree, on, May, 14., Comments, Off, on, Sarah, Cahill, Performs, Lou, Harrison, in, Los, Angeles,

Composer,, tags:, concert, preview,, Hawaii,, Lou, Harrison,, LPR,, Piano,, Sarah, Cahill, Pianist, Sarah, Cahill, appears, at, LPR, on, April, 6th, at, 7, PM, as, part, of, her, tour, celebrating, the, music, and, birth, centenary, of, composer, Lou, Harrison., She, and, I, touched, base, earlier, this, week, as, she, was, preparing, for, her, trip, to, the, Northeast.,  , Hi, Sarah., Thanks, for, taking, time, to, talk, with, Sequenza, 21., Which, was, the, first, Lou, Harrison, piece, you, played?, When, were, you, first, aware, of, his, music?,  , I, don’t, remember, the, first, piece, I, played,, but, I, became, interested, in, him, because, of, my, fascination, with, Henry, Cowell, and, Ruth, Crawford, and, that, circle, of, early, 20th, century, American, experimentalist, composers.,  And, in, the, Bay, Area,, where, I, live,, there’s, a, profound, affection, and, devotion, to, Lou, Harrison, everywhere.,  He, taught, at, Mills, College, for, many, years,, and, lived, fairly, close, by,, in, Aptos,, and, worked, with, many, musicians, I’m, close, to,, including, Larry, Polansky,, Robert, Hughes,, Jody, Diamond,, Willie, Winant,, Phil, Collins,, Julie, Steinberg,, and, many, others.,  , What, was, it, like, working, with, Harrison, on, his, pieces?, Tell, us, about, the, piece, that, you, premiered.,  , I, premiered, a, piece, called, Festival, Dance, for, two, pianos,, with, the, pianist, Aki, Takahashi,, at, Cooper, Union, in, 1998.,  It’s, a, piece, Lou, Harrison, wrote, in, the, 60s, and, had, never, been, played.,  He, was, such, a, gracious, person,, always, kind-hearted, and, relaxed.,  He, wanted, us, to, emphasize, the, melodic, line.,  , At, LPR,, you, will, be, playing, ‘Party, Pieces.’, What, was, the, collaborative, process, like, in, this, composition, –, how, did, the, “exquisite, corpse”, concept, play, out, in, the, musical, domain?,  , Lou, Harrison,, Virgil, Thomson,, John, Cage,, and, Henry, Cowell, met, frequently, in, Lou, Harrison’s, loft, on, Bleeker, Street, between, Sixth, and, Seventh, Avenues, in, about, 1944, or, 1945.,  Lou, Harrison, explains, it, best:, “Each, composer, present, would, write, a, measure,, fold, the, paper, at, the, bar, line, and,, on, the, new, fresh, sheet,, put, only, two, notes, to, guide, the, next, composer, in, his, connection.,  The, next, composer, would, write, a, bar,, fold, at, the, bar, line, and, leave, two, more, black, spots, and, so, on.,  It, seems, to, me, that, we, would, begin, simultaneously, and, pass, them, along, in, rotation, in, a, sort, of, surrealist, assembly, line, and, eagerly, await, the, often, incredible, outcome.”,  Last, month, I, visited, the, Lou, Harrison, archives, at, UC, Santa, Cruz,, with, Lou’s, great, friend,, composer/conductor/bassoonist, Robert, Hughes,, and, made, copies, of, some, of, the, manuscripts, with, my, cell, phone.,  I’ll, give, copies, to, the, audience, at, my, concert, on, Thursday, evening.,  , What, are, some, of, the, other, pieces, you, are, playing, at, LPR?,  , I’m, starting, with, two, unpublished, Lou, Harrison, pieces,, Range-Song, and, Jig,, that, pay, homage, to, his, teacher, and, friend, Henry, Cowell,, who, was, in, San, Quentin, at, the, time,, with, Cowell’s, famous, chord, clusters.,  Then, a, movement, of, Cowell’s, own, Rhythmicana,, dedicated, to, Johanna, Beyer,, so, then, I’ll, play, a, short, piece, from, Beyer’s, Dissonant, Counterpoint.,  That, will, lead, to, the, Conductus, from, Harrison’s, Suite, which, he, wrote, while, studying, with, Schoenberg, (with, a, twelve-tone, row).,  Then, a, short, piece, by, James, Cleghorn,, who, was, Harrison’s, friend, who, suggested, he, take, classes, from, Henry, Cowell.,  His, son, Peter, Cleghorn, will, be, in, the, audience, to, introduce, that, piece.,  Then, a, pair, of, pieces,, both, composed, in, 1946, for, a, performance, by, the, choreographer, Jean, Erdman:, Lou, Harrison’s, The, Changing, Moment,, not, heard, in, New, York, since, 1946,, and, John, Cage’s, Ophelia.,  Both, compositions, reveal, some, of, the, emotional, disturbance, and, identity, crisis, that, affected, both, composers, at, the, time.,  Then, a, movement, of, Frank, Wigglesworth’s, Sonatina,, and, ending, with, the, wonderful, Summerfield, Set, that, Harrison, composed, in, 1988.,  At, LPR, I, have, to, stick, to, a, sixty-minute, program–, otherwise, I, could, go, on, and, on, and, on, with, Lou, Harrison, and, his, circle,, because, there, are, lots, of, fascinating, connections.,  , Tell, us, about, the, concerto?, What, was, Harrison’s, approach, to, orchestration, in, this, piece, primarily, Western, in, conception,, or, does, it, incorporate, non-Western, instruments/allusions/tuning,, etc.?,  , Lou, Harrison’s, Piano, Concerto, is, one, of, the, great, concertos, of, the, 20th, century.,  It’s, gorgeous, and, epic, and, should, be, played, a, lot, more, often.,  The, piano, is, retuned, in, a, Kirnberger, tuning,, as, are, sections, of, the, orchestra.,  There’s, a, great, battery, of, percussion.,  ,  , What, else, is, going, on, for, you, this, season?,  , Later, in, the, year, I’m, playing, Lou, Harrison’s, great, Concerto, for, Piano, and, Javanese, Gamelan, at, MIT, and, at, the, Cleveland, Museum, of, Art,, and, also, playing, a, program, of, his, piano, works, on, three, different, instruments–, equal, tempered, piano,, tack, piano,, and, piano, in, Werckmeister, 3–, in, Tokyo, and, Fukuoka,, at, the, invitation, of, the, extraordinary, composer, Mamoru, Fujieda.,  I’m, learning, Messiaen’s, Visions, de, l’Amen, for, next, year,, and, Takemitsu’s, Quotation, of, Dream, (Say, Sea,, Take, Me!), to, perform, at, Interlochen, in, July.,  And, next, month, I’ll, get, to, play, Lou, Harrison, on, Maui, and, the, Big, Island,, along, with, Tania, Leon,, Ruth, Crawford,, George, Antheil,, and, many, others,, at, the, invitation, of, a, marvelous, composer,, Robert, Pollock,, who, runs, a, concert, series, there., Thanks, again., Thank, you!, Sarah, Cahill’s, April-May, 2017, Lou, Harrison, Tour, Schedule, (Fall, 2017, Lou, Harrison, tour,

Cabal presents, the, premiere, of Ken, Ueno’s new, opera Aeolus., Joined, by vocalist Majel, Connery and Flux, Quartet,, Ueno performs, throughout, the, opera., His, fascinating, blend, of, vocal, techniques, includes, microtonal, inflections,, megaphone-amplified, directives,, and, throat-singing., Electronics,, video, projections,, and, an, architecturally, conceived, set, design, converge, to, make Aeolus a, potent multimedia, concoction., I, recently, caught, up, with, Ken, as, he, was, in, the, thick, of, preparations, for, the, opera., Hi, Ken., Thanks, for, taking, the, time, to, talk, with, Sequenza, 21.,  , Why, are, you, calling, this, an, opera, instead, of, some, other, genre?, As, you, well, know,, multimedia, theater, pieces, are, called, all, sorts, of, things…,  , Following, the, examples, of, Monteverdi,, Mozart,, and, especially, Nono,, “opera”, seems, to, be, an, open, enough, label,, if, we, need, a, label,, so, I, hope, it’s, appropriate, for, this, piece.,  But, you’re, right, –, I, don’t, really, know, what, to, call, it., It, doesn’t, have, a, regular, narrative., It, features, two, voices, that, are, in, distinct, contrast, to, bel, canto, singing., But, I, am, attached, to, the, possibilities, Prometeo, opens, up,, so, if, Nono’s, is, an, opera,, then,, Aeolus,, can, be, an, opera, too,, right?,  Aeolus, does, feature, a, suoni, mobili, (Nono, calls, the, movement, of, sound, the, main, drama, in, Prometeo), characteristic, in, that,, in, the, guise, of, Aeolus, (the, ruler, of, the, winds),, I, move, around, the, hall,, directing, my, non-semantic, vocalizations, with, a, megaphone, to, articulate, the, architecture,, the, space,, as, an, instrument., You’ve, mentioned, that, there, are, autobiographical, elements, in, the, libretto., Since, it, is, fairly, nonlinear, in, terms, of, narrativity,, would, you, like, to, share, how, some, of, your, own, history, fits, in?,  , Memory, is, non-linear.,  Spaces, between, texts, and, texts, in, memory, become, islands, in, search, of, a, place, in, time,, an, ostensible, home,, which, the, idea, of, a, Penelope, represents.,  My, biographical, circumstance, is, that, my, family, moved, around, so, much, during, my, formative, years, that, I, don’t, have, a, normative, sensation, of, a, home., So,, the, idea, of, a, home, is, a, mythic, space, for, me,, one, I’ve, also, begun, to, associate, with, not, only, a, place,, but, also, specific, people, with, whom, I, shared, lived, in, those, spaces, that, felt, like, places, to, which, I, belonged., That’s, also,, I, think,, why, James, Joyce, resonates, so, powerfully, in, me., If, there, is, a, main, narrative, in, Aeolus,, it’s, the, counterpoint, between, the, semantic, and, non-semantic, in, search, of, a, home.,  , If, I, may,, here’s, an, excerpt, of, a, draft, I’m, writing, for, something, else,, which, elaborates, on, this:,  , My, own, language, acquisition, parallels, Dedalus’, in, that, the, trajectory, from, babbling, to, fluency, did, filter, out, a, palette, of, sounds, that, were, extraneous, to, language., As, a, baby,, I, remember, understanding, language, before, I, could, actually, speak., I, remember, both, the, frustration, of, not, being, able, to, communicate,, as, well, as, the, tiny, victories, when, I, somehow, managed, to, reach, out, and, get, through, –, sometimes, purely, through, the, inflections, of, non-semantic, vocalizations,, maybe, combined, with, clear, physical, gestures, like, pointing, or, shaking, my, head., When, I, was, four,, my, family, moved, to, Switzerland,, and, apart, from, speaking, Japanese, with, my, family, I, was, a, mute, child, again,, unable, to, speak, the, local, French., The, burgeoning, richness, of, my, internal, life, was, frustrated, by, this, communication, setback., Around, that, time,, I, was, given, a, portable, Aiwa, tape, recorder, and, started, to, make, non-linear, musique, concrète,, playing, with, snippets, of, sounds, of, my, little, world, in, exile., Listening, to, those, recordings, now,, through, auto-archaeology,, I, discover, not, only, that, I, was, vocalizing, non-semantically,, but, that, I, was, singing, multiphonics., I, was, babbling,, testing, the, limits, of, my, vocal, repertoire,, expanding, the, repertoire, of, sounds, my, body, could, make., Unhinged, from, semantic, obligation,, I, was, freely, playing, at, making, sounds, for, the, pure, sake, of, making, sounds,, developing, a, series, of, dexterous, moves, ancillary, to, spoken, language, –, to, logos., I, remember, how, it, felt., The, complex, vibrations, of, the, multiphonics, reverberated, in, my, body,, shaking, my, bones., It, was, soothing., I, learned, to, make, a, variety, of, sounds, that, registered, different, feelings., They, felt, like, different, weights, of, the, world., Not, being, able, to, speak, the, local, language,, not, having, any, friends,, I, was, performing,, rehearsing, for, my, future, self., The, future, will, rationalize, the, past., When, I, read, James, Joyce, as, a, teenager,, the, tropes, of, alienation, and, exile,, and, the, distance, between, language, as, sound, and, language, as, semantic, medium,, all, resonated, with, me.,  , Tell, us, about, your, collaborators.,  , Majel, Connery, is, my, singer.,  Though, classically, trained,, she, has, a, beautiful, lyrical, voice,, that, reminds, me, of, Elena, Tonra, from, Daughter, or, Beth, Gibbons, of, Portishead., But, that’s, really, unfair., I, should, not, be, naming, names, or, comparing, her, to, anyone, else, –, she, has, a, great, voice,, she, is, a, primary, referent, in, her, own, right., When, I, heard, her, voice, and, imagined, what, it, was, capable, of,, I, knew, I, wanted, to, write, songs, for, her., Songs, that, would, carry, the, semantic, exposition, in, Aeolus., She’s, been, very, generous, with, me, in, trying, out, sketches, of, my, songs, in, different, keys,, etc.,, so, that, we, can, get, to, the, right, voice/word, combination, to, get, to, the, pathos, that, I, want, to, express., Majel, is, also, a, brilliant, project, leader., She, is, Opera, Cabal., She, is, our, fearless, leader, and, most, responsible, for, all, of, this, happening., A, visionary!,  , Thomas, Tsang, is, a, brilliant, architect, with, whom, I, have, been, collaborating, for, ten, years.,  We, met, as, fellows, at, the, American, Academy, in, Rome,, and, we’ve, collaborated, on, installations, ever, since., As, an, artist,, he, brings, a,

history, of, specialization, in, our, related, fields.,  The, full, vision, for, the, opera, is, to, have, a, space, that, he, designs, that, is, something, more, than, a, set, or, venue,, something, more, integral, to, the, expression, of, the, piece., We, are, working, towards, that.,  , Erin, Johnson, is, a, video, artist, with, whom, I, have, been, collaborating, over, the, last, few, years., She’s, an, all-round, creative, force., Many, of, her, works, thread, the, line, between, video, art,, installation,, performance, art,, curation,, and, community, engagement., She, naturally, problematizes, categories, in, her, artistic, output., She, curated, a, work, of, mine, last, summer, –, Fortress, Brass,, a, site-specific, piece, that, took, place, on, boats, and, then, at, Fort, Gorges, in, Portland, Harbor,, in, Maine., Erin, made, videos, for, four, of, the, scenes, in, Aeolus,, for, scenes, with, voice-overs., Voice-overs, take, the, place, of, dialogue, in, Aeolus, (a,

tags:, the, wulf, March, 26,, 2017, brought, the, opportunity, to, hear, experimental, music, performed, by, John, Eagle, and, Emily, Call, at, the, wulf, @, Coaxial, Arts., Since, the, sale, of, the, former, wulf, building, on, Sante, Fe, Avenue, last, fall,, various, venues, around, town, have, been, used, for, performances, and, the, latest, of, these, is, Coaxial, Arts, on, South, Main, Street., The, space, is, smallish,, but, with, the, brick, walls, and, overhead, track, lighting,, Coaxial, feels, like, a, cross, between, Automata, and, Monk, Space., Almost, every, chair, was, occupied, as, a, knowledgeable, crowd, filed, in, on, a, quiet, Sunday, evening, in, downtown, Los, Angeles., A, sound, installation,, quieting, rooms, (2012),, by, Michael, Winter, was, in, progress, as, people, were, arriving,, and, this, set, the, tone, for, the, evening., As, the, program, notes, explained,, quieting, rooms, is, “…, a, very, crude, genetic, algorithm, (i.e.,, a, model, of, Darwinian, evolution), attempts, to, put, two, signals, out, of, phase, and, quiet, the, room.”, quieting, rooms, begins, with, moderately, loud, electronic, sounds, comprised, of, what, seem, to, be, several, frequencies., The, algorithm, operates, on, these, –, adding, signals, that, are, out, of, phase, –, and, with, each, succeeding, generation, of, sine, tones,, the, quieter, ones, are, favored, so, that, eventually, the, sound, diminishes., What, starts, out, as, a, complex, and, robust, swirl, of, sound, eventually, thins, out,, as, each, new, generation, lowers, the, intensity, and, volume., A, series, of, soft,, pulsing, and, beeping, tones, in, the, background, help, to, vary, the, texture., The, entire, process, takes, several, minutes, from, start, to, finish,, and, then, repeats., Always, engaging,, quieting, rooms, is, an, interesting, application, of, evolutionary, natural, selection, operating, on, musical, processes., The, second, piece,, necklaces, (2014), was, also, composed, by, Michael, Winter, and, performed, by, John, Eagle, on, a, specially, tuned, guitar., As, described, by, Winter, in, the, program, notes,, the, “…score, represents, all, possible, unique, picking, patterns, of, 4, strings, sounding, the, same, pitch., such, limited, focus, accentuates, minor, variations, in, tuning,, string, tension, and, string, gauge.”, necklaces, unfolds, in, a, continuous, stream, of, steady, 8th, notes,, and, with, careful, listening, it, is, possible, to, discern, minor, differences, in, intonation, as, different, strings, are, added, to, the, playing, sequence., Some, strings, had, a, deeply, resonant, and, warm, feel, while, others, had, more, of, a, twang, or, a, steely, sound., It, was, a, bit, like, listening, to, a, prepared, guitar,, but, much, more, understated., By, focusing, attention, on, these, small, variations, instead, of, a, pitch, palette,, the, brain, builds, up, a, sense, of, rhythm, and, structure, from, the, repeating, patterns, and, their, permutations., After, just, a, few, minutes,, hearing, these, subtleties, became, almost, automatic,, and, were, not, obscured, even, when, the, quieting, room, sound, installation, recycled., All, of, this, is, more, engaging, than, it, might, seem, and, necklaces, is, an, enlightening, excursion, into, the, boundaries, between, music, and, cognitive, perception., The, final, piece, in, the, program, was, tuning, #3:, I., Ascending, (2016), by, John, Eagle, and, was, performed, by, Emily, Call, on, violin., According, to, the, program, notes,, “tuning, #3, is, comprised, of, various, subsets, of, the, 4-note,, justly, tuned,, chords, possible, in, the, violin’s, first, position.,  In, this, subset, (Ascending),, a, basic, ‘ascending’, shape, is, imposed, where, each, finger, must, be, positioned, equal, to, or, higher, than, the, last.”, An, electronic, reference, tone, is, sounded, for, each, chord, subset, and, the, performer, must, adjust, the, intonation, of, the, ascending, notes, as, the, piece, progresses., The, score, consists, of, a, series, of, cells,, each, containing, a, chord, subset., The, performer, initiates, the, reference, tone, with, a, foot, pedal, and, then, completes, the, chord,, feeling, for, the, best, sequence, and, complementary, intonation., The, result, was, a, wide-ranging, exploration, of, the, many, emotions, that, were, present, in, the, chords, of, each, cell., The, feelings, that, emerged, were, variously,, warm, and, welcoming,, soothing,, unsettled,, questioning,, anxious,, searching,, nostalgic, or, resolute., This, music, is, always, in, the, moment,, and, best, heard, unencumbered, by, expectation., Each, cell, brings, a, new,, but, fleeting,, expressive, vocabulary, –, some, fragments, were, very, vivid, and, others, very, beautiful., The, audience, was, engaged, throughout,, listening, carefully, to, catch, the, next, flash, of, emotional, color., The, thoroughness, of, this, working, out, of, the, chord, sequences, brought, to, mind, the, methods, of, Tom, Johnson,, and, tuning, #3, makes, for, an, intriguing, journey,, charting, less, familiar, musical, territory., The, 40, minute, length, of, this, piece, makes, tuning, #3, an, exercise, in, stamina, for, the, soloist., Emily, Call, proved, more, than, equal, to, the, task,, even, while, constrained, by, a, short, pickup, cable, and, the, necessity, of, frequently, activating, the, foot, pedal., There, was, no, loss, of, energy, in, her, tone, or, hesitation, in, her, intonation,, even, as, she, processed, how, to, deal, with, each, of, the, reference, tones., Ms., Call, was, a, model, of, grace, and, poise, throughout, and, her, efforts, were, rewarded, with, extended, applause., Orr, Sinay,, Jeese, Quebbeman, and, guest, composer, Stellan, Bark, from, Berlin, will, appear, at, the, wulf.@, Coaxial, Arts, at, 8:00, PM, on, April, 7,, 2010., Comments, Off, on, John, Eagle, and,

recorded, opera, before,, bringing, scores, such, as, Lukas, Foss’s, Griffelkin, and, Charles, Fussell’s, Wilde, to, life., Their, recording, of, Thomson/Stein’s, opera, is, a, very, successful, addition, to, the, orchestra’s, burgeoning, catalog, of, works.,  , Taking, Stein’s, use, of, non-linear, narrative, in, her, writing, as, a, cue,, Thomson, created, a, score, that,, for, its, time,, was, exceedingly, adventurous., At, first, blush,, one, might, well, think, of, Thomson’s, harmonic, language, –, relentlessly, tonal, –, and, his, borrowing, of, material, from, the, American, vernacular, –, ranging, from, hymns, and, folksongs, to, popular, songs, and, dances, –, to, be, far, more, conservative, than, Ives, or, other, contemporaries, who, mined, similar, material, but, with, a, more, dissonant, palette., There, is, also, a, component, of, repetition, and, scalar, melismas,, even, counting, that, sounds, like, a, cousin, of, passages, in, Philip, Glass’s, Einstein, on, the, Beach,, that, suggests, a, proto-minimal, approach, to, Thomson’s, design., However,, near-constant, shifts, of, texture, and, demeanor,, which, mirror, Stein’s, approach, to, text,, provide, their, own, set, of, challenges, for, both, musicians, and, listeners:, in, essence,, how, to, follow, the, thread?,   ,  , Four, Saints, in, Three, Acts, is, a, work, with, a, large, cast,, yet, all, of, the, roles, in, BMOP’s, production, are, populated, by, fine, singers,, many, of, whom, are, associated, with, the, Boston, area’s, various, operatic, ventures., The, orchestra’s, playing, under, Rose, is, also, exemplary:, this, is, a, score, in, which, frequent, changes, of, instrumentation, create, a, balancing, act, that, could, undo, a, lesser, ensemble.,  , The, liner, notes, are, well, curated., Given, his, totemic, role, as, a, writer, on, music,, including, Thomson’s, essay, about, Four, Saints, is, a, particularly, nice, touch., Thomson, scholar, Steven, Watson, contributes, his, own, enlightening, essay,, underscoring, the, durability, of, the, opera, through, many, production, incarnations,, from, its, original, —, an, all, African-American, cast, (most, unusual, for, its, day), —, to, Robert, Wilson’s, staging, for, huge, animal, costumes.,  , Capital, Capitals, is, another, Thomson/Stein, collaboration,, this, one, from, 1927,, for, four, male, voices, and, piano., The, text, discusses, the, various, virtues, of, “capital, cities”, —,  Aix,, Arles,, Avignon,, and, Les, Baux, —, in, Provence, (Stein, became, acquainted, with, the, region, during, her, tenure, as, an, ambulance, driver, in, the, First, World, War)., It, is, breezier, than, Four, Saints, and, proves, an, eminently, charming, counterpart.,  , _______, David, Sanford, At, 8, PM, on, Friday,,

continue, to, curate, the, releases, on, Thirsty, Ear’s, Blue, Series, (a, jazz, series, that, welcomes, cross-genre, efforts), and, he, will, continue, to, play, live., That, said,, for, those, of, us, who, are, fans, of, Shipp’s, recordings,, it, is, saddening, to, contemplate, that, he, is, nearing, the, end, of, the, road, on, this, part, of, his, musical, journey., Piano, Song, is, a, consistently, and, engaging, valedictory, statement., A, trio, date, with, two, solo, tunes, (all, by, Shipp),, like, much, of, Thirsty, Ear’s, output, the, CD, is, enthusiastically, eclectic, in, terms, of, its, stylistic, profile., While, bassist, Michael, Bisio, and, drummer, Newman, Taylor-Baker, may, not, be, as, familiar, to, listeners, as, some, of, Shipp’s, other, collaborators,, they, form, a, beautifully, well-connected, rhythm, section., Bisio’s, solo, on, “The, Cosmopolitan”, is, supple, melodically, and, versatile, harmonically., Taylor-Baker’s, snare, filigrees, and, drum, fills, considerably, enliven, both, that, tune, and, “Flying, Carpet.”, The, rhythm, section, crafts, a, fluent, and, mysterious, introduction, for, “Scrambled, Brain.”, Bisio, employs, double-stops, in, a, wide-ranging, part, while, Taylor-Baker, coaxes, all, manner, of, subtleties, from, the, snare, drum,, evolving, into, a, more, kinetic, posture, and, adding, cymbals, and, toms, as, the, duo, continues., This, is, a, noteworthy, aspect, of, Shipp’s, approach, to, the, trio:, allowing, duo, subsets, of, the, ensemble, to, really, shine, at, various, moments, on, the, recording., Shipp’s, playing,, in, addition, to, having, its, own, original, stamp, showing,, encompasses, the, work, of, a, wide, range, of, progenitors:, Taylor,, Hill,, Monk,, Tyner,, and, Ellington,, just, to, name, a, few., Shipp’s, short, solo, at, the, beginning, of, the, proceedings,, and, his, intro, on, “Silence, of”, combine, modal, and, post-bop, lyricism., He, forcefully, swings, on, “Micro, Wave,”, a, tune, that, moves, from, quasi-bop, licks, to, far, more, dissonant, utterances., “Mind, Space”, finds, him, supplying, fleet-fingered, angular, lines, countered, by, Taylor-Baker,, while, repeated, notes, and, chords, as, well, as, achingly, slow, Schoenbergian, arpeggiations, are, accompanied, by, Bisio’s, arco, playing, on, “Void, of, Sea.”, “The, Nature, Of”, features, Shipp’s, signature, low, register, melodies,, in, which, a, bass, line, is, accompanied, by, a, countermelody, up, an, octave, or, so., Eventually,, the, piece, expands, to, encompass, the, upper, register, too,, with, vertical, stabs, added, to, the, duet, texture., “Gravity, Point”, is, rife, with, repetition,, with, halting, ostinatos, and, tremolos, set, against, a, middle, register, piano, solo, and, furious, interplay, from, the, rhythm, section., The, album, closes, with, the, title, tune,, a, poignant, ballad, that, the, listener, may, imagine, as, Shipp, waving, goodbye, to, this, chapter., Shipp’s,

Pulitzer, prize, winner’s, absolute, command, of, idiomatic, writing, for, strings., Aria-Lament,  (1992), departs, from, an, introduction, filled, with, soft, altissimo, passages, to, a, gradual, buildup, of, energy, in, the, main, section,, incorporating, meaty, double, stops, and, angular, allegro, melodic, lines., A, Dance, of, Life, (2010), juxtaposes, fast, moving, chromatic, passages, with, ruminative, sections, of, achingly, sustained, lines.,  , Cuckson, has, performed, a, great, deal, of, Michael, Hersch’s, music., A, recent, work, composed, specifically, for, her,, the, weather, and, landscape, are, on, our, side, (2016),, demonstrated, the, composer’s, keen, affinity, for, Cuckson’s, capabilities., A, multi-movement, work,, it, features, numerous, delicate, passages,, employing, bowing, techniques,, pizzicato,, and, harmonics, to, differentiate, gestures., All, was, not, introversion, however,, as, the, piece, also, accorded, the, violinist, dynamic, sections, which, burst, forth, in, eruptive, fashion.,  , The, concert, culminated, with, Huang, Ruo’s, Four, Fragments, (2006),, pieces, requiring, considerable, virtuosity, that, use, sliding, tones, and, melodic, patterns, from, traditional, Chinese, music., The, frequent, resemblance, to, vocalisms, from, Chinese, opera, were, striking., The, Fragments, were, a, thrilling, way, to, end, the, concert.,  , Cuckson, is, an, ideal, emissary, for, contemporary, music., Assaying, a, formidable, program,, her, preparation, was, exquisite, and, presentation, consistently, engaging., Miller, has, more, “Pop, Up”, events, in, the, Spring,, including, performances, by, the, Orlando, Consort,, ICE,, Ensemble, Signal,, JACK,, and, Mivos, Quartet., The, price, can’t, be, beat, –, free, –, and, one, can, even, enjoy, a, libation, to, boot., Save, Comments, Off, on, Miranda, at, Miller, Mar, 14, 2017, Misato, Mochizuki, at, Miller, Theatre, (concert, review), Posted, by, Christian, Carey, in,

Tsushima, Misato, Mochizuki, Composer, Portrait, Thursday, March, 2,, 2017, Miller, Theatre, By, Christian, Carey,  , NEW, YORK, –, On, Thursday,, March, 2nd,, Japanese, composer, Misato, Mochizuki, was, featured, on, Miller, Theatre’s, Composer, Portraits, series., In, a, concert, featuring, four, U.S., premieres, and, concluding, with, a, work, commissioned, and, premiered, at, the, 2015, Lincoln, Center, Festival,, the, audience, was, introduced, to, a, range, of, her, work., Throughout,, Mochizuki, demonstrated, a, clear, aesthetic, embodied, by, an, interest, in, exploring, a, panorama, of, instrumental, timbres, and, effects, and, a, flair, for, dramatic,, often, quasi-ceremonial,, designs.,  , The, earliest, work, on, the, program,, Au, Bleu, Bois, (1998), for, solo, oboe,, was, a, standout., Mochizuki, uses, various, playing, techniques, in, an, imaginatively, constructed, trajectory,, ranging, from, microtones, to, multiphonics, through, all, manner, of, alternate, fingerings., James, Austin, Smith, made, this, formidable, work, sound, fluent, and, exquisitely, well-shaped., Moebius-Ring, (2003), was, likewise, given, a, persuasive, rendition, by, Ning, Yu,, who, handled, its, muscular,, seemingly, ceaseless,, repetitions, of, corruscating, glissandos, with, mastery., Percussionist, Russell, Greenberg’s, committed, and, commanding, performance, of, Quark-Intermezzi, III, featured, a, catalog, of, percussion, instruments, and, extended, techniques., Unfortunately,, here, Mochizuki’s, penchant, for, the, reiterative, moved, past, the, merely, confrontational, to, the, assaultive,, populating, the, work, with, fortissimo, thwacks, of, a, tam-tam, over, and, over, again, and, a, flock, of, searing, bowed, crotales, (which, appeared, elsewhere, on, the, program, in, a, similarly, overdosed, measure).,  , JACK, gave, an, excellent, performance, of, Mochizuki’s, first, string, quartet, Terres, Rouges, (2006)., Once, again,, there, was, a, “kitchen, sink”, aspect, to, the, catalogue, of, playing, techniques, featured;, in, general,, editing, could, be, a, friend, to, the, composer., However,, several, of, the, gestures, found, a, structural, place, that, helped, one, sieve, through, the, panoply:, a, strident, high, violin, note, that, opened, the, piece, and, reappeared,, transformed,, at, its, conclusion,, the, exertion, of, varying, degrees, of, bow, pressure,, microtonal, harmonics,, and, hammer, on, techniques, reminiscent, of, the, way, heavy, metal, guitarists, dig, in., Indeed,, one, could, see, the, members, of, JACK, revelling, in, the, challenges, posed, to, them,, acting, as, a, tight, ensemble, unit.,  , The, concert, closed, with, Le, monde, des, rond, et, de, carrés, (2015)., Written, for, Yarn/Wire, and, first, premiered, at, the, 2015, Lincoln, Center, Festival,, it, is, a, piece, just, as, much, about, ritual, and, choreography, as, it, is, about, challenging, chamber, music., Its, beginning, is, particularly, striking., Percussionists, Ian, Antonio, and, Greenberg, made, their, way, from, the, back, of, the, hall, to, the, stage,, playing, crotales, and, cup, bells., Once, onstage,, they, were, joined, by, pianists,  Laura, Barger, and, Ning, Yu, in, unison, passages,, which, gradually, began, to, accumulate, a, more, extensive, pitch, profile, as, the, percussionists, moved, to, mallet, instruments., The, intensity, of, the, glockenspiel, and, vibraphone,, played, in, fiercely, fortissimo, patterns,, urged, the, pianists, to, their, own, glissandos, and, ostinatos., After, the, aforementioned, searing, passages, featuring, bowed, crotales,, a, drumkit, was, added, to, the, proceedings,, first, played, by, Antonio,, then, with, Greenberg, joining, in., The, piece’s, climax, involves, the, kit, exclusively,, with, both, the, pianists, joining, the, percussionists, attacking, the, kit, as, well,, unleashing, a, bombardment, of, crashing, cymbals, and, forceful, drumming., It, was, a, kinetic, and, fascinatingly, choreographic, conclusion, to, the, piece, and, the, concert., Mochizuki, has, found, stalwart, advocates, in, Yarn/Wire, and, JACK;, one, can, imagine, future, fruitful, collaborations, among, them.,  , Comments, Off, on, Misato, Mochizuki, at, Miller, Theatre, (concert, review), «, Previous, Entries, Featured, Release, BRIDGE, 3,
