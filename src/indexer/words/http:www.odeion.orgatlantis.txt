of, Atlantis, Epigraph, �The, men, of, old, possessed, all, knowledge, and, had, no, use, for, it.�, -, Chuang, Tzu, The, Keys, of, Atlantis, Preface, Since, the, 1970s,, man's, measures, of, the, Earth, and, its, Moon, have, achieved, an, almost, incredible, precision., This, has, been, accomplished, solely, through, the, media, of, artificial, satellites, and, radio, telemetry., Such, precise, measurements, simply, cannot, be, made, from, the, surface, of, the, Earth., This, book, examines, ancient, metrological, systems, whose, origins, are, lost, in, the, mists, of, time., In, the, light, of, modern,, space-age,, measurements,, some, ancient, units, of, measure, can, be, seen, to, be, based, on, equally, precise, determinations, of, the, dimensions, of, Earth, and, Moon., Moreover,, they, can, be, seen, to, have, been, designed, to, carry, this, very, message, forward, to, that, epoch, when, technology, would, yield, such, precision, once, again;, our, own, time., Once, the, means, of, conveyance, has, been, solidly, established,, connected, material, is, shown, to, carry, similar, messages, of, prior, knowledge, of, biochemistry, and, atomic, structure., This, book, is, about, those, messages., Since, completing, the, research, for, this, book, and, writing, up, the, first, few, chapters,, I, have, become, acquainted, with, the, work, of, the, late, and, extraordinary, Professor, Livio, Catullo, Stecchini., On, the, subject, of, geodesy,, he, says*, �Some, twenty, years, ago, when, I, arrived, at, establishing, the, data, that, I, have, just, listed, I, considered, them, breathtaking., It, was, only, later, that, I, realized, that, the, ancients, were, aware, of, the, fact, that, the, degrees, of, latitude, become, longer, as, one, approaches, the, poles., I, discovered, that, the, units, used, in, Greece, and, Rome, (and, also, in, Mesopotamia,, except, for, the, very, early, period), were, based, on, the, length, of, the, degree, of, latitude, at, latitude, 37�, 42'N,, latitude, of, Mycenae., Herodotos, refers, to, it, as, the, latitude, of, the, Heraeum, of, Samos, in, comparing, Greek, units, with, the, Egyptian, ones., �In, 1971, I, believed, that, I, was, uttering, a, daring, statement, when, I, published, that, the, Egyptians, had, reached, the, level, of, precision, achieved, by, the, great, geodetic, surveys, conducted, at, the, beginning, of, the, [20th], century., It, was, only, later, that, I, was, forced, to, realize, that, the, Egyptians, had, reached, the, level, of, precision, which, we, have, reached, in, the, last, decade, thanks, to, the, new, techniques, of, space, exploration.�, And, so, I, find, that, I, am, not, the, only, person, to, have, reached, the, selfsame, conclusion., In, view, of, the, fact, that, his, expressed, opinion, appears, to, significantly, predate, my, own,, I, cannot, claim, origination, for, the, observation, even, though, I, arrived, at, it, quite, independently., However,, I, think, it, no, false, claim, that, my, work, complements, and, extends, his, and, thoroughly, vindicates, his, stand, on, the, astronomical, advancement, of, the, ancients, although, I, must, confess, it, is, not, yet, entirely, clear, to, me, how, he, arrived, at, that, conclusion., It, is, my, hope, that, I, can, present, a, fully, supported, case,, leaving, no, one, wondering, how, I, might, have, intuited, or, otherwise, divined, the, claims, I, make., It, should, be, understood, that, no, attempt, to, argue, the, existence, of, the, legendary, Atlantis, is, being, made, here,, the, use, of, the, name, in, the, title, being, purely, poetic., What, is, established, is, that, an, extraordinary, and, previously, unrecognized, intellectual, development, took, place, over, some, unidentified, period, in, mankind's, history, or,, more, likely,, pre-history;, a, development, which, does, not, seem, to, have, a, place, in, the, currently, accepted, catalog, but, which,, however,, has, left, us, a, legacy, which, cannot, be, denied., I, must, leave, it, to, others, to, locate, its, source,, being, content, to, identify, some, small, part, of, the, legacy, itself., Someone,, somewhere,, sometime, put, an, inordinate, amount, of, effort, -, and, computing, power,, presumably, of, the, purely, organic, kind, -, into, creating, this, legacy, and, ensuring, that, it, would, not, be, lost, in, the, hope, that, it, would, eventually, be, recognized, for, what, it, is., As, to, the, tale, of, Atlantis,, some, of, which, is, reproduced, in, Appendix, A,, I, can, only, quote, an, English, proverb, -, �Where, there's, smoke, there's, fire�., Perhaps, indeed, only, beneath, the, murky, waters, of, a, tantalizing, anagram,, about, which, no, more, will, be, said, here., No, matter, whence, it, came, the, legacy, itself, is, nonetheless, very, real., What, the, reader, must, allow, is, that, without, first, having, read, Plato's, Timaeus,, in, the, late, 1960s,, I, would, never, have, written, this, book., Hence, it, is, of, no, real, consequence, whether, or, not, Atlantis, ever, really, existed;, the, tale, of, it, most, certainly, does,, unarguably,, and, that, was, my, inspiration, and, deserving, of, due, credit, for, that, alone, if, naught, else., Unlike, the, tale, of, Eden, that, seems, to, describe, allegorically, the, combined, roles, of, psychoactive, mushrooms, and, feminine, curiosity, in, the, birth, of, self-awareness,, if, not, actual, speciation,, in, the, human, race,, that, of, Atlantis,, whether, real, or, allegorical,, describes, a, post-Eden, pinnacle, and, its, subsequent, disappearance., The, reader, should, not,, however,, think, that, he, is, about, to, enter, yet, another, attempt, to, translate, the, Timaeus, into, even, plainer, English, and, to, extract, some, additional, meaning, from, it, that, has, not, already, been, thoroughly, pored, over, by, generations, of, erudite, scholars., Clearly, neither, Pythagoras, nor, Plato, truly, understood, the, nature, of, sound, and, music., This, is, not, to, diminish, their, genius, in, the, slightest, but, merely, to, identify, the, missing, parts, of, their, worldview., The, present, author, has, the, advantage, of, the, knowledge, accumulated, by, concerted, and, highly, successful, scientific, and, musicological, research, over, the, past, several, hundred, years, and, has, thus, been, able, quite, independently, to, synthesize, the, full, derivation, of, the, musical, intervals, and, thereby, of, the, Babylonian, unit, of, rotation,, the, �degree, of, arc�., The, musical, intervals, are, in, fact, aeonian, and, were, there, sets, of, intelligent, ears, on, some, planet, in, an, unreachably, distant, galaxy, then, they, too, could, discover, dodekaphonic, music, and, could, produce, their, own, Beethoven, and, Mozart., Nonetheless,, once, the, actual, system, is, laid, out,, elements, of, it, can, be, seen, quite, clearly, in, the, pythagorean, model, laid, out, by, Plato., Since, a, defective, model, cannot, be, the, root, and, source, of, the, western, system, of, music, Pythagoras, must, have, been, transmitting, knowledge, which, preceded, him, and,, by, his, time,, reduced, to, fragments, just, as, so, many, written, works, of, the, ancient, Greeks, have, been, lost, to, us, in, the, here, and, now., It, is, a, recognized, fact, that, the, most, brilliant, composing, musician, needs, neither, knowledge, of, acoustics, nor, anyone's, theory, of, harmony, in, order, to, create, and, perform, the, most, wonderful, music., Conversely,, all, the, knowledge, in, the, world, of, those, subjects, will, not, make, a, musician,, let, alone, a, composer,, out, of, anyone., Music, seems, to, be, rather, like, love, in, that, respect., Preceding, statements, notwithstanding,, the, material, under, discussion, must, have, come, from, somewhere, and, that, somewhere, had, to, predate, all, of, the, somewheres, for, which, we, have, historical, data, because, they, all, display, both, fragments, of, it, and, either, false, rationalizations, or, even, complete, unawareness, of, those, fragments,, the, length, of, the, Silk, Road., Whether, or, not, the, original, source, was, Plato's, Atlantis,, the, material, documented, here, stands, on, its, own, merits., Pythagoras, recognized, that, the, duple-ratio, musical, interval,, the, octave,, which, he, called, the, �universal, concord�,, was, at, the, very, heart, of, it, and, yet, he, provided, no, explanation, of, why, that, should, be., Hence, those, who, slavishly, follow, Pythagoras, are, also, unable, to, provide, that, explanation., There, is, indeed, a, physical, reason, for, the, absolute, defining, nature, of, the, octave, and, it, is, spelled, out, in, Chapter, 1., As, far, as, I, am, aware,, the, full, reconstruction, in, Chapter, 1, of, the, complete, derivation, of, the, dodekaphonic, musical, intervals,, leading, to, the, dependent, derivation, of, the, Babylonian, unit, of, rotation, and, the, minute, of, time,, is, entirely, novel, and, original,, as, is, the, content, of, all, the, subsequent, chapters., The, reader, will, occasionally, come, across, the, term, masonic, in, connection, with, names, associated, with, certain, ancient, stone, monuments, and, their, architects, and, builders., This, should, not, be, interpreted, as, any, reference, to, Scottish, Rite, Freemasonry,, its, derivatives, or, its, members,, with, which, neither, this, author, nor, this, work, have,, ever, had,, or, will, ever, have, any, relationship, or, association., The, presence, of, large, quantities, of, numbers, and, calculations, is, unavoidable, as, these, are, the, very, quintessence, of, the, argument., It, is, widely, recognized, that, such, things, guarantee, a, minimal,, if, not, non-existent,, readership., The, author, can, only, hope, that, the, brave, reader, will, be, heartened, by, Professor, H.S.M.Coxeter's, prefatory, comment, in, his, book, Regular, Polytopes, �, �What, one, fool, can, do,, another, fool, can, do�, �, especially, in, view, of, the, fact, that, the, content, of, this, book, is, nowhere, near, as, mathematically, challenging, as, that, of, the, good, professor's., Until, we, get, to, the, last, chapter,, that, is�, *, Livio, C., Stecchini,, Egyptian, Estimates, of, the, Size, and, Shape, of, the, Earth., My, previous, lack, of, awareness, of, the, extent, of, Stecchini's, work, is, explained, by, the, fact, that, most, of, it, has, never, been, published, in, book, form., Its, transcription, for, and, publication, on, the, World, Wide, Web, have, been, proceeding, since, around, 2001., The, Keys, of,
