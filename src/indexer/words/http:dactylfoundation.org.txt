loss, of, Dactyl, Foundation, advisory, board, member, Angus, Fletcher., Epistemological, Poetics:, A, Walk, with, Angus, Fletcher, by, VN, Alexander, In, 1994,, considering, a, course, on, the, “Literature, of, Nature”, at, the, Graduate, Center, of, the, City, University, New, York,, initially, I, thought, it, be, would, too, pastoral, for, my, tastes—in, those, days, I, thought, I, was, interested, in, art, not, nature—and, I, almost, passed, it, up,, but, the, fates, intervened, in, the, form, of, Linda,, the, all-knowing, and, benign, department, secretary,, who, said, to, me,, “It’s, Angus, Fletcher,”, and,, without, waiting, for, my, response,, wrote, my, name, down, on, the, roll. , In, this, propitious, way,, I, was, introduced, to, the, distinguished, Renaissance, scholar,, whose, methods, fitted, perfectly, with, his, subject, and, whose, work, has, been,, ever, since,, a, steady, spring, of, inspiration., In, manner, as, well, as, appearance,, Angus, might, be, described,, with, his, vibrant, white, hair, and, beard,, as, a, classic, sage., He, tends, to, think, aloud, in, class—about, Faust’s, contract, or, the, contrapuntal, voices, of, a, fugue, or, Whitman—and, encourages, students, to, join, in, as, his, wanders, in, his, mental, lake, country., Joan, Richardson, has, called, Angus, Fletcher, “a, magically, gifted, teacher, in, whose, presence, we, hear, what, thinking, feels, like.”, Indeed, the, synesthetic, experience, of, his, poetic, logic, was, always, instructive,, leading, inevitably, to, the, unforeseen, vista., Memories, of, 1994, recall, that, at, some, auspicious, point, in, each, ninety-minute, session,, he, would, suddenly, deliver, an, inspired, oration, that, would, leave, us, all, physically, moved., To, come, upon, such, depth, and, breath, of, erudition, is, to, feel, precisely, what, García, López, de, Cárdenas, must, have, felt, when, he, unexpectedly, came, upon, the, Grand, Canyon., [continue...], Comments,

Lose, (New, Island, Press,, 228, pages), a, book, that, stunned, me,, time, and, again., I, might, call, Billy, O’Callaghan, a, “writer’s, writer,”, if, that, term, did, not, immediately, consign, a, writer, to, obscurity., (In, the, USA,, Richard, Yates, is, often, referred, to, as, a, “writer’s, writer,”, and, until, the, movie Revolutionary, Road,, few, people,, apart, from, those, who, taught, in, MFA, programs,, knew, his, name.), I, would, like, to, invent, a, new, way, to, describe, what, I, think, Billy, O’Callaghan, will, leave, as, his, literary, legacy., I, would, call, him, a, “human’s, human”, (with, a, pen), or, an, “explorer’s, explorer”, of, our, dreams., I, would, call, him, a, poet, of, the, spirit., Or,, maybe,, to, use, a, more, prosaic, analogy,, he, is, a, housekeeper, who, assiduously, dusts, the, cluttered, rooms, we, keep, closed,, even, from, our, conscious, minds. Continue, reading →, The, Tiger’s, Wife, by, Téa Obreht, Posted, on August, 1,, 2016, by U.R., Bowie, Like, many, who, have, read, this, first, novel,, written, by, a, young, woman, still, in, her, twenties,, I, marvel, at, the, very, existence, of, the The, Tiger’s, Wife, (Random, House,, 338, pages)., How, could, someone, this, young, have, written, a, narrative, this, complicated,, this, full, of, insights, into, human, nature,, this, teeming, with, art—this, GOOD?, I, have, read, several, reviews, of, the, book, online, and, I, marvel, once, again, at, the, caviling,, the, failure, to, appreciate, the, book, on, the, part, of, some, reviewers., Have, American, readers, become, so, inured, to, the, genre, of, “domestic, literary, realism,”, this, dull,, insipid, stuff, that, dominates, the, publishing, world, these, days—stories, of, ordinary, Americans, doing, ordinary, things,, told,, for, the, most, part,, in, flat, ordinary, language—that, they, fail, to, appreciate, something, with, genuine, verve, and, brilliance? Continue, reading →, Leo, Tolstoy’s, Anna, Karenina,, translated, by, Miriam Schwartz, Posted, on July, 25,, 2016, by U.R., Bowie, So, here, we, have, one, more, translation, into, English, of Anna, Karenina, (Yale, University, Press,, 754, pages), the, greatest, novel, ever, written, in, the, history, of, world, literature, (my, opinion,, but, not, only, mine)., The, publicity, announcements, and, blurbs, make, big, claims, for, this, book., Marian, Schwartz,, a, renowned, translator, with, extensive, experience,, “embraces, Tolstoy’s, unusual, style—she, is, the, first, English, language, translator, ever, to, do, so.”, Hmm., “Clearly, a, labor, of, love—over, a, decade, in, the, making—this, translation, is, the, most, accurate, Tolstoy, we, have, in, English.”, Hmm., Marian, Schwartz, “bequeaths, us, not, a, translation, at, all, but, Tolstoy’s, English, original.”, Huh?, Such, grandiose, blurbery, places, quite, a, burden, on, the, shoulders, of, the, translated, text., Let’s, see, if, the, text, can, bear, such, a, heavy, weight. Continue, reading →, The, Road, by, Cormac McCarthy, Posted, on July, 20,, 2016, by U.R., Bowie, I’m, ten, years, late, getting, around, to, reading The, Road, (Alfred, A., Knopf,, 287, pages),, but, since, it, has, to, rank, among, the, most, powerful, pieces, of, American, fiction, written, in, the, past, ten, years,, it, remains, more, than, worthy, of, discussion., McCarthy, here, tells, a, tale, of, “nights, dark, beyond, darkness, and, the, days, more, gray, each, one, than, what, had, gone, before.”, We’re, in, the, genre, of, post-apocalyptic, fiction., Bad, times, have, descended, upon, the, U.S., and, the, whole, world,, consequent, upon, some, enormous, Catastrophe., We, are, never, told, what, happened—it, could, have, been, a, nuclear, war—but, one, thing, is, obvious:, something, really, big, has, blown,, leaving, ash, all, over, the, earth, and, floating, through, the, air., Apparently, most, animals, are, extinct,, and, the, few, human, beings, who, survive, face, fellow, humans, who, are,, largely,, living, beastly, lives. Continue, reading →, The, Making, of, Zombie, Wars, by, Aleksandar Hemon, Posted, on July, 17,, 2016, by U.R., Bowie, A, literary, truism:, good, comic, writing,, any, comic, writing, that, professes, to, call, itself, literary, fiction,, must, be, undergirded, with, a, firm, foundation, in, seriousness., Nikolai, Gogol, was/is, the, greatest, comic, writer, in, Russian, literature;, his, works, are, profound., Vladimir, Nabokov, wrote, the, following, about, Gogol’s, long, story,, “The, Overcoat,”, widely, considered, the, best, story, ever, written, in, Russia:, “The, diver,, the, seeker, for, pearls,, the, man, who, prefers, the, monsters, of, the, deep, to, the, sunshades, on, the, beach,, will, find, in, ‘The, Overcoat’, shadows, linking, our, state, of, existence, to, those, other, states, and, modes, which, we, dimly, apprehend, in, our, rare, moments, of, irrational, perception.”, Too, many, contemporary, American, writers, of, literary, fiction, are, under, those, umbrellas, on, the, beach., If, they, are, swimming, at, all, they, are, swimming, in, the, shallows., There, are, depths, to, be, plumbed, through, the, art, of, writing, creative, fiction., Why, not, plumb, them?, Is, it, too, risky?, Is, it, easier, to, wade, into, tepid, waters, and, potter, around, there?, Time, to, take, a, deep, breath, and, dive, down, deep, now,, modern, American, author., Time, to, stop, your, “shit-swimming”, (Hemon’s, term,, taken, out, of, context), in, the, literary, shallows., The, Making, of, Zombie, Wars, (Farrar,, Straus, and, Giroux,, 307, pages), begins, with, Hollywood, silliness—amateur, screenwriters, pitching, ideas, to, one, another, in, a, Chicago, workshop—the, idiocy, and, mindlessness, of, Hollywood, (and, of, the, whole, U.S., A.),, lurks, in, the, background, all, the, way, through, to, the, end., Practically, all, of, Hemon’s, books, with, American, characters, in, a, U.S., setting, present, a, picture, of, our, country, teeming, with, idiots., This, novel, is, set, in, 2003,, just, as, we, were, embarking, on, what, will, surely, go, down, as, one, of, the, most, idiotic, foreign-policy, decisions, of, the, twenty-first, century:, the, invasion, of, Iraq. Continue, reading →, Comments, are, closed, Latest, Reviews,

the, way, the, author, then, handled, time,, space,, and, imagination., To, come, to, grips, with, it,, I, had, to, invent, a, literary, term—lyrical, surrealism—to, distinguish, Must’s, work, from,

such, cohesive, and, penetrating, storytelling,, is, a, testament, to, the, author’s, insightful, eye, for, detail, and, character.”, We, can, say, that Sea, of, Hooks , is, a, long, narrative, prose,

(except, other, atheists), believes, they, exist,, certainly, not, in, the, foxhole, of, impending, death., This, is, why, deathbed, conversions, are, expected,, even, in, the, most, “literary”, of, end-of-life, novels,, despite, the, fact, that, one, of, the, accepted, roles, of, a, literary, fiction, author, is, to, question, how, we, make, sense, of, our, lives., If, most, novels, have, the, same, after-life-affirming, answer,, I, wonder, if, these, novelists, are, really, asking, themselves, the, question,, or, merely, posing, it, rhetorically, for, the, sake, of, a, denouement., Every, deathbed, conversion,, it, seems, to, me,, is, another, failure, to, actually, question, the, meaning, of, life., Snowden’s, courageous, refusal, to, backslide, into, belief, for, the, sake, of, an, emotionally, “satisfying”, ending, makes, him, a, strong, contender, for, this, year’s, Dactyl, Foundation, Award, for, Literary, Fiction, (nominated, by, Paul, Xylinides,, see,  review)., If, the,

dying, of, cancer, in, the, dead, of, a, Great, Lake, winter., Defending, his, individuality,, Hal, largely, resents, others, who, try, to, console, him, with, their, own, death, stories:, how, accurate, was, it, for, them, to, mix, their, “pain, with, Hal’s,, as, if, they, and, the, rest, of, humanity, were, manufacturing, some, sort, of, agony, hash?, Surely, every, death, had, its, own,,

dive, under,, this, journey, is, unforgettable., Sea, of, Hooks, is,, on, the, one, hand,, a, fiercely, original, Bildungsroman, set, in, San, Francisco, in, the, 50’s, and, 60’s., Christopher, is, an, overly, imaginative, boy,, part, Holden, Caulfield, and, part, Little, Lame, Prince,, who, lives, in, precarious, affluence, in, a, darkish, Victorian, on, the, edge, of, Pacific, Heights., His,

contentious,, mother-daughter, relationship, is, apparent, from, the, start, in, the, underlying, current, of, criticism, that, Rose, levels, at, her, daughter:, “Course, you, couldn’t, find, it, right, away…You, should, have, used, the, sense, God, gave, you, and, asked, your, brother…Why, you, always, insist, on, making, things, hard, for, yourself, I’ll, never, know;, but, it’s, just, like, you, to, take, a, simple, errand, and, turn, it, into, a, full-blown, crusader, pilgrimage.”, Stephanie,, the, youngest, daughter, of, Rose’s, ten, children,, has, returned, home, after, decades, of,

(St, Martin’s,, 496, pages), is, that, kind, of, book., Cursed, with, what, is, arguable, the, worst, title, ever, given, a, novel, (, and, double-cursed, with, a, depressingly, ugly, dust, jacket),, it, had, press, releases, that, touted, it, with, superlatives, that, would, make, Gore, Vidal, blush., It’s, in, the, fist, person, and, has, one, of, those, woesome, post-adolescent, narrators., Worse,, it’s, a, first, novel, by, a, guy, named, Wilton, who, is, at, Oxford, working, on, a, doctoral, thesis, about, Henry, James., Eventually, I, opened, it, and, started, reading, with, a, promise, to, break, off, after, the, first, chapter, (or, 10, minutes), and, go, mow, the, lawn., When, I, reached, Page, 75, I, realized, that, I, hadn’t, been, counting, either, chapters, or, time,

Christians, are, wont, to, overlook, the, obvious, horror, and, absurdity, of, the, Biblical, tale., According, to, some, (less, awful), Jewish, interpretations, of, events,, it, was, perhaps, Satan,, as, an, agent, of, God,, who, spoke, to, Abraham,, which, would, make, more, sense, to, those, who, imagine, God, to, be, not, quite, so, sadistic. , Either, way, though,, what, kind, of, man, would, this, traumatized, son, become? , In, Isaac:, A, Modern, Fable, (Permanent,, 223, pages),, Ivan, G., Goldman, has, arranged, it, so, that, Isaac,, after, the, mishap, at, the, altar,, has, been,

his, immortality, and, eternal, youth, often, seem, to, him, like, a, curse., Goldman’s, Isaac, has, spent, a, couple, thousand, years, bouncing, around, from, identity, to, identity,, never,

the, mountains, of, twentieth, century, Appalachian, Pennsylvania., It’s, a, hard, book, to, describe, though, an, easy,, and, compelling,, read., NPR, luminary, and, poet, Andrei, Codrescu,
