him, or, herself., There, are, two, types, of, Black, Sheep., The, first, will, make, it, appear, that, they, have, someone, accompanying, them., They, will, place, an, article, of, clothing, or, purchased, item(s), from, the, concession, stand, to, make, it, appear, the, someone, simply, left, to, use, the, restroom, or, get, some, fresh, air., They, will, look, about, as, if, anticipating, the, arrival, of, their, friend,, but, no, one, arrives., The, other, type, is, someone, who, is, alone,, and, doesn’t, care., They, will, sit, proudly, in, their, chair, awaiting, the, film., Maybe,

Shoebox, This, is, a, theater, where, the, length, is, much, greater, then, the, width, causing, a, sense, of, narrowness, to, the, surroundings., A, characteristic, of, this, kind, of, theater, is, that, it, has, only, one, aisle, going, straight, down, the, middle., A, rarity, these, days, except, in, older, theaters,, I, suggest, staying, away, from, these, places, for, the, eerie, fact, that, there, is, no, middle, seat., Funeral, Clown, Just, as, inappropriate, as, a, clown, at, funeral,, this, term, refers, to, any, consumable, goods, emitting, an, odor, not, normally, associated, with, standard, movie, theater, aromas., For, example,, a, hotdog, with, everything, on, it, is, not, normal., You, may, think, it, is,, but, it, is, NOT., The, movie, aromas, allowed, and, not, allowed, are, as, follows:, The, Good:, butter,, popcorn,, soda,, chocolate, and, other, sweets, (NOT, licorice), Neutral:, pretzels, and, nachos, The, Bad:, hot, dogs,, pizza,, chicken,, burritos,, and, fast, food, in, general, The, Hungry, Hippo, This, is, a, person, who, is, in, a, constant, eating, or, drinking, motion, through, the, entire, film., Just, like, the, game, Hungry, Hungry, Hippos,, this, person, gobbles, up, everything, in, sight, not, thinking, about, others, around, him., The, Interpreter, This, is, the, person, who, explains, what, is, unfolding, on, screen, to, either, a, companion, or, to, the, audience., This, is, one, of, the, most, annoying, theater, occupants,, and, the, most, you, can, do, is, ignore, them., It, is, best, not, to, let, them, have, the, satisfaction, of, seeing, you, leave,, because, if, you, do, they, would, have, succeeded, in, annoying, you., Repeter, Peter/Duplicate, Kate, This, is, a, person, who, feels, the, need, to, repeat, dialogue, just, spoken, by, an, actor., They, believe, that, none, of, us, have, hearing, even, though, we, came, to, a, movie,, so, they, decide, they, will, help, us, hear, it, whether, we, want, it, or, not., This, person, is, horrible, in, comedic, films, because, they, will, laugh, after, anything, that’s, meant, to, be, funny., The, Shuffler, This, is, a, person, who, is, unable, to, sit, still, in, their, seat, and, is, constantly, moving., A, good, sign, of, a, shuffler, is, the, constant, sound, of, fabric, rubbing, or, seat, kicking., This, is, one, of, the, most, common, occurrences, in, a, theater, and, cannot, be, prevented, or, extinguished, when, started., Mary, Poppins, Just, like, the, magical, lady, in, the, popular, Disney, movie,, this, person, appears, to, be, revealing, new, foods, and, drinks, as, if, from, nowhere., You, look, down, hoping, to, catch, a, glimpse, of, the, contents, of, what’s, under, their, seat,, but, whatever, is, there, you, never, see, it., Grand, Canyon, This, a, situation, where, the, seat, cushion, is, obviously, too, far, from, the, backrest, (where, you, put, your, back)., A, very, rare, instance, indeed., When, you, sit, down, part, of, your, buttocks, feels, like, it’s, falling, through., In, situations, such, as, this, you, need, to, examine, the, seats, around, you., Most, likely, you, will, be, in, a, group, and, not, by, yourself, (see, The, Black, Sheep), so, you, need, to, find, seats, that, accommodate, your, entire, party., If, this, is, impossible, I, am, afraid, you, must, split, up, your, group,, exchange, your, tickets, for, a, later, showing,, or, deal, with, the, Grand, Canyon., The, Germ, This, person, seems, fine,, until, the, lights, go, down., All, of, a, sudden,, you, here,

invaders., The, Rocking, Chair, When, many, of, us, think, of, the, rocking, chair,, we, immediately, hear, that, annoying, creaking, sound., There, is, always, one, of, these, chairs, in, the, theater,, and, you, could, be, unlucky, enough, to, stumble, upon, it., Most, of, the, time,, you, find, out, the, fact, that, it, squeaks, too, late,, and, there, is, nothing, you, can, do, but, stay, perfectly, still., This, can, be, very, embarrassing,, because, the, moment, it, squeaks, it, sounds, 10, times, louder, then, it, really, is., The, Unwanted, Masseuse, This, person, is, the, absolute, most, common, thing, in, every, theater, in, the, world., They, are, ageless,, and, always, seem, to, find, the, back, of, your, seat, with, their, foot., To, stop, this, you, can, do, the, Traffic, Check,, the, Loud, Whisper,, or, the, Direct, Command., The, Traffic, Check, The, motion, of, looking, to, your, left, and, right, but, not, behind, you,, to, signal, the, Unwanted, Masseuse, to, cease, and, desist., Do, this, enough, times, as, to, get, there, attention;, don’t, try, to, hide, it., The, Loud, Whisper, This, is, a, common, term, known, to, many., It’s, the, act, of, simply, speaking, aloud, to, a, friend, or, even, to, no, one, and, saying, “someone, is, kicking, my, seat.”, You, do, this, at, a, loud, enough, volume, as, so, the, Unwanted, Masseuse, will, hear, and, stop., The, Direct, Command, This, is, a, last, resort, when, dealing, with, a, Unwanted, Masseuse, when, the, Traffic, Check, and, the, Loud, Whisper, fail., Some, will, not, even, take, this, step,, because, it, is, very, scary, to, attempt., It, is, simply, turning, around, and, saying, in, a, loud, and, audible, voice, “Will, you, please, STOP, KICKING, MY, SEAT!”, This, is, the, most, effective, of, all, steps, when, used, correctly., However,, there, is, a, small, chance, of, backfire., If, you, do, it, incorrectly, or, if, the, person, is, enough, of, a, shmuck,, he, will, kick, your, seat, even, harder., This, is, where, the, 18, year, old, pimple, faced, manager, needs, to, get, involved., The, Ghost(s), At, the, beginning, of, a, film,, a, person, or, a, group, of, people, might, sit, in, front, of, you, or, by, your, side., During, the, movie, you, look, over, and, suddenly, the, people, are, gone., These, are, ghosts,, and, believe, it, or, not, are, regular, haunts, at, many, movie, theaters., The, Dump, This, is, the, area, in, the, theater, where, you, put, your, feet,, concession, stand, items,, and, maybe, articles, of, clothing., A, common, characteristic, of, The, Dump, is, a, sticky, adhesive, layer, that, causes, a, smacking, sound, when, walked, upon., This, sticky, layer, is, normally, composed, of, spilled, soda,, bubblegum,, gummy, candies,, and, anything, that, has, been, transferred, from, a, seat, occupants, shoes., Make, sure, that, when, choosing, your, seat, you, try, to, find, one, without, this, disgusting, nuisance., The, General, This, person, is, very, easy, to, find, because, they, will, be, roaming, the, theater, in, a, security, uniform, trying, to, look, busy., These, people, are, commonly, drunk, with, power,, and, use, it, to, prevent, paying, theater, customers, from, Movie, Hopping, and, to, expel, children, under, 17, from, rated, R, movies., They, believe, they, are, the, highest, ranking, official, in, the, theater, system, and, will, gladly, tell, you, so., Movie, Hopping, This, term, refers, to, the, act, of, paying, for, one, movie,, but, “hopping”, to, different, movies, over, the, course, of, the,

plagues, many, moviegoers, and, is, unfortunately, without, a, cure., The, cause, of, this, illness, is, the, popcorn, butter, available, at, the, concession, stand., Symptoms, of, the, disease, are, nausea,, clammy, hands,, migraine,, fatigue,, and, a, stomach, ache., Even, though, many, people, are, constantly, sick, with, MTS,, they, continue, to, get, popcorn, butter., Ingredients, of,

movie, after, it, has, already, started., You, must, allow, a, window, of, at, least, 5, minutes, after, the, movie, begins, before, you, can, call, someone, a, White, Rabbit., These, people, can, cause, a, disturbance, as, their, trying, to, find, a, seat, because, they, usually, go, for, the, one, empty, middle, seat, or, they, decide, they, need, to, walk, directly, in, front, of, the, screen., The, Vagrant, This, is, a, person, who, has, a, disheveled, look, about, him/her,, and, instantly, you, wonder, if, their, homeless., Most, of, the, time, you, are, probably, incorrect,, and,

jargon., Basically,, it’s, a, person, who, you, see, reading, a, book, before, the, movie, begins., This, person, is, almost, always, by, themselves,, and, therefore, would, also, be, a, Black, Sheep., The, Bookworm, isn’t, really, frowned, upon, because, they, sit, quietly, and, usually, don’t, disturb, anyone., The, Velvet, Rope, You, can, use, this, word, to, describe, either, a, person,, or, the, action, they, are, taking., For, example,, "that, person, is, a, velvet, rope,", or, "that, person, is, using, the, velvet, rope, maneuver.", The, Velvet, Rope, is, when, you, are, saving, seats, for, others, and, you, are, preventing, others, from, trying, to, steal, them., The, Velvet, Rope, technique, or, the, Velvet, Roper, is, normally, not, troublesome,, but, there, are, times,
