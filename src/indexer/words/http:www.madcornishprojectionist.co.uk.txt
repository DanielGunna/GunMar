23rd,, 2016., Last, updated, on, January, 31st,, 2017., Welcome,  , Hello, and, welcome, to, my, website., This, site, has, been, in, existence, in, one, form, or, another, since, 1997, and, originally, aimed, to, look, at the, world, of, the, Projectionist,, the, Projector, and, the, cinema, industry, as, a, whole., Over, the, years, it, has, grown, and, expanded, but, its, aim, is, to, provide, information, about, this, part, of, the, entertainment, industry.,  , Today, as, technology, and, cinema, has, changed, there, is, additional, information, on, other, areas, of, projection,, whether, it, is, in, a, non-traditional, local, venue,, projection, mapping,, 360, degree, or, any, other, environment, where, a, projected, image, is, used, to, tell, a, story.,  , The, site, continues, to, aim, to, look, at, everything, from, the, earliest, cinema, technology, through, to, whatever, the, future, has, to, hold,, and, everything, in, between., By, far, the, largest, part, of, this, site, is, now, as, a, news, resource, providing, curated, information, on, the, technical, and, business, side, of, cinema,, but, also, with, longer, ‘blog’, articles, – if, you, want, to,

on, October, 20th,, 2015., Last, updated, on, October, 20th,, 2015., The, Projection, Project, –, tell, your, story, The, Projection, Project, is, a, research, project, funded, by, the, Arts, and, Humanities, Research, Council, which, investigates, cinematic, projection., It, documents, the, projectionist’s, role, as, it, passes, into, history,, following, the, switch, of, most, cinemas, to, digital, projection, between, 2010, and, 2012., It, also, looks, at, the, contemporary, expansion, of, projected, images, outside, of, the, cinema., Running, from, October, 2014, to, January, 2018,, the, project, will, use, interviews, with, projectionists,, archive, research,, feature, films, and, photographs, to, explore, historical, projection, and, the, digital, transformations, of, the, twenty-first, century., The, contemporary, transitions, in, projection, are, the, latest, in, a, series, of, transformations, through, which, the, history, of, cinema, itself, can, be, traced., We, will, learn, from, projectionists, themselves, about, what, the, job, entails,, and, look, at, trade, papers, and, trade, union, records, to, chart, significant, alterations, in, exhibition, practice,, the, projectionists’, views, of, cinema, and, the, aesthetics, of, the, ‘good, performance’., This, combination, of, methods, will, allow, us, to, contribute, to, the, understanding, and, history, of, cinema, as, both, industry, and, artform.,  , And, I, am, pleased, to, be, part, of, the, Advisory, Board, for, this, fantastic, project.,  , For, more, details, and, to, take, part,,
