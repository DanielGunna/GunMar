influenced, by, culture, in, society, and, which, in, turn, helps, to, change, culture., As, such,, the, arts, are, a, physical, manifestation, of, people's, internal, creative, impulse., Major, constituents, of, the, arts, include, literature, –, including, poetry,, novels, and, short, stories,, and, epic, poetry;, performing, arts, –, among, them, music,, dance,, and, theatre;, culinary,

sentient, being, through, or, on, an, accessible, medium, so, that, anyone, can, view,, hear, or, experience, it., The, act, itself, of, producing, an, expression, can, also, be, referred, to, as, a, certain, art,, or, as, art, in, general., If, this, solidified, expression,, or, the, act, of, producing, it,, is, "good", or, has, value, depends, on, those, who, access, and, rate, it, and, this, public, rating, is, dependent, on, various, subjective, factors., Merriam-Webster, defines, "the, arts", as, "painting,, sculpture,, music,, theater,, literature,, etc.,, considered, as, a, group, of, activities, done, by, people, with, skill, and, imagination."[2], Similarly,, the, United, States, Congress,, in, the, National, Foundation, on, the, Arts, and, Humanities, Act,, defined, "the, arts", as, follows:[3], The, term, 'the, arts', includes,, but, is, not, limited, to,, music, (instrumental, and, vocal),, dance,, drama,, folk, art,, creative, writing,, architecture, and, allied, fields,, painting,, sculpture,, photography,, graphic, and, craft, arts,, industrial, design,, costume, and, fashion, design,, motion, pictures,, television,, radio,, film,, video,, tape, and, sound, recording,, the, arts, related, to, the, presentation,, performance,, execution,, and, exhibition, of, such, major, art, forms,, all, those, traditional, arts, practiced, by, the, diverse, peoples, of, this, country., (sic), and, the, study, and, application, of, the, arts, to, the, human, environment., History[edit], Main, article:, History, of, art, In, Ancient, Greece,, all, art, and, craft, was, referred, to, by, the, same, word,, Techne., Thus,, there, was, no, distinction, between, the, arts., Ancient, Greek, art, brought, the, veneration, of, the, animal, form, and, the, development, of, equivalent, skills, to, show, musculature,, poise,, beauty,, and, anatomically, correct, proportions., Ancient, Roman, art, depicted, gods, as, idealized, humans,, shown, with, characteristic, distinguishing, features, (i.e., Zeus', thunderbolt)., In, Byzantine, and, Gothic, art, of, the, Middle, Ages,, the, dominance, of, the, church, insisted, on, the, expression, of, biblical, and, not, material, truths., Eastern, art, has, generally, worked, in, a, style, akin, to, Western, medieval, art,, namely, a, concentration, on, surface, patterning, and, local, colour, (meaning, the, plain, colour, of, an, object,, such, as, basic, red, for, a, red, robe,, rather, than, the, modulations, of, that, colour, brought, about, by, light,, shade, and, reflection)., A, characteristic, of, this, style, is, that, the, local, colour, is, often, defined, by, an, outline, (a, contemporary, equivalent, is, the, cartoon)., This, is, evident, in,, for, example,, the, art, of, India,, Tibet, and, Japan., Religious, Islamic, art, forbids, iconography,, and, expresses, religious, ideas, through, geometry, instead., Disciplines[edit], Lawrence, Alma-Tadema's, Catullus-at-Lesbia's, (1865), In, the, Middle, Ages,, the, Artes, Liberales, (liberal, arts), were, taught, in, universities, as, part, of, the, Trivium,, an, introductory, curriculum, involving, grammar,, rhetoric,, and, logic,[4], and, of, the, Quadrivium,, a, curriculum, involving, the, "mathematical, arts", of, arithmetic,, geometry,, music,, and, astronomy.[5], The, Artes, Mechanicae, (consisting, of, vestiaria, –, tailoring, and, weaving;, agricultura, –, agriculture;, architectura, –, architecture, and, masonry;, militia, and, venatoria, –, warfare,, hunting,, military, education,, and, the, martial, arts;, mercatura, –, trade;, coquinaria, –, cooking;, and, metallaria, –, blacksmithing, and, metallurgy)[6], were, practised, and, developed, in, guild, environments., The, modern, distinction, between, "artistic", and, "non-artistic", skills, did, not, develop, until, the, Renaissance., In, modern, academia,, the, arts, are, usually, grouped, with, or, as, a, subset, of, the, humanities., Some, subjects, in, the, humanities, are, history,, linguistics,, literature,, theology,, philosophy,, and/or, logic., The, arts, have, also, been, classified, as, seven:, Literature,, painting,, sculpture,, and, music, comprise, the, main, four, arts,, of, which, the, other, three, are, derivative;, drama, is, literature, with, acting,, dance, is, music, expressed, through, motion,, and, song, is, music, with, literature, and, voice.[7], Visual, arts[edit], Main, articles:, Visual, art, and, Fine, art, Further, information:, Plastic, arts, and, Work, of, art, Drawing[edit], Main, article:, Drawing, Drawing, is, a, means, of, making, an, image,, using, any, of, a, wide, variety, of, tools, and, techniques., It, generally, involves, making, marks, on, a, surface, by, applying, pressure, from, a, tool,, or, moving, a, tool, across, a, surface., Common, tools, are, graphite, pencils,, pen, and, ink,, inked, brushes,, wax, colour, pencils,, crayons,, charcoals,, pastels,, and, markers., Digital, tools, which, can, simulate, the, effects, of, these, are, also, used., The, main, techniques, used, in, drawing, are, line, drawing,, hatching,, crosshatching,, random, hatching,, scribbling,, stippling,, and, blending., An, artist, who, excels, in, drawing, is, referred, to, as, a, drafter,, draftswoman,, or, draughtsman.[8], Drawing, can, be, used, to, create, art, used, in, cultural, industries, such, as, illustrations,, comics,, and, animation., Painting[edit], Main, article:, Painting, The, Mona, Lisa, is, one, of, the, most, recognizable, artistic, paintings, in, the, Western, world, Painting,, taken, literally,, is, the, practice, of, applying, pigment, suspended, in, a, vehicle, (or, medium), and, a, binding, agent, (a, glue), to, a, surface, (support), such, as, paper,, canvas,, wood, panel, or, a, wall., However,, when, used, in, an, artistic, sense,, it, means, the, use, of, this, activity, in, combination, with, drawing,, composition, and, other, aesthetic, considerations, in, order, to, manifest, the, expressive, and, conceptual, intention, of, the, practitioner., Painting, is, also, used, to, express, spiritual, motifs, and, ideas;, sites, of, this, kind, of, painting, range, from, artwork, depicting, mythological, figures, on, pottery, to, The, Sistine, Chapel, to, the, human, body, itself., Colour, is, the, essence, of, painting, as, sound, is, of, music., Colour, is, highly, subjective,, but, has, observable, psychological, effects,, although, these, can, differ, from, one, culture, to, the, next., Black, is, associated, with, mourning, in, the, West,, but, elsewhere, white, may, be., Some, painters,, theoreticians,, writers, and, scientists,, including, Goethe,[9], Kandinsky,[10], and, Newton,[11], have, written, their, own, colour, theory., Moreover,, the, use, of, language, is, only, an, abstraction, for, a, colour, equivalent., The, word, "red,", for, example,, can, cover, a, wide, range, of, variations, on, the, pure, red, of, the, spectrum., There, is, not, a, formalized, register, of, different, colours, in, the, way, that, there, is, agreement, on, different, notes, in, music,, such, as, C, or, C#,, although, the, Pantone, system, is, widely, used, in, the, printing, and, design, industry, for, this, purpose., Modern, artists, have, extended, the, practice, of, painting, considerably, to, include,, for, example,, collage., This, began, with, Cubism,, and, is, not, painting, in, the, strict, sense., Some, modern, painters, incorporate, different, materials, such, as, sand,, cement,, straw,, wood, or, strands, of, hair, for, their, texture., Examples, of, this, are, the, works, of, Elito, Circa,, Jean, Dubuffet, or, Anselm, Kiefer., Modern, and, contemporary, art, has, moved, away, from, the, historic, value, of, craft, in, favour, of, concept;, this, has, led, some, to, say, that, painting,, as, a, serious, art, form,, is, dead,, although, this, has, not, deterred, the, majority, of, artists, from, continuing, to, practise, it, either, as, whole, or, part, of, their, work., Indigenouism, is, also, considered, as, Modern, and, contemporary, Art, in, early, 20th, Century., Ceramics[edit], Main, article:, Ceramic, art, Ceramic, art, is, art, made, from, ceramic, materials, (including, clay),, which, may, take, forms, such, as, pottery,, tile,, figurines,, sculpture,, and, tableware., While, some, ceramic, products, are, considered, fine, art,, some, are, considered, to, be, decorative,, industrial,, or, applied, art, objects., Ceramics, may, also, be, considered, artefacts, in, archaeology.Ceramic, art, can, be, made, by, one, person, or, by, a, group, of, people., In, a, pottery, or, ceramic, factory,, a, group, of, people, design,, manufacture,, and, decorate, the, pottery., Products, from, a, pottery, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, "art, pottery.", In, a, one-person, pottery, studio,, ceramists, or, potters, produce, studio, pottery., In, modern, ceramic, engineering, usage,, "ceramics", is, the, art, and, science, of, making, objects, from, inorganic,, non-metallic, materials, by, the, action, of, heat., It, excludes, glass, and, mosaic, made, from, glass, tesserae., Photography[edit], Main, article:, Fine, art, photography, Photography, as, an, art, form, refers, to, photographs, that, are, created, in, accordance, with, the, creative, vision, of, the, photographer., Art, photography, stands, in, contrast, to, photojournalism,, which, provides, a, visual, account, for, news, events,, and, commercial, photography,, the, primary, focus, of, which, is, to, advertise, products, or, services., Architecture[edit], Main, article:, Architecture, The, Parthenon, on, top, of, the, Acropolis,, Athens,, Greece, Architecture, is, the, art, and, science, of, designing, buildings, and, structures., The, word, architecture, comes, from, the, Greek, arkhitekton,, "master, builder,, director, of, works,", from, αρχι-, (arkhi), "chief", +, τεκτων, (tekton), "builder,, carpenter".[12], A, wider, definition, would, include, the, design, of, the, built, environment,, from, the, macrolevel, of, town, planning,, urban, design,, and, landscape, architecture, to, the, microlevel, of, creating, furniture., Architectural, design, usually, must, address, both, feasibility, and, cost, for, the, builder,, as, well, as, function, and, aesthetics, for, the, user., Table, of, architecture,, Cyclopaedia,, 1728, In, modern, usage,, architecture, is, the, art, and, discipline, of, creating,, or, inferring, an, implied, or, apparent, plan, of,, a, complex, object, or, system., The, term, can, be, used, to, connote, the, implied, architecture, of, abstract, things, such, as, music, or, mathematics,, the, apparent, architecture, of, natural, things,, such, as, geological, formations, or, the, structure, of, biological, cells,, or, explicitly, planned, architectures, of, human-made, things, such, as, software,, computers,, enterprises,, and, databases,, in, addition, to, buildings., In, every, usage,, an, architecture, may, be, seen, as, a, subjective, mapping, from, a, human, perspective, (that, of, the, user, in, the, case, of, abstract, or, physical, artefacts), to, the, elements, or, components, of, some, kind, of, structure, or, system,, which, preserves, the, relationships, among, the, elements, or, components.Planned, architecture, manipulates, space,, volume,, texture,, light,, shadow,, or, abstract, elements, in, order, to, achieve, pleasing, aesthetics., This, distinguishes, it, from, applied, science, or, engineering,, which, usually, concentrate, more, on, the, functional, and, feasibility, aspects, of, the, design, of, constructions, or, structures., In, the, field, of, building, architecture,, the, skills, demanded, of, an, architect, range, from, the, more, complex,, such, as, for, a, hospital, or, a, stadium,, to, the, apparently, simpler,, such, as, planning, residential, houses., Many, architectural, works, may, be, seen, also, as, cultural, and, political, symbols,, and/or, works, of, art., The, role, of, the, architect,, though, changing,, has, been, central, to, the, successful, (and, sometimes, less, than, successful), design, and, implementation, of, pleasingly, built, environments, in, which, people, live., Sculpture[edit], Main, article:, Sculpture, Sculpture, is, the, branch, of, the, visual, arts, that, operates, in, three, dimensions., It, is, one, of, the, plastic, arts., Durable, sculptural, processes, originally, used, carving, (the, removal, of, material), and, modelling, (the, addition, of, material,, as, clay),, in, stone,, metal,, ceramics,, wood, and, other, materials;, but, since, modernism,, shifts, in, sculptural, process, led, to, an, almost, complete, freedom, of, materials, and, process., A, wide, variety, of, materials, may, be, worked, by, removal, such, as, carving,, assembled, by, welding, or, modelling,, or, moulded,, or, cast., Conceptual, art[edit], Main, article:, Conceptual, art, Conceptual, art, is, art, in, which, the, concept(s), or, idea(s), involved, in, the, work, takes, precedence, over, traditional, aesthetic, and, material, concerns., The, inception, of, the, term, in, the, 1960s, referred, to, a, strict, and, focused, practice, of, idea-based, art, that, often, defied, traditional, visual, criteria, associated, with, the, visual, arts, in, its, presentation, as, text.[13], Through, its, association, with, the, Young, British, Artists, and, the, Turner, Prize, during, the, 1990s,[citation, needed], its, popular, usage,, particularly, in, the, UK,, developed, as, a, synonym, for, all, contemporary, art, that, does, not, practise, the, traditional, skills, of, painting, and, sculpture., Literary, arts[edit], Main, articles:, Language, and, Literature, Literature, is, literally, "acquaintance, with, letters", as, in, the, first, sense, given, in, the, Oxford, English, Dictionary., The, noun, "literature", comes, from, the, Latin, word, littera, meaning, "an, individual, written, character, (letter).", The, term, has, generally, come, to, identify, a, collection, of, writings,, which, in, Western, culture, are, mainly, prose, (both, fiction, and, non-fiction),, drama, and, poetry., In, much,, if, not, all, of, the, world,, the, artistic, linguistic, expression, can, be, oral, as, well,, and, include, such, genres, as, epic,, legend,, myth,, ballad,, other, forms, of, oral, poetry,, and, as, folktale., Comics,, the, combination, of, drawings, or, other, visual, arts, with, narrating, literature,, are, often, called, the, "ninth, art", (le, neuvième, art), in, Francophone, scholarship.[14], Performing, arts[edit], Main, article:, Performing, arts, Performing, arts, comprise, dance,, music,, theatre,, opera,, mime,, and, other, art, forms, in, which, a, human, performance, is, the, principal, product., Performing, arts, are, distinguished, by, this, performance, element, in, contrast, with, disciplines, such, as, visual, and, literary, arts, where, the, product, is, an, object, that, does, not, require, a, performance, to, be, observed, and, experienced., Each, discipline, in, the, performing, arts, is, temporal, in, nature,, meaning, the, product, is, performed, over, a, period, of, time., Products, are, broadly, categorized, as, being, either, repeatable, (for, example,, by, script, or, score), or, improvised, for, each, performance.[15], Artists, who, participate, in, these, arts, in, front, of, an, audience, are, called, performers,, including, actors,, magicians,, comedians,, dancers,, musicians,, and, singers., Performing, arts, are, also, supported, by, the, services, of, other, artists, or, essential, workers,, such, as, songwriting, and, stagecraft., Performers, often, adapt, their, appearance, with, tools, such, as, costume, and, stage, makeup., Music[edit], Main, article:, Music, A, musical, score, by, Mozart.,  Play (help·info), Music, is, an, art, form, whose, medium, is, sound, and, silence,, occurring, in, time., Common, elements, of, music, are, pitch, (which, governs, melody, and, harmony),, rhythm, (and, its, associated, concepts, tempo,, metre,, and, articulation),, dynamics,, and, the, sonic, qualities, of, timbre, and, texture., The, creation,, performance,, significance,, and, even, the, definition, of, music, vary, according, to, culture, and, social, context., Music, ranges, from, strictly, organized, compositions, (and, their, reproduction, in, performance), through, improvisational, music, to, aleatoric, pieces., Music, can, be, divided, into, genres, and, subgenres,, although, the, dividing, lines, and, relationships, between, music, genres, are, often, subtle,, sometimes, open, to, individual, interpretation,, and, occasionally, controversial., Within, "the, arts,", music, may, be, classified, as, a, performing, art,, a, fine, art,, and, auditory, art., Theatre[edit], Main, article:, Theatre, Theatre, or, theater, (from, Greek, theatron, (θέατρον);, from, theasthai,, "behold")[16], is, the, branch, of, the, performing, arts, concerned, with, acting, out, stories, in, front, of, an, audience, using, combinations, of, speech,, gesture,, music,, dance,, sound, and, spectacle, –, indeed,, any, one, or, more, elements, of, the, other, performing, arts., In, addition, to, the, standard, narrative, dialogue, style,, theatre, takes, such, forms, as, opera,, ballet,, mime,, kabuki,, classical, Indian, dance,, Chinese, opera, and, mummers', plays., Dance[edit], A, ballroom, dance, exhibition, Main, article:, Dance, Dance, (from, Old, French, dancier,, of, unknown, origin)[17], generally, refers, to, human, movement, either, used, as, a, form, of, expression, or, presented, in, a, social,, spiritual, or, performance, setting., Dance, is, also, used, to, describe, methods, of, non-verbal, communication, (see, body, language), between, humans, or, animals, (bee, dance,, mating, dance),, motion, in, inanimate, objects, (the, leaves, danced, in, the, wind),, and, certain, musical, forms, or, genres., Choreography, is, the, art, of, making, dances,, and, the, person, who, does, this, is, called, a, choreographer., People, danced, to, relieve, stress.[citation, needed], Definitions, of, what, constitutes, dance, are, dependent, on, social,, cultural,, aesthetic,, artistic, and, moral, constraints, and, range, from, functional, movement, (such, as, Folk, dance), to, codified,, virtuoso, techniques, such, as, ballet., In, sports,, gymnastics,, figure, skating, and, synchronized, swimming, are, dance, disciplines, while, Martial, arts, "kata", are, often, compared, to, dances., Multidisciplinary, artistic, works[edit], Ernestine, Schumann-Heink, as, Waltraute, Areas, exist, in, which, artistic, works, incorporate, multiple, artistic, fields,, such, as, film,, opera, and, performance, art., While, opera, is, often, categorized, in, the, performing, arts, of, music,, the, word, itself, is, Italian, for, "works,", because, opera, combines, several, artistic, disciplines, in, a, singular, artistic, experience., In, a, typical, traditional, opera,, the, entire, work, utilizes, the, following:, the, sets, (visual, arts),, costumes, (fashion),, acting, (dramatic, performing, arts),, the, libretto,, or, the, words/story, (literature),, and, singers, and, an, orchestra, (music)., The, composer, Richard, Wagner, recognized, the, fusion, of, so, many, disciplines, into, a, single, work, of, opera,, exemplified, by, his, cycle, Der, Ring, des, Nibelungen, ("The, Ring, of, the, Nibelung")., He, did, not, use, the, term, opera, for, his, works,, but, instead, Gesamtkunstwerk, ("synthesis, of, the, arts"),, sometimes, referred, to, as, "Music, Drama", in, English,, emphasizing, the, literary, and, theatrical, components, which, were, as, important, as, the, music., Classical, ballet, is, another, form, which, emerged, in, the, 19th, century, in, which, orchestral, music, is, combined, with, dance., Other, works, in, the, late, 19th,, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, have, fused, other, disciplines, in, unique, and, creative, ways,, such, as, performance, art., Performance, art, is, a, performance, over, time, which, combines, any, number, of, instruments,, objects,, and, art, within, a, predefined, or, less, well-defined, structure,, some, of, which, can, be, improvised., Performance, art, may, be, scripted,, unscripted,, random, or, carefully, organized;, even, audience, participation, may, occur.John, Cage, is, regarded, by, many, as, a, performance, artist, rather, than, a, composer,, although, he, preferred, the, latter, term., He, did, not, compose, for, traditional, ensembles., Cage's, composition, Living, Room, Music, composed, in, 1940, is, a, "quartet", for, unspecified, instruments,, really, non-melodic, objects,, which, can, be, found, in, a, living, room, of, a, typical, house,, hence, the, title., Video, games[edit], Main, article:, Video, games, as, an, art, form, A, debate, exists, in, the, fine, arts, and, video, game, cultures, over, whether, video, games, can, be, counted, as, an, art, form.[18], Game, designer, Hideo, Kojima, professes, that, video, games, are, a, type, of, service,, not, an, art, form,, because, they, are, meant, to, entertain, and, attempt, to, entertain, as, many, people, as, possible,, rather, than, being, a, single, artistic, voice, (despite, Kojima, himself, being, considered, a, gaming, auteur,, and, the, mixed, opinions, his, games, typically, receive)., However,, he, acknowledged, that, since, video, games, are, made, up, of, artistic, elements, (for, example,, the, visuals),, game, designers, could, be, considered, museum, curators, -, not, creating, artistic, pieces,, but, arranging, them, in, a, way, that, displays, their, artistry, and, sells, tickets., In, May, 2011,, the, National, Endowment, of, the, Arts, included, video, games, in, its, redefinition, of, what, is, considered, a, "work, of, art", when, applying, of, a, grant.[19], In, 2012,, the, Smithsonian, American, Art, Museum, presented, an, exhibit,, The, Art, of, the, Video, Game.[20], Reviews, of, the, exhibit, were, mixed,, including, questioning, whether, video, games, belong, in, an, art, museum., Gastronomy[edit], Main, article:, Gastronomy, Gastronomy, is, the, study, of, the, relationship, between, culture, and, food., It, is, often, thought, erroneously, that, the, term, gastronomy, refers, exclusively, to, the, art, of, cooking, (see, culinary, art),, but, this, is, only, a, small, part, of, this, discipline;, it, cannot, always, be, said, that, a, cook, is, also, a, gourmet., Gastronomy, studies, various, cultural, components, with, food, as, its, central, axis., Thus,, it, is, related, to, the, Fine, Arts, and, Social, Sciences,, and, even, to, the, Natural, Sciences, in, terms, of, human, nutritious, activity, and, digestive, function., Arts, criticism[edit], Architecture, criticism, Visual, art, criticism, Dance, criticism, Film, criticism,
