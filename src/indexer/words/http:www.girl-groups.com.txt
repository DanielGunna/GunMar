Gems, When, This, Little, Girl, Gets, Through-Screen, Gems, Whatever, Happened, to, our, Love--no, markings., (This, one, is, not, the, Avons, version., It, is, slower, and, has, fewer, production, elements.), These, came, from, a, stack, of, demos, found, in, a, closet, at, Muhlenberg, College,, a, part, of, their, old, 1960s, record, library., Anyone, have, a, clue?, If, so,, email, Webrocker!, Do, you, know, the, answers?, More, Queries!, From, time, to, time, we, get, inquiries, about, girl, groups, we, know, nothing, about,, and, even, Googling, will, not, help!, Donna, Price, of, California, asks,, "What, were, the, names, of, the, members, of, Tammy, and, the, Carolinas?, Has, anyone, heard, of, them, and, know, who, they, were?", We, know, only, of, one, single,, "You, Took, Me, for, Granted,", backed, with,, "I, Don't, Wanna, Play, in, Your, Yard,", which, appeared, on, Larson, Records, in, 1961., The, song, was, written, by, Glen, Larson,, who, was, a, member, of, the, Four, Preps, singing, group., They, backed, up, Ricky, Nelson,, but, in, his, spare, time,, he, wrote, TV, scripts., That, proved, to, be, his, claim, to, fame,, as, he, became, well-known, for, creating, many, popular, TV, series,, including, "Battlestar, Galactica,", "Quincy,", and, "Magnum, P.I.", Austin, Case, would, like, to, know, more, about, "Gigi, Parker", of, "Gigi, Parker, and, the, Lonelies.", They, had, an, obscure, single, in, 1964, entitled, "Beatles, Please, Come, Back, to, Me,", which, has, since, been, released, in, a, CD, compilation, on, Beatle, novelty, records., After, that, single,, Gigi, Parker, released, a, solo, song,, "Lonely, Girl, Blue,", backed, by, the, Four, Seasons., Who, was, Gigi, Parker?, Where, was, she, from?, Were, the, Lonelies, an, actual, band,, or, a, studio, backup, group?, We, know, they, worked, with, Bob, Crewe., If, you, know, anything, about, either, of, these, groups,, please, email, me, at, Webrocker!, Oldies,, oldies,,

of, the, Pixies, trio, were, actually, paired, on, tour, with, the, hard-rocking, Stones., Here, are, some, memories, of, that, tour, from, the, group, members, themselves..., We, worked, with, the, Rolling, Stones, on, their, first, American, tour, in, summer, 1964., It, was, one, of, those, multi-act, shows, with, The, Dave, Clark, Five, there,, too., Not, sure, if, there, were, other, bands,, but, there, may, have, been., The, Dave, Clark, Five, was, a, hit, with, the, audience., Of, course,, they, were, dressed, in, matching, outfits, and, were, well-groomed., But, the, Stones, were, not, well-received, by, audiences, and, were, panned, by, the, media., Their, look, was, new, and, strange, to, the, audience,, we'd, guess,, and, their, music, was, a, harder, rock, than, Americans, were, used, to., We, hung, out, with, the, Dave, Clark, Five,, since, they, were, our, ages,, and, cute, and, fun, to, be, with., The, Stones, kept, to, themselves,, usually, behind, closed, doors., You, can, imagine,, given, the, times, and, the, fact, that, they, were, older,, that, their, offstage, persona, was, as, foreign, to, us, as, their, onstage, performance., Actually,, it, was, the, only, group, we, ever, worked, with, that, ignored, us., Maybe, they, were, embarrassed, about, their, reviews., They, were, fairly, successful, in, the, UK, at, that, time, and, were, surprised, not, to, receive, the, kind, of, welcome, that, the, Dave, Clark, Five, got., Of, course,, we, all, know, this, was, short-lived,, as, the, Stones, returned, to, the, U.S., in, the, fall, of, 1964, and, were, treated, like, gods, by, the, media, and, the, public., They, were, just, ahead, of, their, time, for, their, look., And, their, sound, became, de, rigueur, for, rock, bands, after, them., At, that, time,, none, of, us, would, have, ever, guessed, they, could, become, rock, icons,, popular, even, 40, years, later!, Back, to, top,  , For, the, first, time, visitor..., Back, to, the, old, days, Remember, the, early, 1960s...when, Coke, was, just, a, soft, drink...when, the, only, nudity, you, saw, was, a, Barbie, doll,, between, outfits...when, the, biggest, worry, was, who, Johnny, would, invite, to, the, prom?, Girl-groups.com, takes, you, back, to, those, days,, to, the, fab, era, of, early, 1960s, girl, groups., Most, people, can, remember, the, Supremes,, the, Ronettes,, and, the, Shangri-las., But, there, were, actually, hundreds, of, artists,, both, groups, and, solo, singers,, who, were, part, of, the, girl-group, era, from, 1960-1966., Who, were, these, singers?, Who, made, the, sound?, Why, was, it, so, famous,, and, suddenly, gone?, Here, you'll, find, an, interesting, history, of, the, girl, groups., Do, you, remember, a, kooky, song, title?, Check, out, our, songs,
