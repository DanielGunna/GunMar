[skip, to, main, |, skip, to, sidebar, Film, Notes, From, the, CMA, Series, A, selection, of, notes, from, programs, that, I, curated, at, the, Columbus, Museum, of, Art, between, 1979, to, 1992., All, material, is, copyrighted., Saturday,, April, 10,, 2010, The, Great, Detectives, Sleuth, Again, Everyone, loves, a, mystery,, or, so, it, seems, from, the, continued, popularity, of, the, genre., Certainly,, the, puzzle-like, structure, of, mystery, novels, and, films, offers, both, a, challenge, and, a, satisfaction, rarely, found, in, other, genres., It, is, with, this, in, mind, that, we, present, another, series, of, films, full, of, shocking, murders,, stunning, deductions,, and, a, host, of, unlikely, suspects, with, even, more, unlikely, alibies., We, begin, this, year's, series, with, the, 1938, production, of, the, Sherlock, Holmes, tale, Silver, Blaze., The, film, was, the, last, in, the, series, starring, Arthur, Wontner,, one, of, the, most, noteworthy, actors, to, play, the, role, prior, to, Basil, Rathbone., Wontner, played, the, part, in, five, films, made, during, the, 1930s, and,, though, each, film, varied, in, its, fidelity, to, the, source,, Wontner's, interpretation, of, Holmes, remained, faithful, to, Doyle's, stories., Though, essentially, based, on, the, short, story, of, the, same, name,, Silver, Blaze, also, borrowed, plot, elements, and, characters, from, The, Hound, of, the, Baskervilles, and, "The, Adventure, of, the, Empty, House.", Although, the, film, was, updated, to, a, contemporary, setting, and, given, a, few, "modern", touches,, it, retains, the, spirit, of, the, original, stories, and, a, strong, sense, of, authenticity., One, of, the, more, popular, movie, detectives, of, the, 1930s, was, Philo, Vance., First, portrayed, by, William, Powell,, the, role, of, Vance, established, him, as, an, important, leading, man., When, Powell, left, the, Vance, series, for, the, Thin, Man, films,, he, was, replaced, by, Warren, William., By, the, mid-1930s,, Warren, William, had, become, known, as, a, second-string, William, Powell--an, ironic, twist, considering, that, in, the, early, 1930s, William, had, been, a, major, romantic, leading, man., The, Philo, Vance, films, starring, Warren, William, tended, to, experiment, with, the, material., A, film, which, we, have, previously, shown, in, this, series,, The, Gracie, Allen, Murder, Case, (1939),, was, essentially, a, parody, of, the, Vance, films., This, year, we, are, showing, The, Dragon, Murder, Case, (1934),, which, was, produced, as, a, mixture, of, murder, mystery, and, horror, film., The, film's, central, plot, device,, a, pool, which, is, supposedly, haunted, by, a, ghostly, dragon,, allowed, the, photography, and, set, design, to, exploit, the, gothic, style, that, was, common, to, horror, movies, of, the, 1930s., While, the, character, of, "Bulldog", Drummond, is, little, known, today,, during, the, 1930s, numerous, films, were, made, about, his, adventures., The, character, of, Drummond, was, played, by, a, long, and, distinguished, list, of, actors, including, such, performers, as, Ronald, Colman,, Jack, Buchanan,, Ralph, Richardson,, and, Ray, Milland., Such, was, the, popularity, of, these, films, that,, by, the, mid-1930s,, as, many, as, two, to, five, Drummond, films, were, released, per, year., The, original, character, of, Captain, Hugh, "Bulldog", Drummond,, as, created, by, H., C., "Sapper", McNeile,, was, an, ex-soldier, who, turned, to, crime, fighting, because, he, found, peace, time, life, too, boring., The, literary, Drummond, tended, to, be, a, rough, and, violent, figure,, but, the, screen-version, of, the, character, was, the, epitome, of, sophistication., His, cases, also, tended, to, be, a, bit, on, the, fantastic, side,, filled, with, daring, escapes, and, beautiful, women., In, this, regard,, Drummond, is, the, direct, forerunner, to, the, character, of, James, Bond., Bulldog, Drummond, Escapes, (1937), was, the, first, film, in, the, American-produced, Drummond, series, of, the, late, 1930s., Both, the, film's, narrative, and, Ray, Milland's, performance, were, based, on, the, earlier, Drummond, films, which, had, starred, Ronald, Colman., It, was, also, the, last, Drummond, film, of, the, 1930s, produced, on, an, adequate, budget, before, the, series, began, to, suffer, from, diminished, popularity, caused, by, overexposure., Even, though, his, career, went, through, a, gradual, decline, during, the, 1930s,, Warren, William, frequently, appeared, in, the, mystery, films, of, this, period., By, the, middle, of, the, decade, he, was, appearing, on, screen, as, Philo, Vance,, the, Lone, Wolf,, and, Perry, Mason., William, would, originate, the, role, of, Mason, in, four, films,, beginning, with, The, Case, of, the, Howling, Dog, (1934)., As, the, first, in, the, series,, The, Case, of, the, Howling, Dog, was, produced, on, the, largest, budget., While, this, film, takes, certain, liberties, with, the, original, novel,, it, contained, the, best-structured, plot, of, the, series, and, was, devoid, of, any, unnecessary, comedy, relief., In, contrast,, humor, is, the, central, focus, of, the, four, Miss, Jane, Marple, films, made, in, England, in, the, early, 1960s., The, series, began, in, 1962, with, Murder,, She, Said,, a, loosely, derived, adaptation, of, the, Agatha, Christie, novel, 4:50, From, Paddington., The, film, retained, the, basic, plot, points, of, the, novel,, but, was, extensively, revamped, in, order, to, showcase, the, unique, and, eccentric, talents, of, Margaret, Rutherford,, who, played, Jane, Marple., Rutherford,, an, actress,, comedienne,, and, amateur, psychic,, represented, a, distinctly, British, combination, of, stubborn, determination, and, whimsy., Though, her, portrayal, of, Miss, Jane, Marple, was, far, removed, from, the, character, conceived, by, Christie,, Rutherford, did, succeed, in, creating, one, of, the, more, striking, detectives, to, ever, grace, the, screen., Posted, by, Dennis, Toth, at, 9:10, AM, No, comments:, The, Great, Detectives, Part, Two, In, the, thirties,, the, mystery, film, was, one, of, the, most, popular, genres, of, the, Hollywood, film, industry., The, audience's, demand, for, the, films, was, enormous, and, every, studio, had, at, least, one, detective, series, in, production., Not, only, were, many, mystery, novels, filmed,, they, even, had, their, plots, recycled, into, other, films, in, order, to, meet, this, demand., Though, prints, of, many, of, these, films, no, longer, exist,, there, are, still, copies, from, some, of, the, major, detective, series, from, the, period., In, this, continuation, of, last, summer's, program,, we, present, five, examples, of, the, genre,, many, of, which, have, seldom, been, screened, since, the, thirties., For, many, viewers,, Basil, Rathbone, is, the, definitive, Sherlock, Holmes., When, he, initially, appeared, as, Holmes,, however,, Rathbone, was, unfavorably, compared, to, Clive, Brook,, who, played, the, role, in, only, three, films, (The, Return, of, Sherlock, Holmes, [1929], ,, Paramount, on, Parade, [, 1930],and, Sherlock, Holmes, [1932]),, but, made, a, major, impression, on, viewers., Of, the, three, films,, the, last, is, considered, critically, the, best., Based, both, on, the, play, by, William, Gillette, and, Sir, Arthur, Conan, Doyle, and, on, the, short, story, "The, Red, Headed, League,", the, film, Sherlock, Holmes, is, best, remembered, for, its, confrontations, between, Holmes, and, his, arch-enemy, Moriarty., Like, many, of, the, Holmes, films, of, the, thirties,, the, story, was, updated, to, the, period, and, Moriarty's, antics, were, modeled, after, the, gangster, tactics, of, Al, Capone., The, possible, incongruity, of, the, part, of, Moriarty, were, smoothly, handled, by, Ernest, Torrence,, whose, performance, was, an, excellent, counterpoint, to, Brook's, droll, and, extremely, self-assured, Holmes., Sherlock, Holmes, is, also, notable, for, its, photography, which, was, strongly, influenced, by, the, German, Expressionist, cinema, of, the, twenties., The, best, of, the, Philo, Vance, films, are, those, starring, William, Powell., Unfortunately,, the, only, one, of, those, films, still, known, to, exist, is, The, Kennel, Murder, Case, (shown, last, summer)., Of, the, other, actors, who, played, the, role,, Warren, William, came, closest, to, equaling, Powell., In, the, 1939, film, The, Gracie, Allen, Murder, Case,, William, made, his, last, appearance, as, Vance, in, one, of, the, strangest, films, of, the, series., S., S., Van, Dine,, the, author, of, the, Philo, Vance, mystery, novels,, was, a, fan, of, Gracie, Allen, and, wrote, the, original, story, for, her., Critics, were, often, annoyed, by, Vance's, intellectual, arrogance, and, demanding, logic, and, the, film, may, have, been, Van, Dine's, rebuttal, to, his, detractors., In, The, Gracie, Allen, Murder, Case,, Vance, remains, coldly, deductive,, even, when, faced, with, Gracie, Allen's, puns, and, farcial, comedy., It, is, not, surprising, that, The, Gracie, Allen, Murder, Case, has, become, a, major, cult, film, at, repertory, theaters., Of, the, three, versions, of, The, Maltese, Falcon,, the, 1941, film, with, Humphrey, Bogart, is, undoubtably, the, best, known., It, was,, however,, modeled, after, the, 1931, version, starring, Ricardo, Cortez., Both, films, were, faithful, to, the, original, novel, by, Dashiell, Hammett, and, the, two, productions, rival, each, other, in, the, exactness, of, their, casting, of, the, major, characters., Though, Cortez, was, fashioned, as, a, Latin, lover, in, the, Valentino, mold, during, the, twenties,, he, changed, to, playing, tough, guys, and, made, an, effective, Sam, Spade, in, the, thirties., The, visual, similiarities, between, the, two, versions, are, very, striking., It, is, believed, that, John, Huston,, prior, to, directing, the, 1941, film,, watched, the, earlier, production, and, used, it, as, a, visual, outline., That, the, compositions, in, many, scenes, are, almost, identical, would, seem, to, support, this, theory., Though, Huston's, version, is, still, superior,, the, original, The, Maltese, Falcon, is, one, of, the, most, engaging, mystery, films, of, the, early, thirties., Only, two, Nero, Wolfe, films, were, made, in, the, thirties, before, author, Rex, Stout, withdrew, the, film, rights, to, his, other, stories., Stout, was, appalled, by, the, two, films, due, to, certain, liberties, taken, with, the, main, characters., In, spite, of, their, less, than, faithful, approach,, the, two, films, were, well, crafted, mysteries., Meet, Nero, Wolfe, (shown, last, summer), had, Edward, Arnold, more, suitably, cast, in, the, title, role, rather, than, Walter, Connolly, who, played, Wolfe, in, The, League, of, Frightened, Men., But, the, second, film, had, a, better, plot, which, compensated, for, any, failings, on, Connolly's, part., The, narrative, of, The, League, of, Frightened, Men, is, unique, in, that, Nero, Wolfe, must, first, establish, that, a, murder, has, taken, place, before, he, can, solve, it., Matching, wits, with, Wolfe, is, a, deranged, playwright, who, was, superbly, played, by, Eduardo, Ciannelli., The, comedy, relief, provided, by, Lionel, Stander, will, annoy, the, purist,, but, The, League, of, Frightened, Men, is, generally, considered, to, be, one, of, the, better, mystery, films, of, the, period., The, most, successful, mystery, series, of, the, thirties, were, the, Thin, Man, films, starring, William, Powell, and, Myrna, Loy., Combining, murder, with, sophisticated, comedy,, the, Thin, Man, films, maintained, an, unequaled, level, of, quality., The, interplay, between, Powell, and, Loy, was, graceful, and, effortless, and, the, films, were, produced, by, MGM, as, large, budget, productions., The, third, film, in, the, series,, Another, Thin, Man,, was, based, on, an, original, story, by, Dashiell, Hammett., Viewers, familiar, with, Hammett's, novels, will, notice, that, the, story, was, derived, from, The, Dain, Curse., While, Hammett, provided, the, story,, screenwriters, Frances, Goodrich, and, Albert, Hackett, supplied, the, witty, dialogue., Another, Thin, Man, veers, so, close, to, screwball, comedy, that, the, mystery, is, often, less, memorable, than, the, funny, banter, between, Powell, and, Loy., While, many, mystery, films, of, the, thirties, attempted, to, include, comedy, relief,, the, Thin, Man, films, were, the, only, ones, to, successfully, make, comedy, an, integral, part, of, the, story., Posted, by, Dennis, Toth, at, 8:51, AM, No, comments:, The, Great, Detectives, Nowhere, is, the, seductive, lure, of, the, narrative, more, evident, than, in, the, mystery, genre., The, puzzle-box, of, a, mystery, story, traps, even, the, most, disinterested, viewer, into, the, inevitable, desire, to, know, "how, does, it, end.", The, mystery, genre, follows, a, simple, yet, riveting, set, of, rules:, a, respectable, facade, or, order, is, disrupted, by, murder;, an, outside, force, in, the, person, of, the, detective, proceeds, to, expose, the, potential, chaos, behind, the, facade;, the, final, discovery, of, the, murderer, restores, order,, but, usually, at, some, physical, or, psychological, cost, to, the, original, order., Since, Oedipus, first, demanded, to, know, "who, did, it,", the, structure, of, the, genre, has, remained, relatively, unchanged., The, thirties, and, forties, were, the, two, most, active, decades, for, mystery, movies., While, crime, didn't, pay,, people, were, certainly, willing, to, pay, to, see, it, and, every, studio, had, its, various, sleuths,, gumshoes,, Oriental, masterminds,, and, bumbling, policemen., So, many, mystery, films, were, made, during, this, period, that, plots, were, literally, recycled, with, only, the, names, of, the, characters, changed, to, protect, the, screenwriters., The, program, The, Great, Detectives, presents, four, of, the, best, examples, from, this, hectic, period, of, gentlemanly, mayhem., Having, appeared, in, over, a, hundred, films, since, the, silent, era,, the, team, of, Sherlock, Holmes, and, Dr., Watson, was, undoubtedly, best, represented, by, Basil, Rathbone, and, Nigel, Bruce., When, they, first, appeared, together, as, Holmes, and, Watson, in, the, 1939, production, of, The, Hound, of, the, Baskervilles,, the, studio, was, uncertain, about, the, match, but, the, film, was, so, successful, that, a, sequel, was, quickly, produced, the, same, year., This, second, film,, The, Adventures, of, Sherlock, Holmes,, remains, the, best, of, the, series, due, to, the, cleverness, of, its, plot, and, the, high, quality, of, its, production, (it, had, the, largest, budget, of, any, of, the, films)., The, film's, greatest, asset, is, the, creation, of, a, villain, who, is, Holmes's, equal., Professor, Moriarty, may, be, mad,, but, he, is, a, brilliant, and, often, engaging, madman, who, divides, his, time, between, plotting, elaborate, crimes, and, lecturing, people, on, the, difference, between, a, slave, and, a, superman., The, snobbish, and, excessively, erudite, Philo, Vance, was, one, of, the, most, popular, detectives, of, the, early, thirties., Vance, didn't, simply, solve, the, crime,, he, did, a, thesis, presentation, on, all, of, the, psychological, nuances, which, led, to, the, murder., A, member, of, the, velvet, smoking, jacket, school, of, detection,, Vance's, early, success, on, the, screen, was, largely, due, to, the, abilities, of, William, Powell, to, make, the, character, both, believable, and, sufferable., Previously, type-cast, as, a, villain,, Powell, proved, himself, as, a, leading, man, by, breathing, life, and, wit, into, a, perpetual, doctoral, candidate., The, Kennel, Murder, Case, is, one, of, the, most, complex, of, the, Vance, mysteries, and, is, still, notorious, for, having, one, of, the, longest, denouement, scenes, ever., This, excessive, attention, to, detail, eventually, led, to, the, unpopularity, of, the, Vance, films, as, the, Dashiell, Hammett, school, of, tough-guy, detectives, introduced, a, quicker, and, more, physical, method., It, is, ironic, that, the, one, flaw, to, The, Kennel, Murder, Case, is, an, incorrect, detail., The, set, designer, for, the, film, altered, one, of, the, townhouses, in, a, way, that, made, the, solution, to, the, mystery, impossible., Perhaps, fewer, films, where, made, about, Nero, Wolfe, than, about, any, other, famous, detective., Wolfe's, creator,, Rex, Stout,, disliked, the, media, in, general, and, films, in, particular,, and, while, two, Wolfe, films, were, made, in, the, thirties,, Stout, felt, that, they, were, not, faithful, enough, to, his, stories, and, he, refused, to, allow, any, further, productions., The, films,, Meet, Nero, Wolfe, and, The, League, of, Frightened, Men,, were, taken, out, of, circulation, and, were, not, commercially, re-released, until, 1982., The, reputation, of, the, films,, especially, Meet, Nero, Wolfe,, has, remained, strong,, however,, and, Stout's, criticism, of, the, films, is, largely, indicative, of, his, own, demanding, temperament., The, casting, of, Lionel, Stander, as, Wolfe's, assistant, was,, admittedly,, a, mistake., One, of, the, major, flaws, of, the, thirties, mystery, movie, was, the, conviction, that, every, film, needed, some, broad, comic, relief., Edward, Arnold, as, Wolfe,, however,, was, an, amply, appropriate, choice., An, excellent, character, actor,, Arnold, specialized, in, playing, arrogant,, overbearing, figures., Plump, more, than, fat,, Arnold, made, up, for, his, lack, of, excess, poundage, by, zeroing, in, on, Wolfe's, domineering, personality., While, the, recent, television, series, (with, William, Conrad), portrayed, Wolfe, as, a, gruff, but, lovable, old, bear,, Arnold, went, directly, for, the, jugular., His, Wolfe, is, good, at, what, he, does, and, only, does, it, because, his, client, pays, him, very, large, sums, for, doing, it., As, Wolfe, points, out, in, the, novels,, his, layers, of, fat, insulate, him, from, trite, sentimentality., Though, not, well, known, in, the, United, States,, the, Inspector, Cockrill, novels, have, a, strong, following, in, England., The, one, film, taken, from, these, books,, Green, for, Danger,, is, considered, by, many, critics, to, be, one, of, the, best, "whodunits", in, the, cinema., The, director,, Sidney, Gilliat,, had, been, one, of, Hitchcock's, chief, collaborators, in, the, thirties, and, the, film, gave, him, an, opportunity, to, pay, homage, to, his, mentor., The, role, of, Inspector, Cockrill, gave, Alastair, Sim's, droll, talent, a, near-perfect, showcase., With, his, shabby, mackintosh, and, crumpled,, ill-fitting, derby,, Cockrill, is, seemingly, slow, and, inept., Prone, to, rambling, comments, and, pointless, anecdotes,, Cockrill, actually, has, a, shrewd,, steel, trap, mind, which, seizes, significant, clues, from, seemingly, innocent, details., By, the, mid-forties,, the, mystery, film, began, to, vanish, from, the, screen., It, is, possible, that, the, conflict, inherent, in, the, genre, between, chaos, and, stability, ceased, to, make, sense, in, an, increasingly, unstable, world., In, popular, literature,, the, last, detective, to, achieve, widespread, fame, would, be, Mike, Hammer,, a, character, totally, submerged, in, violence, and, brutality., The, intellectual, game, of, the, mystery, was, irrelevant, as, the, new, anti-hero, did, his, detecting, with, gun, powder, rather, than, brain, power., Perhaps, the, secret, charm, of, the, thirties, mystery, film, is, our, own, nostalgia, for, an, era, when, murder, was, a, sport, for, gentlemen., Posted, by, Dennis, Toth, at, 8:24, AM, No, comments:, Sunday,, August, 16,, 2009, Modern, Japanese, Cinema, The, Japanese, began, producing, films, at, approximately, the, same, time, as, the, West,, but, while, the, Western, cinema, was, quickly, taking, shape,, the, Japanese, cinema, remained, relatively, stagnant., By, the, time, the, cinema, became, the, major, narrative, art, form, in, the, West,, the, typical, Japanese, film, served, as, a, form, of, illustration, for, the, bensei,, the, traditional, storyteller., The, center, of, attention, was, the, bensei, as, he, told, the, tale, and, the, film, was, used, primarily, as, a, visual, enhancement, for, tales, that, may, (or, may, not), have, been, related, to, the, original, narrative, of, the, movie., Meanwhile,, film, as, an, art, in, its, own, right, for, the, Japanese, only, existed, at, certain, specialty, theaters, which, showed, the, major, Russian,, American, and, German, films, of, the, era., It, was, not, until, the, 1920s,, when, various, film, directors, began, resisting, the, use, of, the, bensei,, that, the, Japanese, cinema, began, moving, in, its, own, unique, direction., The, foreign, films, of, the, 1920s, were, the, original, models, copied, by, such, early, Japanese, filmmakers, like, Kenji, Mizoguchi, and, Yasujiro, Ozu,, but, this, foreign, influence, was, only, the, raw, material, that, was, quickly, adapted, and, altered, into, distinctly, Japanese, forms., By, the, 1930s,, the, films, of, Ozu, and, Mizoguchi, were, considered, too, Japanese, to, be, understood, by, foreign, viewers., The, Japanese, cinema, is, also, one, of, the, few, national, film, industries, in, the, world, (the, other, main, example, being, Hollywood), that, has, had, a, long,, continuous, history, since, the, silent, era., However,, quantity, does, not, always, correspond, with, quality, (as, Hollywood, also, amply, demonstrates), and, the, Japanese, cinema's, history, has, gone, through, periods, of, immense, creatively, -, such, as, the, late, 1930s, and, the, 1950s, -, followed, by, other,, less, interesting, stages, of, standard, genre, melodramas,, potboilers,, and, the, occasional, soft-core, porn., Unfortunately,, the, Japanese, film, industry, is, currently, in, the, midst, of, such, a, period, and, the, exciting, and, innovative, films, of, the, 1960s, has, been, followed, by, economic, problems, within, the, industry, and, a, reluctance, on, the, part, of, producers, to, finance, anything, beyond, quickie, exploitation, films., American, movies, dominant, the, marketplace, and, an, upsurge, in, television, viewing, in, Japan, has, not, only, made, it, more, profitable, for, a, Japanese, director, to, work, in, television,, but, allows, the, director, to, achieve, greater, artistic, independence, on, the, small, box, rather, than, on, the, large, screen., The, few, important, artists, still, making, films, have, found, it, necessary, to, either, make, blatantly, commercial, thrillers, (which, is, what, Kon, Ichikawa, has, done), or, else, seek, international, backing, for, Japanese, films, (e.g., Nagisa, Oshima's, In, the, Realm, of, the, Senses, was, produced, by, a, French, company)., After, years, of, frustration,, Akira, Kurosawa, found, it, necessary, to, accept, the, Soviet's, offer, to, direct, the, non-Japanese, film, Dersu, Uzala, -, either, that, or, retire, from, film, making, altogether., The, 1960s, stands, out, as, the, most, recent, period, of, major, innovation, in, the, Japanese, cinema., It, was, a, period, that, was, fueled, by, national, and, international, upheavals, in, the, arts, and, by, a, growing, sense, of, disenchantment, among, the, younger, generation, of, Japanese, artists, with, many, aspects, of, the, society, in, which, they, lived., The, spirit, of, compromise, and, mild, optimism, found, among, the, Humanist, filmmakers, of, the, post-World, War, Two, era, was, replaced, with, a, more, formalistic, and, rebellious, attitude., New, forms, and, structures, were, developed, to, deal, more, critically, with, contemporary, subject, matter, while, those, filmmakers, who, dealt, with, historical, subjects, did, so, in, a, highly, self-conscious, effort, to, re-evaluate, Japanese, history, and, culture, in, light, of, the, present, situation., Double, Suicide, by, Masahiro, Shinoda, takes, a, Brechtian, approach, to, the, traditional, form, of, the, Bunraka, puppet, play,, purposefully, exposing, both, the, manipulations, of, the, puppet-masters, upon, the, actors, and, the, film, making, process, itself., The, avant-garde, in, Western, art, and, literature, had, a, strong, influence, upon, many, of, the, Japanese, filmmakers, of, the, 1960s,, a, "coming, full, circle", considering, the, influence, of, Japanese, art, upon, the, original, avante-garde, movement, in, the, West., When, Nagisa, Oshima, began, working, in, the, cinema,, he, was, more, impressed, with, the, films, of, the, French, New, Wave, than, he, was, with, his, own, country's, cinema, and, the, stylistic, similarities, between, his, films, and, those, of, Jean-Luc, Godard, has, not, been, overlooked, by, Western, critics., Likewise,, Woman, in, the, Dunes, is, obviously, derived, from, Franz, Kafka's, The, Castle, and, novelist/screenwriter, Kobo, Abe's, concerns, are, those, of, a, European, Existentialist., The, allegorical, content, of, the, film, is, structurally, austere, and, visually, Woman, in, the, Dunes, is, highly, similar, to, a, European, "art", film., As, previously, mentioned,, Japanese, culture, was, targeted, for, a, critical, re-evaluation., The, new, filmmakers, were, acutely, aware, of, the, changes, that, had, taken, place, in, modern, Japan, and, of, the, apparent, failure, of, traditional, values., This, failure, in, the, face, of, recent, history, is, perhaps, most, clearly, demonstrated, in, the, way, that, Oshima, chronologically, structures, The, Ceremony., The, various, ceremonies, of, the, film, are, set, during, politically, important, years, of, the, post-war, era., 1947,, at, the, beginning, of, the, film,, was, the, start, of, the, Cold, War, and, the, first, wave, of, "Red, Purges.", In, 1952,, the, U.S.-Japan, Security, Treaty, was, signed, and, Japan, began, to, reap, a, profit, from, U.S., involvement, in, the, Korean, War., That, same, year,, Japan's, Communist, Party, broke, with, the, students, (one, of, whom, was, Oshima), in, the, radical, movement., The, U.S.-Japan, Security, Treaty, was, renewed, in, 1961, despite, violent, protests., 1964, was, the, year, of, prosperity, and, the, Summer, Olympics, in, Tokyo., In, the, year, the, film, was, made, -, 1971, -, the, Security, Treaty, was, renewed, again, and, the, Japanese, writer, Yukio, Mishima, led, a, small, private, army, in, a, take-over, of, the, National, Security, Force, headquarters., Mishima's, siege, -, his, impassioned, speech, in, support, of, the, Emperor, and, "true", Japanese, culture, -, and, his, act, of, ritual, suicide, afterwards,, had, stunned, his, fellow, artists., In, spite, of, his, fanatical, right-wing, politics,, Mishima, was, an, influential, voice, to, both, sides, of, the, Japanese, political, spectrum, and, his, spectacular, death, forced, to, the, surface, the, self-destructive, contradictions, which, the, Japanese, intellect, is, seemingly, incapable, of, resolving., These, contradictions, -, the, disastrous, outcome, of, military, imperialism, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s;, the, massive, disruption, of, an, age-old, culture, and, the, overly, enthusiastic, embracing, of, things, American;, the, attempt, to, build, a, democracy, out, of, the, remains, of, a, politically, feudalistic, nation, while, simultaneously, maintaining, the, Emperor;, the, deep, relevance, for, the, beauty, of, nature, while, the, modern, landscape, is, transformed, into, an, industrial, wasteland, -, has, produced,, according, to, Kon, Ichikawa's, Odd, Obsession,, a, particular, kind, of, impotency, in, the, Japanese, soul., Bitter,, ironic, and, a, lover, of, macabre, humor,, Ichikawa, has, been, a, major, influence, upon, the, Japanese, filmmakers, of, the, 1960s, because,, says, Shinoda,, "he, makes, films, only, for, the, sake, of, making, films,, (his), work, has, a, kind, of, innocence, and, very, pure, pleasure., In, the, technical, realm, he, has, been, the, most, influential, in, pointing, out, directions, for, the, avant-garde....", His, willingness, to, experiment, (he, made, one, film, told, from, the, point, of, view, of, a, cat), and, sheer, audacity, in, subject, matter, (after, Odd, Obsession, he, made, Fires, on, the, Plains, in, which, a, group, of, stranded, soldiers, resort, to, cannibalism), is, often, combined, with, an, ambiguous, moral, viewpoint., Unlike, many, of, the, other, Humanist, directors, of, the, 1950s,, Ichikawa, ask, questions, rather, than, teach, lessons, and, the, vague, optimism, of, his, contemporaries, is, replaced, with, a, biting, pessimism., Posted, by, Dennis, Toth, at, 1:49, PM, No, comments:, Sunday,, June, 21,, 2009, The, Debonairs:, Gary, Grant, and, William, Powell, The, art, of, film, acting, is, a, difficult, skill., Unlike, the, direct, and, immediate, impact, of, the, live, theater,, a, film, actor, pokes, his, way, through, small,, disorderly, pieces, of, a, screenplay,, and, the, quality, of, his, performance, is, often, more, dependent, upon, lighting, directors,, photographers,, and, editors, than, his, own, thespian, talents., At, best,, a, film, actor, can, develop, a, personality,, a, distinctive, style, which, becomes, his, "character", through, a, series, of, films., In, other, words,, he, comes, to, represent, a, specific, type, of, character, to, such, an, extent, that, to, cast, him, in, a, film, would,, in, part,, determine, the, nature, of, the, film., Such, actors, do, not, merely, play, at, being, a, character, in, a, film, but, instead, play, "themselves.", That, is,, they, play, a, consciously, created, character, that, becomes, their, screen, personality., Of, this, type, of, performer,, perhaps, two, of, the, most, distinctive, yet, under-rated, have, been, Gary, Grant, and, William, Powell., Both, Grant, and, Powell, became, identified, with, a, certain, type, of, role,, that, of, the, urbane,, sophisticated, leading, man, in, romantic, comedies., As, masters, of, the, debonair,, Grant, and, Powell, developed, personalities, which, allowed, them, to, move, through, a, performance, with, a, smoothness, and, an, apparent, lack, of, effort, which, made, their, acting, look, all, too, easy, and, natural, to, be, considered, acting., Because, of, this,, recognition, of, their, talent, was, not, given, until, late, in, their, careers., Yet, their, popularity, with, audiences, remains, strong, and,, in, spite, of, numerous, recent, attempts,, no, contemporary, performer, has, been, capable, of, matching, them, for, grace,, wit,, and, charming, self-assurance., The, transformation, from, Archibald, Leach, to, Gary, Grant, was,, in, itself,, a, major, performance., As, a, shy, and, introverted, child, from, a, middle-class, family, in, Bristol,, England,, Grant, was, surprisingly, determined, when,, at, the, age, of, thirteen,, he, left, home, to, join, the, Bob, Pender, Troupe., It, was, with, this, group, that, Grant, learned, acrobatics,, dancing,, pantomime,and, a, variety, of, other, skills,, as, well, as, a, motto, which, he, later, adopted, as, his, own:, "Never, stay, on, too, long., Never, let, the, audience, get, tired, of, you., Always, leave, them, laughing, and, wanting, more.", Born, in, Pittsburgh, and, raised, in, Kansas, City,, William, Horatio, Powell, seemed, an, even, more, unlikely, candidate, for, the, debonair, school, of, acting., Powell, originally, entered, law, school, at, the, University, of, Kansas, before, he, decided, to, defy, his, father's, wishes., Borrowing, $700, from, his, aunt,, Powell, left, the, legal, profession, after, two, weeks, of, classes, and, enrolled, in, New, York's, American, Academy, of, Dramatic, Art., While, the, English, music, halls, became, Gary, Grant's, training, ground,, Powell, studied, his, craft, through, the, more, conventional, route, of, stock, companies, and, the, Broadway, theater., The, films, in, this, program, have, been, selected, to, emphasize, particular, aspects, of, both, Grant's, and, Powell's, screen, personalities., The, two, films, starring, Gary, Grant, represent, his, portrayal, of, a, distinctly, masculine, male, who, undergoes, a, series, of, humiliations, that, become, a, test, of, both, love, and, character., In, The, Awful, Truth,, he, plays, the, role, of, a, philandering, husband, who, discovers, his, own, enormous, potential, for, jealousy, in, the, first, ten, minutes, of, the, film., The, mutual, attempts, of, Grant, and, Irene, Dunne, to, sabotage, each, other's, love, affairs, become, not, only, the, proof, that, they, still, love, each, other,, but, is, also, the, force, by, which, they, achieve, a, new, equality, in, their, relationship., Their, romantic, rivals, (Ralph, Bellamy, and, Molly, Lament), are, not, so, much, sexual, contenders, as, they, are, pawns, in, the, marital, game., By, the, end, of, the, film,, Grant, and, Dunne, have, to, be, reconciled, because, no, one, else, can, put, up, with, them., I, Was, a, Male, War, Bride, goes, even, further, with, sexual, humiliation., Beginning, with, an, antagonistic, relationship, of, equality, (Ann, Sheridan's, WAC, lieutenant, behaves, in, almost, as, masculine, a, manner, as, Grant's, captain), the, film, follows, a, progressively, unequal, path., The, more, romantically, involved, Grant, and, Sheridan, become,, the, more, humiliation, Grant, must, suffer,, whether, in, the, form, of, an, errant, motorcycle, or, the, rigid, bureaucracy, of, the, U.S., Army., Grant's, impersonation, of, a, woman, officer, during, the, final, third, of, the, film, is, not, only, a, travesty, of, his, own, masculinity,, but, also, a, satire, on, the, military, mentality., Never, has, a, man, looked, less, like, a, woman, (even, Grant's, wig, is, obviously, a, bobbed, horse's, tail),, but, the, fact, that, he's, dressed, like, a, woman, and, has, signed, all, the, forms, as, Mrs., makes, him, a, woman, according, to, the, rules, and, regulations, of, the, army., The, William, Powell, films, are, representative, of, the, type, of, comedies, which, made, him, famous, during, the, thirties, and, forties., In, both, films, he, is, teamed, with, Myrna, Loy,, his, most, popular, leading, lady., Double, Wedding, is, an, ideal, sample, of, the, type, of, romantic, screwball, comedy, films, which, they, made, during, the, period;, films, in, which, logic, took, a, highly, circular, route, and, the, most, improbable, events, came, about, in, probable, ways., The, central, plot, in, Double, Wedding,, Powell's, conviction, that, the, only, way, to, win, the, woman, he, loves, is, by, courting, her, sister,, only, makes, sense, within, the, uniquely, whimsical, confines, of, a, Powell-Loy, comedy., Like, the, other, films, of, its, type,, Double, Wedding, does, not, convince, the, viewer, with, its, narrative, rationale,, but, instead, succeeds, in, winning, our, suspension, of, disbelief., Shadow, of, the, Thin, Man, presents, Powell, in, his, most, famous, persona, as, private, detective, Nick, Charles., The, fourth, of, a, series, of, six, Thin, Man, films,, Shadow, of, the, Thin, Man, was, the, last, film, of, the, series, to, be, directed, by, W.S., Van, Dyke, before, his, death., Van, Dyke, had, directed, the, previous, three, films,, which, accounts, for, their, consistent, wit, and, style., The, two, films, which, came, after, this, one, (The, Thin, Man, Goes, Home, and, The, Song, of, the, Thin, Man), are, noticeably, lacking, the, urbane, polish, of, Van, Dyke's, productions, which, lead, to, the, films', loss, of, popularity, at, the, time., As, murder, mysteries, go,, the, Thin, Man, films, became, increasingly, marginal,, but, as, witty, comedy, films, they, remained, fresh, and, inventive, and, were, the, best, showcase, for, the, "perfectly, married", teamwork, of, Powell, and, Loy., Posted, by, Dennis, Toth, at, 11:02, AM, No, comments:, Labels:, Cary_Grant,, Irene_Dunne,, William_Powell, Sunday,, April, 19,, 2009, Point, Blank:, Films, of, Disenchantment, The, Film, Noir, genre, has, functioned, in, the, American, cinema, as, a, powerful, fulcrum, for, the, disturbances, and, discontent, of, modern, society., The, genre's, tendencies, toward, glib, cynicism, and, dark, shadowy, photography, result, in, nightmarish, reflections, of, a, treacherous, and, claustrophobic, world., Through, this, genre,, numerous, filmmakers, have, been, able, to, express, the, negative, underside, to, the, optimism, and, complacency, of, mainstream, culture., With, its, codes, and, generic, conventions,, Film, Noir, has, created, a, large, and, substantial, text, of, critical, disenchantment., The, program, "Point, Blank:, Films, of, Disenchantment", presents, three, significant, examples, of, Film, Noir, from, the, late, 1960s, to, late, 1970s,, when, the, genre, reached, its, most, extreme, and, experimental, stage, of, development., Jack, Shadoian,, in, his, book, Dreams, and, Dead, Ends:, The, American, Gangster/Crime, Film,, writes, that, at, this, time, the, genre, "is, forced, inward,, toward, its, own, procedures,, which, become, increasingly, sophisticated., It, used, to, be, that, well, established, procedures, could, be, used, to, move, outward, toward, an, audience, they, could, securely, engage., Now, the, audience, must, be, seduced, into, accepting, new, aesthetic, resources, and, complex, (and, at, times, schizophrenic), attitudes.", The, program, begins, with, a, screening, of, Point, Blank, (USA, 1967),, the, second, theatrical, film, to, be, directed, by, the, English, filmmaker, John, Boorman, in, his, first,, and, nearly, last,, American, production., The, audacious, and, highly, experimental, style, of, the, film, alienated, the, American, distributors,, who, proceeded, to, dump, Point, Blank, on, the, second-run, market., In, spite, of, this,, the, film, has, proven, to, be, one, of, the, more, important, and, influential, works, of, the, 1960s., It, is, also, one, of, the, most, difficult, to, interpret., Even, the, existence, of, the, film's, central, character, is, left, open;, Boorman, himself, has, stated, that, Point, Blank, must, be, viewed, as, either, a, dream, or, as, a, ghost, story., The, rampant, ambiguities, of, the, narrative, are, magnified, by, a, visual, structure, based, upon, fragmentation, and, non, chronological, association., When, Walker,, the, main, character,, traverses, the, length, of, the, Los, Angeles, International, Airport,, his, footsteps, are, inter-cut, with, scenes, from, the, past, and, present., The, ending, shot, is, a, duplicate, of, the, opening, shot., In, addition,, mythic, references, are, invoked;, for, example,, at, the, beginning, of, the, film,, Walker, ascends, from, the, water, and,, ultimately,, descends, into, darkness, and, nothingness, --, both, suggestive, of, Boorman's, interest, in, Arthurian, legend., Remember, My, Name, (USA, 1978), was, the, first, of, three, overt, excursions, into, Film, Noir, genre, by, the, maverick, American, filmmaker, Alan, Rudolph., It, is, also, an, important, example, of, a, relatively, recent, proto-feminist, variation, on, what, has, been, traditionally, a, male, dominated, genre., This, conversion, of, Film, Noir, into, Femme, Noir, initiates, a, series, of, major, shifts, in, the, sexual, codes, of, the, genre, and, changes, the, traditional, image, of, the, femme, fatale, into, an, avenging, angel., The, illusion, of, feminine, vulnerability, is, one, of, the, central, themes, of, Remember, My, Name., Throughout, the, film,, Geraldine, Chaplin's, waif-like, appearance, is, suggestive, of, physical, and, psychological, fragility., She, displays,, however,, an, iron-will, and, a, sense, of, determination, which, is, symbolized, by, her, peculiar, habit, of, stamping, out, her, cigarettes, in, the, palm, of, her, hand., Several, of, the, men, in, Remember, My, Name, act, on, the, mistaken, assumption, that, they, are, either, protecting, her, or, manipulating, her., Behind, her, doe-like, eyes,, however,, Chaplin, has, a, strength, and, a, sense, of, personal, justice, that, gives, her, control, over, the, men, around, her., Rudolph's, mentor, is, filmmaker, Robert, Altman., Though, Altman, is, today, a, virtual, nonperson, in, Hollywood,, during, the, 1970s, he, directed, some, of, the, finest, films, of, the, period,, including, M*A*S*H, (USA, 1970),, McCabe, and, Mrs., Miller, (USA, 1971),, Thieves, Like, Us, (USA, 1973),, and, Nashville, (USA, 1975)., Subsequently,, many, of, Altman's, films, were, revisionist, critiques, of, Hollywood, conventions, and, established, genres., With, his, production, of, The, Long, Goodbye, (USA, 1973),, Altman, entered, into, a, problematic, debate, with, the, noir, genre, and, the, near-mythic, stature, of, one, of, the, genre's, most, important, fictional, figures,, Philip, Marlowe., In, the, novels, by, Raymond, Chandler, and, the, films, adapted, from, them, --, including, The, Big, Sleep,, Farewell,, My, Lovely,, and, Lady, in, the, Lake, --, Philip, Marlowe, has, come, to, represent, the, archetypal, private, eye,, a, tattered, and, worn, gumshoe, whose, verbal, flippancy, masks, a, surprisingly, chivalrous, code, of, honor., In, the, film, The, Long, Goodbye,, however,, Altman, views, Marlowe, as, an, anachronism, of, the, 1930s;, an, honorable, man, adrift, within, an, uncaring, and, amoral, culture., When, Marlowe, awakens, at, the, beginning, of, the, film,, he, is, like, a, modern, Rip, Van, Winkle, who, finds, that, the, world, as, he, knew, it, has, irrevocably, changed., Though, Altman, views, both, Marlowe, and, his, moral, code, with, nostalgic, sympathy,, he, also, realizes, the, degree, to, which, modern, society, has, turned, cold, and, decadent., In, making, The, Long, Goodbye,, Altman, presents, and, shares, in, Marlowe's, genuine, sense, of, disenchantment., Posted, by, Dennis, Toth, at, 1:17, PM, No, comments:, Labels:, Alan_Rudolph,, Film_Noir,, John_Boorman,, Robert_Altman, Sembene:, The, African, Screen, "We, must, understand, our, traditions, before, we, can, hope, to, understand, ourselves.", --Ousmane, Sembene, Though, the, typical, American, film, goer, is, largely, unfamiliar, with, the, African, (and, especially, the, country, of, Senegal)cinema,, nonetheless, the, name, of, Ousmane, Sembene, has, emerged, to, great, critical, prominence, on, the, international, screen., As, the, leading, filmmaker, of, the, surprisingly, active, Senegalese, cinema,, Sembene, has, created, a, body, of, works, that, artistically, probes, the, historic, and, contemporary, problems, of, Africa., In, the, process,, his, films, has, given, an, expressive, voice, to, the, thoughts, and, feelings, of, his, fellow, countrymen, and, Africans., Sembene, was, born, in, 1923, in, the, village, of, Ziguinchor, in, southern, Senegal., At, an, early, age, he, choice, not, to, follow, in, his, father's, profession, as, a, fisherman., Instead,, he, drifted, through, a, series, of, jobs, as, a, mechanic,, a, mason,, and, a, sharpshooter, in, the, French, army, during, World, War, Two., By, 1948,, he, had, traveled, from, Senegal, to, France, where, he, worked, as, a, longshoreman, in, Marseilles, and, became, a, militant, union, organizer., It, was, also, during, this, time, that, Sembene, began, to, write, poems, and, stories., His, first, novel,, Le, Docker, Noir,, was, published, in, 1956, and, earned, critical, praise, in, both, Africa, and, Europe., With, such, other, novels, as, Xala,, Les, Bouts, de, Bois, de, Dieu,, and, Dombaye,, Sembene, established, himself, as, a, major, writer., By, 1961,, Sembene, had, become, increasingly, interested, in, film, making, and, he, received, a, grant, to, study, at, the, Moscow, Film, Institute, under, the, Soviet, director, Mark, Donskoi., When, he, returned, to, Senegal,, Sembene, began, working, on, a, series, of, short, films, and,, in, 1965,, made, his, first, feature, with, the, production, of, Black, Girl., The, films, in, this, program, represent, two, specific, aspects, of, Sembene's, concerns., The, October, 10, presentation, of, Ceddo, (1977), is, a, major, example, of, Sembene's, interest, in, critically, reconstructing, the, events, and, issues, of, Senegalese, history., The, word, "ceddo", refers, to, the, common, village, people, who, live, under, the, feudalistic, system, presented, in, the, film., While, the, power, struggles, and, revolutions, of, the, film, are, motivated, by, the, political, desires, of, the, various, tribal, and, religious, leaders, of, the, film,, it, is, the, "ceddo", who, are, presented, by, Sembene, as, the, heroes, and, victims, of, historic, events., The, October, 17, screening, of, Xala, (1974), presents, Sembene's, caustic, view, of, modern, Africa, and, the, problems, of, the, independent, African, state., The, main, character, of, Xala, is, a, successful, African, businessman, who,, despite, his, talk, of, African, heritage, and, identity,, speaks, in, French, instead, of, his, native, language,, drinks, only, bottled, water, from, Europe,, and, can't, live, without, the, air, conditioner., Then, he, is, struck, by, the, "xala,", a, curse, of, impotence, which, sends, him, on, a, panic-ridden, search, of, doctors,, soothsayers,, and, shamans,, a, journey, which, forces, him, to, face, his, own, identity., Sembene's, unrelenting, attack, upon, hypocrisy, and, self-deceit, has, made, Xala, one, of, his, most, controversial, films., The, film, Emitai, (1971),, to, be, shown, on, October, 31,, invokes, recent, African, history, and, tribal, mythology, and, religion., The, film, is, set, during, the, final, days, of, World, War, Two, and, describes, the, clash, which, took, place, between, the, French, army, and, the, Diolas, tribe, in, the, Casamance, region, of, Senegal., The, word, "Emitai", is, the, name, for, the, god, of, thunder, in, the, religion, of, the, Diolas, people, and, the, unique, relationship, between, these, people, and, their, gods, is, one, of, the, major, themes, of, the, film., For, the, Diolas,, the, gods, and, spirits, are, real, and, Sembene, attempts, to, capture, in, Emitai, the, unique, sense, of, reality, as, it, is, felt, and, seen, by, these, people., The, 1968, film, Mandabi, concludes, the, series, on, November, 7., In, Mandabi, (translation:, the, money, order),, Sembene, creates, a, poignant, satire, in, which, he, details, the, bizarre, clashes, which, exists, between, the, influences, of, European, culture, and, ancient, African, customs., The, film's, main, character, quickly, discovers, that, the, simple, task, of, cashing, a, money, order, can,, and, does,, become, a, major, point, of, conflict, between, Third, World, bureaucracy, and, the, surviving, structures, of, European, colonization., Mandabi, also, becomes,, for, Sembene,, a, study, of, the, vices, and, virtues, of, the, common, people, of, Africa., Sembene, is, sharp, and, bitter, in, his, attacks, on, the, deceptions, used, by, many, of, the, characters, in, Mandabi., In, turn,, he, finds, in, his, hero, an, ultimate, expression, of, traditional, virtue., Posted, by, Dennis, Toth, at, 12:48, PM, No, comments:, Labels:,
