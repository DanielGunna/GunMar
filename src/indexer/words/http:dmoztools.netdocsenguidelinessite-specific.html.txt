Sites, Non-English, Sites, Sites, Requiring, a, Password, Below, are, guidelines, that, directly, relate, to, adding, specific, types, of, sites., These, guidelines, will, help, ensure, that, material, added, to, the, directory, meets, the, directory's, goals., Adult, Sites, The, Adult, category, is, designed, for, sites, that, present, sexually, explicit, material, in, a, manner, that, is, inappropriate, for, children., It's, a, unique, category,, as, it, is, not, accessible, from, the, front, page, of, DMOZ,, and, every, page, in, the, Adult, hierarchy, is, labeled, with, a, PICS, tag, to, prevent, appropriately, configured, browsers, from, accessing, these, links., The, Adult, category, primarily, (but, not, exclusively), contains, a, variety, of, erotica, as, well, as, sites, which, show,, describe,, or, advertise, explicit, sex, or, sexual, nudity, with, the, intent, to, arouse,, rather, than, solely, inform, or, educate., See, the, official, Adult, Guidelines, and, the, Adult, FAQ, for, more, details, regarding, adult, content., The, Adult, vs., Other, Categories, section, of, the, Adult, Guidelines, explains, the, distinction, between, adult, listings, and, other, areas, of, the, directory., Kids, and, Teens, Sites, The, Kids, and, Teens, category, is, an, entirely, separate, directory, with, its, own, community, structure, and, guidelines., Sites, that, appeal, to, people, under, the, age, of, 18, may, be, listed, in, both, directories., Deeplinking, URLs, Deeplinking, is, the, process, of, adding, links, to, sub-pages, and, sub-domains, within, a, site., General, Rule:, In, the, vast, majority, of, categories, and, branches,, deeplinking, is, the, exception, rather, than, the, rule., Deeplinks, should, offer, content, that, is, unique, and, extremely, useful, to, a, particular, category., There, are, no, strict, rules, regarding, the, type, of, site, that, should, or, should, not, be, deeplinked., Providing, deeplinks,, in, a, uniform, way,, to, sites, that, offer, extremely, useful, and, unique, content, can, add, value, to, the, directory, in, a, few, cases, (e.g., categories, with, very, limited, content,, and, where, the, meat, of, the, available, web, content, is, typically, buried, within, larger, sites)., However,, editors, should, be, very, judicious, when, adding, deeplinks, of, a, particular, URL., If, you, are, uncertain, about, adding, deeplinks,, ask, an, experienced, editor,, such, as, a, meta, or, an, editall,, for, advice, or, guidance., Ultimately,, all, deeplinking, decisions, are, subject, to, admin, approval., For, additional, guidance, on, deeplinking,, see, this, article, from, the, May, 2001, issue, of, the, DMOZ, newsletter., Multiple, Listings, of, an, URL, Most, sites, will, fit, perfectly, into, one, category., DMOZ, categories, are, specialized, enough, so, that, in, most, cases, you, should, not, list, a, site, more, than, once., If, a, site, offers, many, different, things,, it, should, be, listed, in, a, more, general, category, as, opposed, to, listing, it, many, specialized, subcategories., A, site, must, be, directly, relevant, to, the, scope, of, the, category, in, which, you, are, listing, a, site., Consult, category, charters, to, determine, a, category's, topical, scope., For, example,, if, you, have, a, site, on, US, History, covering, the, American, Revolution,, the, Civil, War,, and, the, Presidents,, you, should, not, list, it, in, each, one, of, those, subcategories,, but, rather, list, it, in, a, general, category, such, as, Society:, History:, By, Region:, North, America:, United, States., There, are, a, few, occasions, in, which, a, site, could, be, listed, in, more, than, one, category., Sites, that, are, relevant, to, a, subject, category, and, a, specific, local, geographic, area., Many, sites, can, be, listed, once, in, a, topical, branch, of, the, directory,, and, once, in, the, Regional, category., Sites, aimed, at, people, under, 18, years, of, age, may, be, listed, once, in, the, Kids, and, Teens, Directory,, and, once, in, another, topical, area, of, the, main, directory., Sites, that, have, true, research, value, and/or, cover, a, number, of, different, subjects, across, the, directory, to, such, a, degree, that, one, category, isn't, sufficient, in, describing, the, site's, contents., However,, multiple, listings, should, be, the, exception,, not, the, rule., Editors, should, never, delete, a, listing, from, a, topical, category, simply, because, it, is, already, listed, in, Regional., Likewise,, editors, should, not, delete, listings, from, the, main, section, of, the, directory, because, they, also, appear, in, Kids_and_Teens., Non-English, Sites, Sites, in, languages, other, than, English, should, be, listed, in, the, most, precise, equivalent, category, under, World/<language>., A, non-English, listing, in, a, category, outside, of, World, should, be, moved, to, the, appropriate, World, category., For, example,, a, Spanish, language, site, in, the, Arts:, Music:, Bands, and, Artists, Unreviewed, category, should, be, forwarded, to, the, World:, Español:, Artes:, Música:, Bandas, y, artistas, Unreviewed, category., If, you, can't, determine, which, category, a, site, should, be, sent, to,, you, can, send, it, to, the, appropriate, top, World/(Language), Unreviewed, category, with, an, entry, in, the, editor, note, field, notifying, the, World, editors, of, the, move., Links, between, equivalent, categories, in, different, languages, are, managed, using, language, groups., All, categories, within, a, language, group, will, link, to, each, other,, using, the, name, of, the, language, as, the, link, text., To, create, a, language, group, or, add, a, category, to, an, existing, language, group,, click, on, the, "add, to, language, group", link, on, the, category, edit, page, and, enter, an, equivalent, category, on, the, following, page., Other-language, links, will, appear, on, both, the, category's, edit, and, public, category, pages., Multilingual, Sites, If, a, site's, content, is, available, in, more, than, one, language,, the, site, may, be, listed, in, more, than, one, language, category., For, example,, if, a, site, is, in, English,, German,, and, French,, the, site, may, be, listed, in, an, English-only, category,, World/Deutsch,, and, World/Français., When, listing, a, multilingual, site,, list, the, URL, for, the, "doorway", page, that, provides, links, to, all, the, language, editions;, OR, list, the, language-specific, URL, only, if, the, doorway, links, to, the, individual, language, editions, are, not, obvious., http://www.service-public.fr/, resolves, to, a, page, written, in, French., On, the, upper, right, hand, corner, there, is, a, link, to, the, English, version:, http://www.service-public.fr/langue/english/, http://www.service-public.fr/may, be, added, to, the, appropriate, category, World/Français, and, to, the, appropriate, category, in, the, English-only, part, of, the, directory, (e.g., Regional:, Europe:, France:, Government)., Sites, Requiring, a, Password, All, sites, must, be, reviewed, before, they, are, listed, and, those, that, require, a, password, are, no, exception., You, may, wish, to, contact, the, site's, owner, for, a, password,, explaining, that, without, one,, the, site, will, not, be, listed., Some, Adult, sites, use, an, Adult, Verification, Service, to, control, access., If, you, come, across, such, a, site,, then, please, contact, one, of, the, top-level, Adult, editors,, or, a, meta, editor,, for, help, on, how, to, deal, with, it., Any, password, you, get, for, reviewing, a, site,, be, that, from, a, higher, level, editor, or, directly, from, the, submitter,, should, be, kept, confidential,, not, listed, in, the, editor, notes,, and, in, any, case, never, disclosed, outside, the, DMOZ, community., Misuses, of, a, password, entrusted, to, you, for, the, purpose, of, review, may, result, in, removal, of, your, editing, privileges., Last, update:, Wed, Dec, 28, 14:05, EST, 2016, Copyright, ©, 2016, AOL, Inc., (Terms, of,
