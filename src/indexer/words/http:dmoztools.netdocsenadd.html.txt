highly, selective., We, don't, accept, all, sites,, so, please, don't, take, it, personally, should, a, site, not, be, accepted., Our, goal, is, to, make, the, directory, as, useful, as, possible, for, our, users,, not, to, have, the, directory, include, all, (or, even, most), of, the, sites, that, could, possibly, be, listed, or, serve, as, a, promotional, tool, for, the, entities, listed.,
