Andrew, Wickliffe, Leave, a, comment, Shin, Godzilla, is, the, story, of, hard-working, bureaucrats, responding, successfully, to, a, national, crisis., When, the, giant, monsters, invade,, you, can’t, do, better, than, the, able, public, servants, of, Shin, Godzilla., And, for, most, of, the, film,, directors, Higuchi, and, Anno, pull, it, off., The, first, act, of, the, film,, with, the, introduction, of, the, unlikely, new, Godzilla,, races–Anno, edits, with, Sato, Atsuki, and, they, don’t, slow, down, until, it’s, time, for, a, full, stop., There’s, a, lot, of, humor, to, Shin, Godzilla,, but, it’s, entirely, for, the, viewer., The, characters, don’t, get, a, break, or, a, laugh, or, even, regular, smiling., They, stoically, battle, the, apocalypse,, whether, it’s, a, giant, monster, or, the, U.S., government, externally, unwanted, pressure, on, Japan., Shin, Godzilla, avoids, politics., Way, too, much., But, it, does, have, this, steady, mistrust, of, the, United, States., It’s, too, bad, too,, because, the, U.S., shows, up, in, the, second, act, with, all, sorts, of, Godzilla, info, and, those, information, dumps, are, a, mess., On, one, hand,, Anno, doesn’t, want, to, take, the, kaiju, thing, too, seriously., He, knows, he’s, got, disbelief, suspended, by, this, time,, so, why, not, rush, through, some, really, silly, origin, stuff., There’s, a, portents, to, Shin, Godzilla,, which, the, directors, pull, off, (thanks, to, the, actors,, thanks, to, the, editing),, but, Anno, doesn’t, have, a, sense, of, humor, about, it., After, the, almost, goofy, first, act–which, transitions, masterfully, into, the, second, act, through, montage–it, seems, like, Shin, is, going, to, be, something, special., Except, it, never, gets, there., For, two, hours,, the, movie, keeps, promising, something, more, in, a, few, minutes,, delivering, an, almost, perfect, moment, here, and, there,, but, always, dragging, it, out., The, second, act, is, lead, Hasegawa, Hiroki, dragging, the, cast, of, hundreds, through, the, clumsy, introduction, of, new, ideas,, new, mutations,, new, characters., Shin, Godzilla, has, a, hundred, speaking, parts., Maybe., It, has, a, lot., It’s, this, rapid, fire, political, thriller, thing,, only, instead, of, a, nuclear, war,, they’re, fighting, this, giant, monster., Every, once, in, a, while,, there’s, a, “Godzilla, moment”, with, the, giant, monster, and, the, film, seems, to, be, moving, more, towards, something, to, do, with, Godzilla, symbolically., Even, self-referentially., Anno, and, Higuchi, use, some, classic, Godzilla, music,, but, they, don’t, do, much, else, referential., The, locations,, sure,, but, it’s, supposed, to, be, scary., Godzilla’s, supposed, to, be, dangerous., And, Godzilla, does, do, some, serious, damage,, which, the, film, completely, ignores, in, terms, of, human, casualties., There’s, maybe, one, tragic, scene,, early, on,, when, it, seems, like, Shin, Godzilla, still, might, go, somewhere, else–into, the, cellphone, footage,, into, the, lives, of, the, displaced–but, then, it, doesn’t., Instead,, the, film, introduces, Ishihara, Satomi., Ishihara, is, the, half-Japanese,, half-white, American, daughter, of, a, U.S., senator, who’s, on, her, way, up, the, ladder, in, Washington., She’s, also, a, bit, of, a, party, girl,, because, she’s, rich., Ishihara, does, okay, with, some, of, the, part., She’s, bad, at, the, English, deliveries,, which, immediately, kills, the, cinema, verite, the, directors, try, to, keep, going., She’s, got, too, much, character, for, the, movie, and, nothing, to, do, with, it., If, Ishihara, were, better,, the, character, not, be, such, a, drag., But, Ishihara’s, just, fine,, not, phenomenal., Again,, she, gets, no, help, from, the, directors., Maybe, one, of, them, told, her, to, play, flirty, with, Hasegawa, and, the, other, said, not, to, play, flirty, with, him., As, for, Hasegawa,, he’s, a, great, lead., His, character, is, a, young,, bright,, impetuous, staffer, who, just, wants, to, do, good., He, wants, to, be, Justin, Trudeau., Ishihara, wants, to, be, Hillary., Except, to, change, political, analogies,, Ishihara’s, character, is, more, the, Mandy, Hampton, part., Everyone, else, is, great, because, they, aren’t, in, it, too, much., If, the, performance, is, broad,, the, actor, is, gone, pretty, soon., By, the, time, they’re, back,, they’re, now, a, familiar, face, and, they’re, welcome., It, perpetuates., It’s, a, very, well, made, film., Until, the, third, act,, at, least., The, sludge, second, act, seems, like, it’s, building,, through, monotony, maybe,, but, definitely, intensifying., Because, it’s, so, well-made., Then, it, collapses, and, Shin, Godzilla, just, gets, heavier, and, heavier., Anno,, in, the, script,, tries, to, keep, it, light., He, tries, to, play, up, the, characters, as, familiar, to, the, audience,, but, the, film’s, lost, its, teeth., If, you’re, going, to, deus, ex, machina,, put, it, in, the, right, spot, and, don’t, try, to, drag, it, out, two, weeks, in, the, present, action., Because, the, directors, break, Shin, Godzilla., For, a, better, part, of, its, runtime,, it, could’ve, gone, somewhere., But, Anno, and, Higuchi, don’t, want, to, take, it, anywhere., Except, as, a, politician, positivity, message., ★★, CREDITS,

Takenouchi, 2016,, ★★★½,, Documentary, 13th, (2016,, Ava, DuVernay), 3, April, 2017, Andrew, Wickliffe, Leave, a, comment, The, first, half, of, 13th, is, didactic–well,, except, when, the, film, makes, fun, of, interviewee, Grover, Norquist., There, are, three, or, four, capital, C, Conservatives, interviewees;, Norquist, and, Gingrich, are, present, because, they’re, such, trolls, they, think, they’re, convincing., Gingrich, is, during, his, Black, Lives, Matter, phase, (the, documentary, is, pre–2016, election,, but, still, very, 2016,, which, I, need, to, talk, about),, but, Norquist, is, just, a, chump., Everyone, knows, it, and, the, film, embraces, it,, maybe, the, only, time, 13th, lets, you, have, the, hint, of, a, smile., Getting, it, out, of, the, way,, the, other, Conservative, interviewees, are, just, unknown, chumps., Or, worms., The, sad, part, of, reality, is, director, DuVernay, isn’t, hunting, down, worms, or, chumps, for, these, interviews, (except, Norquist, and, Gingrich,, though,, again,, Gingrich, seems, to, be, present, with, a, different,, pre-Trump, agenda);, they’re, just, the, right, guys, to, be, interviewed., Evil, organizations, out, to, ruin, the, United, States, are, actually, staffed, with, the, Conservative, geek, out, of, a, late, nineties, teen, movie., Norquist, being, more, in, line, with, what, happens, with, a, John, Hughes, bro, grows, up., Anyway., I, think, I, have, that, fervor, out., The, first, half, of, 13th, is, extremely, didactic., DuVernay, is, guiding, the, film, through, a, certain, number, of, interviewees,, through, a, certain, bit, of, history., She’s, also, making, an, argument–the, 13th, amendment, to, the, Constitution, has, been, used, through, white, supremacy, to, fuck, up, the, lives, of, people, of, color,, specifically, Black, people., And,, you, know,, she’s, right., She, wins, that, argument, the, second, Angela, Davis, comes, back, as, an, interviewee, after, being, shown, in, historical, footage., DuVernay, doesn’t, introduce, Davis, as, a, former, firebrand,, she’s, a, professor., Even, if, you, know, Angela, Davis,, she, goes, from, being, this, beauteously, interviewed, academic, to, someone, who, outsmarted, some, significant, bad, guys, of, history, in, this, raw, historical, footage., DuVernay, does, a, lot, with, historical, footage,, whether, it’s, from, the, teens,, fifties,, sixties,, eighties,, nineties., It’s, one, of, 13th’s, few, sticking, points., The, footage, isn’t, up-converted, correctly., Or, it, is, and, DuVernay, is, obscuring, history, and, making, memory, this, permeable, thing,, but, I, think, it’s, just, not, up-converted, well, enough., So, that, first, half, is, didactic., It’s, a, history, lesson., It’s, a, thesis, statement,, it’s, a, persuasive, essay., DuVernay, covers, 149, years, of, history,, with, more, and, more, focus, on, the, last, fifty, years, as, the, film, progresses., It, has, a, natural, narrative, flow, and, then, it, stops, in, 2012., And, DuVernay, tells, the, audience, to, now, apply, that, history, to, what’s, going, on, right, now., Starting, with, Trayvon, Martin,, continuing, into, Black, Lives, Matter,, finishing, with, Trump., Now,, 13th, is, pre-election,, another, of, its, sticking, points., Certain, aspects, of, it, feel, a, tad, ephemeral., That, first, half, is, a, lot, of, historical, fact., Learning, history,, even, critically, thinking, about, that, history, as, it, affects, modernity,, it’s, ephemeral., Film, viewing, is, an, ephemeral, act., But, since, DuVernay’s, already, proved, the, thesis,, before, getting, to, the, present, day,, what’s, 13th, doing, now?, It’s, no, longer, a, persuasive, documentary, or, a, didactic, one., It, doesn’t, have, a, narrative., Or,, is, DuVernay’s, narrative, distance, such, the, narrative, is, the, viewer’s., 13th, is, an, excellent, documentary, for, the, first, ninety, percent., I, even, enjoyed, the, camera, manipulation, in, the, interview, after, a, certain, point., 13th’s, very, accessible;, DuVernay, is, looking, at, the, impossibly, grim,, but, she, keeps, it, accessible., With, profile, interview, shots, for, emphasis., It’s, fine., But, then, in, the, last, ten, minutes, or, so,, DuVernay, brings, 13th, into, reality., Immediate,, clear,, HD, reality., Everything, comes, together., Not, just, all, the, subjects,, but, the, visual, style, of, the, infographics., DuVernay’s, the, first, person, I’ve, ever, seen, the, use, infographics, so, starkly., It’s, almost, a, rejection, of, the, effect., Fine, photography, from, Hans, Charles, and, Kira, Kelly., Editor,, co-producer,, and, co-writer, Spencer, Averick, is, best, at, the, writing, and, producing., Even, if, the, cuts, to, profile, weren’t, his, idea,, they’re, inappropriately, jarring., There’s, no, nuance, to, the, cuts–good, guys, and, bad, get, the, same, cutting., It’s, off-putting., Editing, is, very, important., Nicely,, DuVernay, doesn’t, use, that, device, much, in, the, second, half, so, it’s, win-win., She, does, quite, a, bit, with, the, documentary, medium, to, get, the, film, right., 13th, is, outstanding., ★★★½, CREDITS, Directed, by, Ava, DuVernay;, written, by, DuVernay, and, Spencer, Averick;, directors, of, photography,, Hans, Charles, and, Kira, Kelly;, edited, by, Averick;, music,

Rhapsody., It’s, literal,, so, Jeff, Schine, is, actually, running, around, telling, his, mother, things, and, shooting, people, and, whatever., Except, he, doesn’t, shoot, the, guy, right., Because, a, lot, of, Literal, is, just, stock, footage., It, might, work, better, as, an, actual, commercial, for, the, stock, footage, place,, actually., As, its, own, adaptation, of, the, song,, it’s, severely, lacking., There’s, creative, enthusiasm, from, directors, Gorski, and, Pueringer,, but, it’s, simultaneously, truncated, and, stuck., Everything, in, Literal, is, about, the, gimmick., So, it, doesn’t, matter, if, Schine, and, Deborah, Ramaglia, (playing,, you, know,, “Mama”), aren’t, good., Though, Ramaglia, is, fine., Schine, isn’t,, but, who, knows, if, it’s, his, fault, or, it’s, just, because, it’s, a, cute,, bad, idea., Once, Gorski, and, Pueringer, reveal, the, second, setting,, it’s, all, kind, of, pointless., Sure,, they, can, do, it., So, what., If, it, were, part, of,

(1973,, Norman, Jewison), 1, April, 2017, Andrew, Wickliffe, Leave, a, comment, There’s, a, lot, bad, about, Jesus, Christ, Superstar., Some, of, it, is, casting,, a, lot, of, it, is, Jewison’s, direction, choices., He’s, clearly, thrilled, to, be, shooting, in, the, Middle, East,, but, it, doesn’t, connect, to, his, actual, narrative., It, connects, to, the, subject, matter,, just, not, the, film, Jewison, ends, up, making., The, one, where, there’s, little, or, no, connective, tissue, between, scenes, and, where, Jewison, can’t, figure, out, where, to, have, his, actors, look, while, they’re, singing., It’s, kind, of, important, in, a, musical, and, sometimes, they, look, to, the, sky–occasionally, even, when, it’s, appropriate–other, times, they, look, directly, into, the, camera., Or,, a, lot, of, the, time,, Jewison, never, shows, them, singing, at, all., Instead,, the, music, of, Jesus, Christ, Superstar, is, a, soundtrack, to, their, otherwise, silent, lives., Very, silent., There’s, maybe, a, baaa, from, one, of, the, symbolic, sheep., It, gets, to, be, a, real, problem, in, the, second, half,, when, a, crowd, is, chasing, Jesus, (a, very, blond,, Robin, Hood-goateed, Ted, Neeley), and, it’s, clear, there, ought, to, be, ambient, noise., Of, course,, the, movie’s, jumped, into, the, deep, end, by, that, time, so, it, doesn’t, really, matter., The, film’s, first, act, is, the, strongest,, even, if, Jewison, can’t, figure, out, how, to, direct, Carl, Anderson’s, scenes., Anderson, plays, Judas,, who, gets, the, opening, number., Jewison’s, solution, is, to, make, Anderson, tiny,, letting, the, scenery, overpower., It, takes, Jewison, until, the, second, act, to, get, comfortable, showing, his, actors, actually, singing., With, Anderson, it, works., Anderson, acts, while, singing., Yvonne, Elliman, is, phenomenal, at, it,, even, when, Jewison, edits, her, songs, horribly., Neeley’s, not, so, good., He’s, a, stone-faced, Jesus., Though, still, somewhat, likable., During, the, second, act,, anyway., In, the, third, act,, when, he’s, just, a, prisoner,, there’s, so, much, other, bad, stuff, going, on,, there’s, no, point, in, keeping, track, of, Neeley., The, bad, stuff, in, the, third, act, are, Barry, Dennen, and, Josh, Mostel., Dennen’s, bad., Some, of, it, is, Jewison’s, direction, of, the, scene., Some, of, it, isn’t., Mostel, is, just, plain, horrible., The, scene’s, terribly, directed, and, probably, should, be, offensive, if, Jewison, weren’t, just, so, lame, at, it, and, Mostel, is, horrible., If, the, film, has, any, good, will, left, at, that, point,, Mostel, burns, it, up., Dennen, might, be, tolerable, without, him., Though, the, looping, is, atrocious, on, Dennen’s, song., Decent, singing, and, performance, from, Bob, Bingham., Not, from, Kurt, Yaghjian., Neeley’s, got, a, fine, voice., He, can’t, act, but, he’s, got, a, fine, voice., And, it’s, not, like, if, he, could, act,, the, movie, would, be, much, better., Jewison’s, got, a, lot, of, bad, ideas,, for, symbolism,, for, narrative,, for, composition., Good, photography, from, Douglas, Slocombe., Able, if, terribly, conceptualized, editing, from, Antony, Gibbs–except, when, he’s, cutting, between, Anderson’s, final, number, and, Neeley’s, walk, to, Golgotha,, that, sequence, is, awesomely, cut., Kind, of, lame, as, far, as, the, cruxifiction, scene, plays, out–Jewison, lets, his, pretense, run, loose, and, it, fails, the, promise, of, Anderson’s, finale–but, that, editing, is, excellent., Jewison, just, does, a, bad, job,
