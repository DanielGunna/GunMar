[Click, here, for, updated, Epilogue., 9/3/2011, Script, for, my, Wedding, in, Sauk, Village, Sketch., This, simple, webpage, is, a, diary, of, my, experience, completing, the, Second, City, Training, Center's, Writing, Program., It, will, chronicle, our, writing, class, putting, up, a, 75, minute, sketch, comedy, show, at, Donny's, Skybox, Theater, in, Pipers, Alley, in, Chicago., I, hope, to, add, more, pictures, and, graphics, in, the, coming, days., How, did, we, get, here?, Our, group, of, comedy, writers, started, back, on, January, 5,, 2000, at, The, Second, City, Training, Center., We, were, a, group, of, 18, people, who, came, together, to, breathe, life, into, our, comedy, writing, ambitions., Our, instruction, would, consist, of, 6, levels, of, classes,, each, 8, weeks, in, length., We, would, learn, the, basic, comic, premises,, some, theatre, history,, mix, in, viewing, some, sketch, comedy, videos, -, and, a, lot, of, writing., In, level, 5, we, would, create, a, show, and, put, our, best, material, in, a, sketch, comedy, revue., Level, 6, we, learn, the, business, of, becoming, a, working,, paid, writer, and, create, our, writing, portfolio., What, do, you, do, in, a, comedy, writing, class?, "Ok, kids,, here, is, how, to, write, funny, material., First...", Sorry, it's, not, like, that., What, was, the, first, thing, you, had, to, write, that, first, meeting?, We, were, given, twenty, minutes, to, write, about, a, mugging, at, the, airport., No, guidance, as, to, the, format,, or, characters,, or, story, -, nothing., Just, write., Didn't, have, to, be, funny,, just, write., Ok,, pencils, down., We, had, our, twenty, minutes., Now, what?, Our, instructor,, a, fine, teacher, and, hell, of, a, writer, himself,, Glenn, Earich, asked, us, to, read, aloud, what, we, had, written., Read?, ALOUD?!, Good, God!, The, room, suddenly, was, 10, degrees, hotter., One-by-one, we, went, around, the, room., People, reading, their, first, official, comedy, piece., And, you, know, something?, It, wasn't, bad!, Some, people, had, funny, stuff., Many, pieces, were, exposition, with, no, dialogue., Some, short,, some, long., The, most, amazing, thing, was, how, many, different, angles, there, were, on, a, mugging, at, an, airport., No, two, were, alike., Lesson, one, -, you, can, make, completely, different, scenes, from, the, same, basic, premise., Homework, assignment, one, from, that, class, was, to, turn, our, in-class, writing, into, a, scene, with, dialogue., We, were, on, our, way., As, the, weeks, passed, our, group, dwindled., For, whatever, reasons,, people, chose, not, to, continue, through, the, program., Was, it, the, constant, writing?, We, all, had, real, lives, outside, the, group,, yet, we, had, to, have, that, sketch, for, class, on, Wednesday, night., And, re-writes, too., After, four, months,, you, had, to, really, want, to, write, to, keep, going., We, had, to, submit, sketches, aftet, the, first, three, levels, for, review, to, be, accepted, to, the, next, level,, so, there, is, some, judging, of, our, writing, going, on, as, we, progress, through, the, program., The, class, jelled, together., We, soon, were, bringing, copies, of, our, sketches, and, passing, them, around, to, be, read, aloud, by, other, class, members., Our, writing, came, alive, in, other, voices., Very, different, comedy, styles, were, emerging., We, were, all, testing, and, stretching, our, comedic, points, of, view., Some, were, bad,, some, good, -, and, a, few, pieces, were, very, good., Onward, the, weeks, marched, by., The, class, would, get, smaller., We, were, now, meeting, in, a, room, with, no, windows,, poor, ventilation, and, served, as, storage, for, The, Second, City., Ahh, yes,, this, was, to, get, us, used, to, a, true, writing, environment, for, a, television, show., Our, fourth, level, we, were, down, to, seven, writers., In, this, level, we, wrote, few, new, sketches, and, did, many, re-writes, of, earlier, material., We, were, putting, together, our, best, stuff, for, our, level, 5, comedy, revue., A, Second, City, style, sketch, show, with, a, director,, piano, player,, lights, and, sound, technician, all, at, the, Skybox, theater., We, were, to, audition, the, actors/actresses, and, work, with, the, director, on, refining, our, material, to, create, this, show, -, written, by, our, group., The, director, is, in, control., He, picks, the, final, sketches,, makes, the, running, order,, has, the, final, word, on, cast, choices, and, generally, tolerates, the, writers., This, is, where, we, are, today, -, fifth, level, and, we, lost, one, more, writer., Our, writers, are;, Scott, Chafin, Mike, Hoffman, Joe, Kelly, Jerry, Krull, Julia, Svoboda, Alan, Taraszka, Our, director, is:, Josh, Funk, Our, head, writer:, Mary, Scruggs, October, 11,, 2000, The, first, meeting, of, the, level, 5, class, was, an, introduction, by, Kim, Clark,, head, of, the, writing, program, at, The, Second, City, Training, Center,, Rob, Chambers,, Director, of, the, Second, City, Training, Center., They, spoke, about, how, our, show, was, to, be, run, and, how, we, as, writers, should, prepare, and, interact, with, the, director, and, head, writer., They, spoke, of, how, theatre, in, Chicago, worked., Both, non-profit, and, for-profit, theater., Then, they, turned, us, over, to, Josh, and, Mary., We, learned, how, auditions, would, be, run, the, next, week., We, as, writers, would, man, the, check-in,, answer, questions,, and, usher, the, auditionees, in, and, out., We, were, to, keep, quiet, and, remain, in, back, during, auditions., We, were, to, laugh, at, the, appropriate, points,, even, if, it, was, forced,, to, help, ease, the, nervous, people, who, were, on, stage., Next, topic,, introduce, our, director, and, head, writer, to, our, material., Our, group,, ever, prepared,, had, put, together, a, book, of, what, we, considered, our, best, sketches., We, then, read, two, sketches, from, each, writer, to, give, our, director, and, head, writer, an, inkling, our, material., We, then, agreed, to, meet, a, half, hour, early, the, next, Wednesday, for, the, auditons., October, 18,, 2000, Auditions., Joe, Kelly, was, manning, a, small, table, outside, the, Skybox, theatre., Joe, was, good., He, had, been, in, a, previous, writer's, show, a, few, months, before, as, an, actor., As, actors, and, actresses, came, in,, Joe, would, hand, out, a, form, and, ask, for, acting, resumes, and, headshots., Yes, headshots., Even, our, little, show, was, going, to, consume, the, ever, expensive, head, shot, of, a, struggling, actor., Although, not, necessary,, the, head, shot, was, requested., It, helped, us, to, remember, the, actors, later., A, few, words, about, auditions., I, (Jerry, Krull), have, never, auditioned, for, a, stage, show, in, my, life., (Hint, -, take, my, opinions, here, with, the, proverbial, grain, of, salt), When, I, was, ninteen,, I, audtioned, for, two, different, theme, parks, as, a, singer., That, was, what, seems, like, a, lifetime, ago, and, it, did, not, leave, a, very, good, impression, with, me., I, completed, a, year-long, improvisation, program, through, The, Players, Workshop, of, the, Second, City, in, 1999., I, had, no, audition, there., Just, get, through, the, program, and, at, the, end,, your, group, writes, and, puts, up, a, sketch, revue, show., Side, note,, when, I, asked, my, wife, how, she, liked, my, performace, in, the, show,, she, suggested, I, try, writing, instead., Behind, every, great, man..., Back, to, the, audition., I, stayed, out, with, Joe, to, sign-in, the, first, and, second, group, of, auditionees., We, were, going, to, have, 10, people, audition, each, hour, from, 7:00, PM, to, 10:00, PM., Some, how, we, managed, to, get, 12, -, 15, people, each, hour., Our, director, Josh, also, directs, one, of, The, Second, City's, touring, companies., I, think, word, got, out, about, Josh, and, we, had, an, overflow, of, auditionees., Either, that, or, word, got, out, about, the, quality, of, material, from, our, group, -, hmm..., It, was, amazing, to, see, the, group, of, people, who, came, to, audition., I, recognized, a, few, from, other, shows, I, have, seen., There, were, some, people, who, were, outgoing, and, gregarious,, some, brooding, art, types,, a, couple, of, nervous,, wide-eyed, neophytes,, and, the, occasional, scary, looking, human., As, the, actors, waited, in, the, lobby,, we, handed, them, "sides", to, read., A, snippet, of, two, of, our, sketches., One, side,, by, Joe, Kelly,, was, a, two, person, sketch, with, a, man, and, woman., The, woman, part, had, a, long, speech, near, the, end., The, other, sketch,, by, Mike, Hoffman,, was, for, two, men, with, very, few, words, -, a, lot, of, back, and, forth,, three, and, four, word, sentences., The, folks, waiting, to, audition, were, reading, through, the, sides, trying, different, inflections, and, characterizations., Some, knew, each, other, and, worked, in, groups,, some, spoke, alone., The, occasional, question, came, forth, -, "will, we, do, any, improvisation?", A, quick, check, with, Josh, -, yes, there, will, be, improv., I, was, able, to, watch, the, second, and, third, group, audition., Josh, would, explain, a, little, bit, about, the, show., Explain, how, we,, as, writers,, had, written, sketches, and, they, were, auditioning, to, be, part, of, the, cast., Rehearsals, would, be, Wednesday, nights, from, 7:00, to, 10:00, and, performances, were, scheduled, for, Fridays, December, 1,, 8, &, 15th, at, 8:00, PM, in, the, Skybox, theater, (where, the, auditions, were, taking, place)., Each, group, was, split, in, two, and, then, the, first, group, was, lined, up, on, stage, ready, for, the, audition., Josh, started, them, out, with, 30, second, improvs., Josh, would, shout, a, location, and, the, group, on, stage, would, then, have, 2, people, jump, forward, and, start, a, scene, based, on, that, location., He, explained, he, would, be, looking, for, good, characters, from, the, people., Nerve-wracking, for, the, actor!, You, have, no, idea, who, will, jump, out, with, you, or, what, they, are, going, to, say, or, do., All, you, know, is, the, location, you, both, are, in., But, you, better, jump, out, and, do, a, scene., Some, were, very, good, and, funny,, some, were, awful, and, went, nowhere,, but, the, group, kept, right, on, trying., I, had, been, through, this, with, my, improv, class., You, really, have, to, listen, and, work, with, your, partner., You, have, to, understand, their, character., Don't, deny!, If, your, partner, says, "Look, at, this, delicious, vat, of, pudding", as, they, mime, taking, a, handful, and, shoving, it, in, their, mouth,, don't, deny, them, and, say, "That's, not, pudding,, it's, shit!", No,, no, no!, You, are, going, for, a, laugh, at, the, expense, of, your, castmate, -, not, a, good, thing, for, an, audition., But, the, key, was, given, to, them, in, the, beginning., Josh, said, he, would, be, looking, for, good, characters., Don't, be, the, same, character, in, each, 30, second, improv., And, please,, be, a, character., You, may, only, get, to, jump, out, 2, or, 3, times., Be, someone, different, each, time, and, show, a, little, stage, presence, -, move, around,, mime, actions, doing, something., When, it, came, time, for, reading, the, sides,, we, writers, had, to, act, just, like, the, actors., We, were, about, to, hear, the, same, two, scenes, about, 20, times, each., We, had, already, stopped, laughing, at, the, scenes, in, class, since, we, read, them, after, each, re-write., Now, we, had, nervous, actors, who, needed, to, hear, laughter., Some, made, it, easy,, they, grasped, a, character, and, added, that, magical, acting, touch, to, written, words., Laughs, came, freely, and, naturally., For, others, we, had, to, force, a, laugh, a, little, to, give, them, feedback., Others,, well,, I, swear, I, saw, Joe, about, to, cry, a, couple, of, times, because, his, words,, his, sparkling,, crackling, words, had, been, butchered, on, stage., Just, part, of, being, a, writer, I, guess., One, final, comment, for, people, audtioning, for, a, comedy, sketch, show., Remember, it, is, comedy, -, this, is, not, the, time, to, show, the, director, your, dramatic, acting, skills., If, you, can't, get, a, feel, for, the, material, -, should, this, be, read, fast,, or, deadpan,, or, what, -, choose, one,, just, don't, choose, straight, drama., By, the, end, of, the, night, we, had, our, cast., Josh, let, us, know, who, he, had, chosen, and, we, were, told, which, sketches, of, ours, were, currently, being, considered., Each, writer, had, two, sketches., Mary, gave, us, a, few, words, about, re-writes, and, told, us, to, do, any, re-writes, we, had, in, mind, and, bring, enough, copies, for, the, whole, cast, next, Wednesday., We, writers, had, a, little, discussion, outside, under, the, movie, marquee, at, Pipers, Alley, that, night, -, and, I, would, say, we, are, all, psyched., We, like, the, cast,, the, director, and, the, head, writer., I, just, hope, my, material, holds, up., Our, Cast:, Allison, Bills, K8, Gallagher, ("K8", is, how, she, spells, it!), Emily, Skyle, Marz, Timms, Adam, Voss, Jim, Woods, October, 25,, 2000, This, was, the, night, we, met, the, cast, and, they, had, their, first, exposure, to, our, written, material., Josh, welcomed, the, cast, and, laid, out, the, rules., He,, as, director,, would, address, the, cast, about, any, issues., The, writers, would, communicate, through, Mary,, to, Josh, if, we, had, any, comments., The, writers, would, be, present, to, watch, the, rehearsals,, but, we, were, to, mainly, take, notes, on, our, material, and, provide, suggestions, when, asked., The, rehearsal, room, is, actually, backstage, of, the, Skybox, Theater., There, is, no, stage, and, it, is, all, one, level., This, could, prove, interesting, since, the, Skybox, stage, has, different, levels., But, I, am, sure, our, cast, can, adapt, to, the, multi-level, stage, come, performance, time., We, will, have, a, few, rehearsals, on, the, stage, the, week, of, the, first, show., The, cast, did, some, readings, of, the, sketches,, and, I, was, again, amazed, at, how, in, a, first, reading,, these, talented, people, could, add, so, much, to, our, written, words, just, by, their, choice, of, accent,, cadence, and, expression., It, is, really, a, talented, group, of, people., Josh, tells, the, writers, to, start, thinking, about, a, title, -, he, sees, a, theme, of, a, skewed, view, of, Americana., A, dysfunctional, America., Hearing, many, of, the, sketches, read, aloud, by, people, outside, our, writing, group, also, pointed, out, where, some, re-writes, are, necessary., At, the, end, of, the, rehearsal,, we, talk, as, a, group, and, Josh, lets, me, know, he, would, like, one, of, my, sketches, to, be, split, in, three, smaller, pieces, to, be, used, as, a, runner., He, also, wants, there, to, be, more, characters, in, the, scene., Oh, God,, my, first, re-write, and, it, has, to, be, major., Cool!, This, is, what, I, really, want, to, experience, -, can, I, be, creative, and, satisfy, the, director, with, my, re-writes?, This, is, a, challenge, I, want, to, tackle., November, 1,, 2000, This, is, a, blocking, rehearsal., Josh, is, out, of, the, country, directing, one, of, the, Second, City, touring, companies., His, fiancee,, Nyima,, has, received, notes, from, him, and, she, will, help, block, the, scenes, as, written., My, writing, friends, and, I, have, met, the, challenge, and, we, all, turned, in, re-writes, of, our, material., Nyima, gives, us, the, tentative, running, order., Interesting, -, I, had, re-written, the, one, sketch, to, two, separate, mini-sketches., The, problem, is,, it, is, listed, as, three, sketches, in, the, running, order., Instant, re-write, is, coming., Idiot,, look, at, the, diary, from, last, week, -, Josh, said, to, make, it, three, parts!, The, cast, has, studied, their, scripts., Even, though, this, is, only, the, second, rehearsal,, I, see, some, great, characters, and, added, actions, that, make, our, written, characters, come, to, life., How, do, they, do, it?, For, my, sketches,, I, am, seeing, one, cast, member, take, her, three, simple, lines, (which, she, saw, for, the, first, time, tonight), and, create, a, woman, character, that, now, gets, the, best, laughs., And, most, come, from, her, reactions, to, what, is, being, said, to, her, or, about, her., This, was, a, character, that, was, added, only, because, Josh, wanted, me, to, include, the, full, cast, -, the, sketch, was, one, character, short, and, it, had, to, be, a, female, character., So, I, took, out, my, trusty, pen, and, added, "Sally", -, who, previously, had, only, been, mentioned, as, the, "bitch", Fred, married., I, gave, her, three, lines, and, -, Wow, -, what, a, character, was, born., I, am, going, to, like, this..., Nyima, was, fantastic., She, explained, a, choice, Josh, made, for, staging, the, show., All, the, cast, members, will, be, constantly, on, stage., If, they, are, not, in, the, scene,, they, will, sit, towards, the, rear, of, the, stage., This, way, we, can, quickly, go, from, scene-to-scene, and, get, in, as, many, sketches, as, possible, in, our, 75, minute, show., The, re-writes, of, my, fellow, writers, were, also, awsome., I, think, we, were, all, inspired, by, having, our, material, read, by, the, cast, the, week, before., Sketches, that, we, all, knew, still, needed, work, suddenly, were, sharper, and, better, written, in, the, past, week., Since, our, class, had, been, reading, these, scenes, for, weeks, among, ourselves,, we, were, limited, to, how, "we", read, them., Now, our, real, actors, had, added, their, talents, and, suddenly, new, life, was, born, as, we, could, see, more, possibilites, for, the, characters., The, whole, show, was, blocked, knowing, it, would, change,, but, we, only, have, four, weeks, to, put, this, show, together., At, a, break,, the, writers, talk, with, the, cast, -, yes, we, are, not, supposed, to, talk, about, the, scenes, -, and, we, really, don't., A, quick, exchange, of, compliments, does, take, place,, and, then, we, just, talk, about, what, we, do, for, our, day, jobs., A, great, group, of, people., The, writers, meet, at, the, bar, across, Wells, Street, from, Second, City., We, talk, about, ideas, for, the, name, of, the, show, and, give, each, other, notes, on, some, re-write, possibilities., Everyone's, excitement, about, the, show, is, growing., We, still, need, to, have, a, song, added, and, we, disucss, other, writing, projects, we, want, to, do., I, am, really, digging, this., November, 8,, 2000, Josh, is, back, and, we, first, start, talking, about, the, weird, Presidential, election, and, how, it, may, be, weeks, before, we, know, who, the, next, President, of, the, U.S., will, be., The, writers, have, turned, in, more, re-writes, including, me., I, have, made, one, of, my, sketches, into, three, mini-scenes, and, Mary, says, it, is, now, a, tight, concept., I, must, admit,, I, like, this, writing, to, a, deadline, and, meeting, the, goals, of, the, director, -, how, he, needs, to, fit, it, in, the, show., I, can, still, be, creative,, but, I, can, solve, his, problem, with, my, writing, if, asked., After, that, particular, piece, is, performed,, Josh, lets, me, know, he, really, likes, the, new, three, part, version., No, rewrites, are, asked, for, that, one!, (for, now, at, least), The, cast, goes, through, the, many, scenes, and, Josh, performs, his, magic, of, directing., Just, by, positioning, the, cast, differently, for, one, sketch,, a, line, that, originally, was, flat,, becomes, a, real, nice, laugh., We, spend, a, lot, of, time, blocking, one, scene, that, is, very, physical, for, the, actors., I, am, not, sure, they, can, get, to, my, sketches, before, the, end, of, the, night., We, do,, and, both, go, over, great., No, re-writes, are, asked, for, my, second, sketch, either., This, cast, is, great., They, improvise, on, a, few, scenes, and, I, see, how, really, talented, they, can, be., I, realize, I, am, writing, this, diary, with, kind, of, an, "Oh, golly, gee, whiz", point-of-view,, but, that, is, how, this, whole, event, is, playing, out, in, my, mind., Cue, Mickey, Rooney, and, Judy, Garland,, "Hey, everybody,, let's, put, on, a, show!"., Our, group, of, writers, are, also, talented., I, am, so, proud, to, be, working, them., We, are, solidfying, plans, for, written, and, performance, work, of, our, own,, once, we, finish, this, Second, City, program., At, the, end, of, rehearsal,, Josh, talks, with, the, writers., We, may, have, to, do, some, serious, cutting, after, next, week., Many, of, the, sketches, are, running, 5, minutes, and, longer., He, may, move, my, single, sketch, from, the, show, closer, because, another, sketch, has, better, potential, for, ending, on, a, song., That's, cool, with, me,, the, other, sketch, would, fit, better, as, a, closer, anyway., We, decide, on, a, title, for, our, show., Since, we, kicked, around, different, titles, last, week, we, throw, out, a, few, to, see, what, Josh, and, Mary, think, -, American, Trashity, Dysfunctional, Family, Tree, Trash, Across, America, American, Booty, and, several, other, like, sounding, titles., Josh, and, Mary, like, "American, Booty"., "It, has, better, potential, for, getting, people, to, come, see, the, show,", says, Josh., It's, hints, at, sex,, fun, and, is, a, good, play, on, the, American, Beauty, movie, title, -, which, itself, was, about, a, very, dysfunctional, family., The, writers, agree, and, Julia, will, have, a, friend, of, hers, come, up, with, graphics, for, posters, and, programs., We, agree, to, get, those, done, in, the, next, two, weeks., The, only, writing, I, have, to, do, for, the, show, this, week, is, a, four, line, "bio", for, the, program., I, think, I'll, look, at, my, sketches, and, see, where, I, can, make, cuts, in, case, I, am, asked, to, shorten, them., We, rehearse, twice, next, week, -, Wednesday, and, Friday., I, can't, wait., November, 15,, 2000, Nyima, is, filling, in, tonight., Josh's, touring, company, had, to, fill, in, on, Second, City's, Mainstage, and, then, one, of, Josh's, cast, was, sick, -, so, Josh, had, to, perform, on, the, mainstage, with, his, cast!, Nyima, worked, her, usual, magic., Josh, and, she, make, a, great, team., Up, to, this, point, I, haven't, said, what, my, sketches, were, about, -, for, fear, they, would, be, cut., What, the, Hell,, it, looks, like, they'll, stay, now., The, three, part, runner, sketch, is, about, two, cannibals, hosting, a, cooking, show., The, other, sketch, is, about, a, white, trash, wedding, reception., We, started, on, the, wedding, sketch, first, thing, today, and, spent, almost, an, hour, blocking, out, the, actions., Nyima, has, added, quite, a, few, movements, and, it, took, awhile, to, get, these, down., Mary, suggested, some, line, cuts, and, I, agreed., The, other, writers, are, concerned, we, are, taking, too, long, working, on, some, of, the, scenes., We, have, only, three, more, rehearsals, after, tonight, and, we, have, yet, to, run-through, all, the, scenes, more, than, once., After, the, wedding, sketch,, the, cast, spends, time, blocking, out, another, scene, and, it, too, takes, a, good, 45, minutes., The, cast, is, talented, and, Adam,, a, cast, member,, has, a, lot, of, physical, action, in, several, scenes., In, one, scene, Nyima, asks, him, to, do, pushups,, but, not, your, ordinary, pushups,, she, wants, him, to, do, the, kind, where, you, clap, your, hands, between, each, pushup!, Go, Adam!, We, end, up, going, over, about, 6, sketches, total, and, end, the, night, back, on, the, wedding, sketch., Two, of, the, writers, did, not, have, any, of, their, sketches, rehearsed, tonight., There, is, some, nervousness, among, the, writer, group, that, time, is, running, out., Julia, has, brought, in, two, samples, of, artwork, for, the, posters, and, programs, based, on, the, "American, Booty", title., One, is, a, picture, of, an, old, small, trailer, at, night., The, other, is, a, cartoon, showing, the, rear, of, an, overweight, man, from, the, chest, down., His, loose, pants, show, the, top, of, his, crack, and, there, is, a, small, American, flag, and, a, rose, in, his, back, pocket., I, like, the, second, graphic,, but, now, there, is, talk, that, we, may, have, to, change, the, name., Seems, "American, Booty", is, also, the, title, of, a, porno, movie, -, or, could, be, -, nobody, knows, for, sure., Mary, tells, us, we, have, to, have, the, name, and, artwork, approved, by, Second, City, anyway,, so, she, drops, it, off, in, the, office., We, should, know, by, Friday's, rehearsal, if, the, name, is, ok., I, had, sent, out, a, reminder, to, the, writers, to, write, a, short, bio, for, the, program., Mine, was, written, in, about, two, minutes, and, the, group, tells, me, they, like, it., We, ask, the, cast, to, write, their, own, bios, and, everyone, needs, to, bring, them, Friday, so, we, can, put, the, program, together., I, have, mentioned, the, show, to, a, few, people, at, work, and, they, have, been, asking, me, to, give, them, a, flyer, when, we, have, them, made, up., If, this, works, out, like, the, improv, show, I, did, last, year,, then, only, 10%, of, the, people, who, say, they, will, come,, will, actually, come, to, the, show., We, hope, to, have, sold, out, shows, since, one, of, the, other, writing, classes, had, sold, out, three, nights., The, theater, only, holds, 70, people, so, we're, told, to, have, our, friends, and, family, reserve, tickets, in, advance, just, in, case., A, few, of, the, writers, head, to, the, bar, across, the, street, and, talk, about, the, show., We, are, still, excited, and, Joe, tells, us, we, are, way, ahead, of, the, writer, show, he, acted, in, earlier, this, year., No, worries, then, -, well,, not, many, anyway., November, 17,, 2000, Our, Friday, night, rehearsal, since, we, won't, rehearse, next, week, (day, before, Thanksgiving)., Well, both, Nyima, and, Josh, were, there, tonight., We, went, over, my, wedding, sketch, again, to, show, Josh, the, changes, in, blocking., Then, we, severely, cut, a, lot, of, dialog., The, opening, had, several, long, speeches, setting, the, scene,, but, we, cut, those, down, by, 2/3, and, the, dialog, moves, faster., I, mentioned, on, November, 1st, how, Sally, was, added, and, the, actress, just, took, the, three, lines, and, ran, with, it., Well,, Josh, decided, she, was, doing, such, a, great, job, miming, actions,, that, we, should, cut, her, three, lines, and, just, give, her, one, big, line, to, end, the, sketch., And, oh, yeah,, Jerry, could, you, come, up, with, that, line?, Hmm..., The, cast, re-did, the, scene, after, the, cuts, and, I, am, amazed, at, how, much, better, and, tighter, it, is., Remember, kids,, keep, the, dialog, tight, and, crisp., I, am, even, more, impressed, with, the, cast, and, Josh, now., But, that, big, laugh, line, at, the, end, has, me, worried., How, do, I, come, up, with, that?, Julia, shows, me, a, song, she, came, up, with, based, on, my, wedding, sketch, and, characters., It's, a, square, dance,, high-energy, type, number., I, love, it, and, she, shows, it, to, Mary, and, Josh., Josh, does, a, quick, read-through, and, says, it, will, work, as, a, show, closer., So, my, wedding, sketch, is, back, to, being, the, closer, that, ends, with, the, song, -, for, now., The, other, writers, get, their, work, put, up, and, many, more, cuts, are, taking, place., The, show, is, really, long, with, most, sketches, being, 5, pages., We, get, mine, down, to, just, over, three, pages, and, I, am, happy., Josh, tells, Alan, that, he, likes, Alan's, blues, song, better, than, Alan's, Prince, "1999, "parody, sung, by, Bill, Clinton., It's, at, this, point, we, find, out, Josh, will, also, be, playing, the, piano, for, our, show., God, this, guy, is, talented., Adam,, a, cast, member,, has, brought, his, guitar, and, Josh, and, Adam, work, out, a, fast, blues, riff., The, cast, gathers, round, and, they, rehearse, the, blues, song., This, is, the, first, time, Josh, has, to, yell, at, the, writers, to, be, quiet., Josh, has, been, extremely, patient, with, the, writers, up, to, now., I, would, have, told, us, to, shut, up, a, few, weeks, ago., I, decide, to, step, in, the, hallway, and, the, rest, of, the, writers, follow, over, the, next, few, minutes., Julia, has, brought, an, updated, flyer, and, poster, artwork., The, show, will, stay, named, "American, Booty", as, Rob, Chambers, thought, it, was, great., The, artwork, we, decided, to, go, with, has, a, silhouette, of, an, old, trailer, against, a, striped, sky, of, two, shades, of, blue., A, silhouette, of, a, man, with, a, big, belly, and, butt, stands, outside, the, trailer, and, there, is, a, cluster, of, stars., It, looks, really, great., The, writers, decide, to, pay, extra, for, having, the, flyers, made, in, color., The, rehearsal, goes, on, past, 10:00, PM., We, have, gone, through, a, good, part, of, the, show, and, with, the, cuts, in, dialog, there, seems, to, be, a, new, energy., Josh, tells, the, cast, they, can, commit, the, sketches, to, memory, at, this, point., There, will, be, no, more, major, cuts., We, have, two, more, rehearsals, before, the, first, show, and, they, will, go, very, late, as, they, finally, get, a, chance, to, rehearse, on, stage, and, get, lighting, down., We, are, into, the, home, stretch..., November, 28,, 2000, Rehearsal, tonight, started, a, little, after, 10:00, PM., The, actors, got, together, the, night, before, on, their, own, and, went, through, line, readings., This, was, the, first, time, we, were, in, the, Skybox, Theater, since, auditions., Our, lighting, and, sound, guy,, Jason,, was, there, and, Josh, had, prerecorded, music, and, a, list, of, where, he, wanted, the, music, played, for, each, scene., (That, must, have, taken, hours, to, put, together.), Josh, explained, we, would, go, through, the, complete, running, order,, but, probably, only, the, beginnings, and, endings, (tops, &, bottoms), of, the, scenes, to, get, the, lighting,, music, cues,, and, scene, transitions, down., The, cast, was, in, a, very, good, mood., They, actually, did, rehearse, and, block, the, complete, first, sketch., It, was, great, to, see, the, cast, work, without, scripts., I, was, amazed, at, how, few, times, lines, were, actually, missed., Josh's, directing, brought, even, more, life, to, the, sketch., Josh, gave, the, running, order, as, of, now., My, Cannibal, 3, -, part, sketch, is, slated, to, start, about, 5, scenes, into, the, show., Josh, hadn't, decided, at, which, points, he, would, insert, the, other, 2, parts., The, wedding, sketch, is, still, the, closer, plus, Julia's, hoedown, song, at, the, end., I, came, up, with, a, couple, of, lines, to, end, the, wedding, sketch., I, show, them, to, Kate, (the, actress), and, then, give, them, to, Josh, and, Mary., We, never, get, to, rehearse, the, wedding, sketch, so, I, still, don't, know, how, the, last, line, sounds., Rehearsal, goes, to, midnight, and, the, writers, are, released., The, cast, stays, with, Josh, for, what, is, supposed, to, be, a, half-hour, more., We'll, see, how, late, they, stayed..., Julia, has, brought, in, the, larger, color, poster, of, our, show, for, display, outside, the, theater., It, has, the, same, trailer/man, graphic, and, lists, the, cast, members, names,, and, then, the, director, and, writers., It, looks, good., I, have, sent, out, several, of, the, flyers, to, friends, and, Chicago, writer, agents., Who, knows,, maybe, an, agent, will, come, -, the, worst, that, can, happen, is, they, don't., I, also, sent, information, about, the, show, and, the, writers, to, some, local, TV, programs., I, receive, email, from, one, producer, who, states, a, television, piece, on, writers, is, probably, not, visually, exciting, enough, -, but, he, has, been, thinking, of, adding, a, sketch, segment, to, his, show., Would, I, like, to, talk, with, him, and, bat, around, some, ideas?, I've, always, wanted, to, say, this, -, "We're, doing, lunch"., American, Booty, rehearsal, tomorrow, 7:00, PM, til, ???, We, hope, to, get, through, the, whole, show, and, have, the, cast, learn, the, hoedown, song, -, yes,, learn, the, song, two, days, before, the, first, performance!, Glad, I, get, to, sit, in, the, audience., November, 29,, 2000, Rehearsal, for, the, second, day, in, a, row., I, should, be, tired, since, I, didn't, get, home, until, almost, 2:00, AM, and, had, to, get, up, at, 5:30, AM, for, work., I, guess, the, adrenaline, for, the, show, going, up, in, two, days, has, energized, me., I, show, up, a, little, early, and, talk, with, Josh, and, Mary., They, both, are, excited, with, the, show., Josh, tells, me, he, wants, to, combine, the, Cannibal, sketch, into, 2, scenes., He, also, asks, for, a, different, rewrite, of, the, third, part., He, wants, to, use, it, to, transition, to, my, Wedding, sketch., He, would, like, the, rewrite, before, the, night, is, over, so, Marz, can, memorize, the, last, line, which, will, describe, the, setting, of, the, wedding, reception, sketch., I, wanted, to, write, to, deadline?, Well, I, got, my, wish!, Nyima, (now, married, to, Josh), has, been, picked, to, join, the, Second, City, mainstage, cast!, She, is, quite, a, talent, and, deserves, the, honor., I, now, know, a, Mainstage, actress...cool., Rehearsal, goes, pretty, well., The, writers, are, a, little, nervous, about, changes., I,, unfortunately,, am, re-writing, the, Cannibal, ending, and, going, over, the, changes, with, Josh, who, seems, to, really, want, some, specific, words, used., I, keep, trying., I, finally, hit, on, the, combination, Josh, likes, and, get, to, watch, an, entire, run, through, of, the, show, with, lights, and, music., It, goes, fairly, smoothly., The, actors, have, taken, a, hard, job, of, learning, lines,, including, last, minute, re-writes, and, committed, them, to, memory., The, writers, see, many, instances, of, dropped, and, botched, lines,, but, I, give, the, cast, credit, for, really, trying., Poor, Adam, is, in, so, many, scenes, that, I, am, amazed, he, remembers, any, lines., He, has, a, few, lines, in, the, Cannibal, sketch, and, has, not, really, nailed, those, lines, down., He, asks, for, "Line!", on, almost, every, one, in, the, rehearsal., I, have, seen, the, show, so, many, times, now,, that, I, wonder, if, it, is, funny, at, all., My, sketches, alone, have, been, with, me, since, I, created, them, in, March, and, April, -, and, now, it, is, December., The, Cannibal, sketch, is, completely, different, from, the, first, draft, and, the, Wedding, sketch, has, had, major, changes, also., The, cast, has, been, great., They, have, gotten, a, little, away, from, the, actual, written, lines,, and, they, tend, to, throw, in, the, old, "F", word, if, they, forget, a, line., Josh, reminds, the, cast, at, the, end, of, the, long, night, to, get, back, to, the, original, lines, for, the, show,, and, try, to, refrain, from, throwing, in, the, "F", word, if, they, "go, up"., Fuck., I, hope, that, doesn't, piss, off, the, cast., Showtime, Friday, 8:00, PM., We, are, to, meet, at, 6:00, to, go, through, the, show, one, more, time., See, you, there!, Friday, December, 1,, 2000, Opening, Night!, I, took, Thursday, off, of, work, since, I, had, only, a, few, hours, of, sleep, over, 36, hours., Wasn't, much, into, the, work, thing, today, as, all, I, did, was, think, about, the, show., A, woman, I, work, with, is, coming, to, the, show, and, bringing, her, 70-year-old, mother., I, hope, her, Mom, doesn't, mind, a, little, swearing., OK,, maybe, a, lot, of, swearing., My, family, and, some, friends, are, coming, next, week., I, arrive, at, 6:00, and, talk, with, Mary, and, Josh., Some, of, the, actors, are, there, and, going, through, lines., I, offer, to, run, out, get, drinks, for, them, and, head, over, to, the, Walgreens, across, the, street., Out, I, walk, with, several, bottles, of, water,, and, a, Gatorade, and, Frappuccino, for, Josh., There, is, a, homeless, guy, who, always, sells, "Streetwise", outside, the, Walgreen's, and, because, I, am, feeling, pretty, lucky, about, my, place, in, the, world, tonight,, I, slip, him, a, buck, and, tell, him, to, keep, the, paper, and, keep, warm., The, cast, begins, the, run-through, of, the, show., The, other, writers, show, up, about, around, 7:00, PM, and, ask, how, the, rehearsal, is, going., I, let, them, know, the, cast, has, gotten, back, to, the, original, lines, (in, my, opinion), and, looks, good., The, writers, are, asked, to, go, in, the, lobby, and, we, are, instructed, on, our, usher, duties., I, get, to, greet, and, seat, any, latecomers., Woo-woo!, The, ticket, office, tells, us, we, have, a, sold-out, show., I, said, earlier, in, the, diary, the, theater, holds, 70, -, well, we, jam, in, over, 90, people!, Hot, damn!, Oops...sorry, hot, darn!, Just, before, we, let, in, the, crowd,, the, writers, are, asked, to, come, back, in, the, theater., Josh, tells, us, that, after, the, cast, bows, at, the, end, of, the, show,, they, will, gesture, to, Josh, (who, will, be, down, front, playing, the, piano),, then, they, gesture, to, the, Jason,, the, lights, and, sound, dude, extraordinaire,, then, they, will, gesture, to, US, -, THE, WRITERS!, We, will, then, run, up, on, stage, in, front, of, the, cast, and, take, a, bow., Then, one, final, bow, by, both, the, cast, and, the, writers, and, guess, what...everyone, bows, when, JERRY, bows., I, have, a, moment, in, the, show!, We, rehearse, this, all, important, moment., I, think, I, got, it, down, pat., 7:50, and, we, open, the, doors., It, is, obvious, the, audience, is, made, up, of, friends, and, family, of, the, cast, and, writers., The, theater, fills, up, and, about, 8:08, PM, the, show, begins!, I, am, still, in, the, lobby, of, the, Skybox, since, my, job, is, to, usher, in, any, latecomers., I, can, hear, the, show, through, the, doors, and, sneak, a, peek., The, music, is, loud, and, the, audience, is, a, little, shy, in, laughing, at, the, opening, sketch., The, cast, seems, a, little, tight, and, talking, quickly, but, that, soon, changes., I, hear, the, transition, music, to, the, second, sketch, -, I, peek, in, again., Then, two, couples, walk, in, to, the, lobby., They, are, friends, of, one, of, the, writers, and, drove, in, from, the, suburbs., The, snow, made, them, a, little, late., The, ticket, booth, tells, them, -, sorry, sold, out., They, are, shocked, a, little., But, they, came, in, from, the, suburbs!, They, know, one, of, the, writers, -, please, they'll, stand!, Mary, gets, them, in, and, gives, them, the, writers', seats, against, the, wall., I, sneak, back, in, at, the, end, of, the, second, sketch., The, crowd, is, still, a, little, nervous., By, the, third, sketch,, the, audience, is, comfortable, with, the, cast, and, they, start, loosening, up., God,, I, wish, they, all, had, a, few, drinks, in, the, lobby, first, -, but, hey,, third, sketch, laughs, are, fine., I, shoot, some, looks, to, Mike, and, Scott, standing, near, me, as, the, audience, laughs,, or, the, cast, misses, a, line., This, is, exciting., We, are, hearing, spontaneous, laughing, and, getting, nervous, ourselves, as, our, sketches, come, up., My, cannibal, sketch, isn't, until, the, middle, of, the, show, so, I, watch, as, the, other, writer's, bite, their, lips, when, their, material, goes, up., A, few, blown, lines, here, and, there,, and, a, shy, audience,, but, overall, pretty, good, so, far., The, audience, really, gets, going, at, the, end, of, Alan's, "Ladies, Night, Out", sketch., The, ending, has, the, women, beating, the, shit, out, of, the, guys, in, slow, motion, to, the, music, of, the, 1812, overture., It, goes, over, well., Pastor, of, Disaster, is, next, and, has, Marz, as, a, black, southern, preacher, in, a, Wisconsin,, uptight, church., The, rest, of, the, cast, is, in, the, audience, so, Marz, "preaches, to, the, crowd, and, asks, for, some, "Amens!", we, thought, the, crowd, may, respond, to, him,, but, they, were, dead, silent., That, was, OK, because, the, premise, of, the, sketch, is, that, the, Wisconsinites, were, uptight, and, wary, of, this, black, preacher., The, sketch, ends, with, cast, running, on, stage, and, dancing, and, gyrating, to, a, gospel, piano, riff., We, get, the, audience, back, at, that, point., Scott, has, stepped, into, the, lobby, later, explaining, he, was, too, nervous, to, be, in, the, theater, while, his, sketch, was, going, on., Hell,, they'll, have, to, drag, me, out, when, mine, come, up!, The, next, couple, of, sketches, go, well., A, few, dropped, lines, in, Joe's, 'Ole, Sergeant, sketch, throw, off, the, timing, but, it, does, well., Next, up, is, Alan's, second, sketch, which, is, the, stay, at, home, Dad, blues, song., Again, a, nice, job., The, audience, is, settling, in,, but, I, think, the, overall, timing, of, the, cast, is, a, little, off, -, opening, night, jitters, I, presume., Scott, and, Alan, have, seen, both, of, their, sketches, performed, -, they, can, relax, until, our, final, bow., But, next, up, is, my, work., It, is, time, for, the, comic, genius, that, is, Jerry, Krull..., Some, Marley, music, plays, and, the, offstage, Allison, gives, the, "TV", introduction, of, the, Culinary, Cannibal, Show, -, live, from, the, Pacific, Isles., Here's, your, hosts, Zoemaht, and, Toongaya!, Lights, up, stage, right, on, a, shirtless, Marz, and, Jim., Oh,, did, I, not, mention, that, Marz, and, Jim, decided, to, go, shirtless, for, the, cannibal, scene?, This, stage, picture, alone, brought, out, some, laughs-, my, stomach, relaxed, -, I, hadn't, realized, my, stomach, had, tightened, until, the, laughs, loosened, it, up., The, boys, performed, great, with, their, smarmy, yet, weird, accents, of, the, cannibals., The, first, few, funny, lines, got, a, couple, laughs, -, I, had, hoped, for, more., The, sketch, has, some, dark, lines, about, how, to, prepare, a, dead, relative, for, dinner., It, received, the, groans, I, wanted,, so, to, me, it, was, a, success., Then, Adam, came, in, for, his, part., A, few, blown, lines, threw, off, the, timing, so, some, laughs, were, lost, as, the, lines, were, lost., Oh, well, -, this, was, still, fun., The, scene, ends, with, no, laugh, (kind, of, expected, since, we, will, see, it, continued, later), and, my, first, scene, is, over., I, was, happy, it, received, a, few, laughs, and, the, groans., Poor, Jim, is, also, in, the, next, sketch, and, he, barely, gets, his, shirt, on, in, time, before, the, lights, go, up., There, are, four, sketches, again, before, Cannibals, come, back, and, that, leads, directly, to, the, closer, -, my, Wedding, in, Sauk, Village, sketch., Accidental, Therapist,, Buck, Fitty,, and, Prissy, Prude, go, over, warmly, -, timing, seems, to, still, be, off, a, little., The, line, at, the, end, of, Buck, Fitty, delivered, by, Marz, gets, the, biggest, laugh, of, the, night, -, as, expected., Joe's, "Grace", sketch, gets, some, really, good, consistent, laughs., Then, we, lead, back, to, Cannibals..., Marz, and, Jim, again, are, shirtless, and, the, crowd, giggles, again., There, really, is, only, one, funny, line, delivered, by, Jim, instructing, the, audience, to, choose, Midwesterners, for, their, roasts, since, they, tend, to, be, well-marbled, and, quite, tender., Then, Marz, delivers, the, four, lines, about, Midwesterners, that, describes, the, backyard, scene, for, the, wedding, sketch., The, rest, of, the, cast, has, taken, their, places, for, the, Wedding, sketch, and, they, slouch, on, cue, as, the, lights, center, stage, come, up., What's, this?, Jim, is, still, shirtless!, He, kicks, off, the, scene, with, his, lines, in, his, white, trash, southern-tinged, accent., The, audience, is, laughing, and, I, think, it, actually, helps, the, scene., The, scene, plays, out, as, this, white, trash, dysfunctional, family, stumbles, through, this, backyard, reception., Laughs, are, coming, pretty, good, and, I, feel, quite, proud., Marz, does, not, come, into, the, scene, for, a, couple, of, minutes, and, when, he, does, he, brings, Jim's, shirt, out, to, him, and, ad-libs, a, line, justifying, the, shirt, delivery., The, scene, ends, with, Kate's, one, line, and, then, the, cast, goes, into, the, Hoedown, song, "American, Dysfunction"., The, song, is, high, energy, and, the, crowd, gets, into, it., There, was, no, time, for, the, audience, to, react, to, Kate's, line, -, so, I, still, don't, know, if, I, wrote, a, killer, line, for, her., I, was, sorry, that, Josh, had, asked, Kate, to, just, slouch, drunk, on, stage, until, her, last, line., The, reactions, she, was, giving, in, rehearsals, had, been, cracking, us, up,, and, they, were, needed, in, the, show., Regardless,, it, still, went, over, very, well., As, the, song, progressed,, the, writers, made, our, way, to, the, side, of, the, stage, for, our, bow., The, show, ends, and, the, cast, bows,, the, gestures, come, and, soon, we, the, writers, are, running, on, to, the, stage., I, distinctly, remember, hearing, an, enthusiastic, "Yes!", from, one, audience, member, as, the, writers, ran, up, on, the, stage., Julia, led, the, writer, bow,, then, the, cast, stepped, up, and, I, waited, for, the, cue, for, all, of, us, to, take, the, final, bow...., Waiting...waiting...oh, SHIT;, I'm, the, cue!, One, damn, thing, to, do, in, the, whole, show, and, I, blow, it!, We, take, the, bow, and, scurry, of, the, stage, to, applause, from, our, gracious, audience., Show, one, -, DONE!, Back, stage, we, all, gather, and, share, cheap, Champagne., Josh, toasts, us, all,, compliments, abound,, and, all, is, happy, and, healthy., The, cast, starts, talking, about, their, mistakes, and, we, all, find, different, things, to, laugh, about., Hugs,, back, slaps, and, occasional, male, dry, humping, abounds., Is, it, wrong?, Most, of, us, head, over, to, Corcorans, after, and, we, drink, the, night, away., Nyima, stops, in, between, shows, on, the, mainstage, and, congratulates, the, cast, and, writers., Josh, seems, really, pleased, with, the, show, and, tells, me, he, forgot, how, dark, the, Cannibal, sketch, really, is, until, he, heard, the, audience, reaction., But, he, picked, it, because, it, was, really, the, only, dark, humor, sketch, in, the, show., I, didn't, get, a, chance, to, talk, with, my, friend, from, work, after, the, show,, so, I, have, to, wait, for, a, week, since, she, is, going, on, vacation, the, next, day, and, will, not, be, back, at, work., But, at, the, bar, I, am, introduced, to, several, friends, and, family, members, of, the, cast, and, writers., Several, are, quite, kind, and, congratulate, me, on, the, Wedding, sketch., At, the, same, time, they, give, me, weird, looks, trying, to, describe, their, feelings, about, the, cannibal, sketch., Just, the, reaction, I, expected., One, person, says, the, best, writing, of, the, night, was, my, biography, in, the, program., Hmm,, I'll, take, that., No, rehearsals, until, the, night, of, the, second, show, next, week., I, get, home, about, 2:00, AM, and, slowly, drift, to, sleep, thinking, of, what, a, great, life, experience, this, is., December, 8,, 2000, Second, show!, The, cast, is, there, about, 6:30, and, is, going, over, lines., Adam, in, particular, is, taking, a, pretty, good, look, at, all, his, scripts., He, seems, a, little, tense., His, family, was, at, the, first, show, and, they, gave, him, some, notes, on, his, performance., He, decides, to, change, the, accent, of, his, character, in, the, opening, scene, because, his, family, says, it, is, the, same, accent, he, uses, as, a, different, character, later, in, the, show., Josh, OK's, the, change., Josh, also, shortens, the, second, segment, of, the, Buck, Fitty, sketch, -, Mike, (the, writer), is, not, around, while, the, sketch, changes, and, is, a, little, worried, when, we, tell, him, later, it, was, shortened., I, do, my, run, for, the,

player., There, are, many, lines, that, are, dropped., Scott, and, I, discuss, that, the, cast, did, not, have, any, rehearsals, since, the, first, show., Could, this, be, a, bad, sign?, I, decide, to, hang, out, in, the, lobby, of, the, Skybox, Theater, since, my, wife, and, father, are, coming, tonight., Also, several, friends, are, supposed, to, show, up., We, again, have, 90, people, with, 10, of, them, being, people, I, know., Kim, Clark, the, director, of, the, writing, program, shows, up, with, a, small, group, of, Second, City, people., I, talk, with, my, wife, and, father, in, the,

school, show, on, Friday�, always, the, support., And, with, that, I, give, you, my, program, "bio":, Jerry, Krull's, father, would, like, to, point, out, Jerry, has, an, MBA, he, is, throwing, away..., THROWING, AWAY..., pursuing, this, comedy, writing, crap., This, is, NOT, how, he, brought, up, Jerry., There, are, five, other, good, kids, in, the, family., They, took, honors, math,, but, not, Jerry,, oh, no., He, could, have, if, he, applied, himself., He, just, didn't, try..., My, father's, reaction, to, that, bio?, He, laughed, and, said,, "Oh,, so, you, agree, with, me, now.", I, stay, out, in, the, lobby, until, the, crowd, is, let, in., Then, Alan,, Scott, and, I, hang, out, near, the, rear, of, the, theater, and, watch, the, show, start., The, crowd, gets, into, the, show, a, little, quicker, than, the, crowd, the, week, before., But, lines, are, being, dropped, left, and, right, by, the, cast., Alan,, Scott, and, I, look, at, each, other, after, each, mistake, �, I, hope, this, is, just, first, sketch, jitters., The, second, sketch, starts, and, Scott,, like, last, week,, steps, into, the, lobby, since, it's, his, sketch., Lines, get, mangled, again, but, the, audience, is, still, a, little, livelier, than, the, previous, week., Scott, re-enters, near, the, end, and, comments, on, the, missed, lines, that, he, heard, through, the, doors., The, third, sketch, begins, and, lines, are, again, missed., The, cast, is, rolling, with, it, and, they, work, their, way, back, to, the, script,, but, it, is, throwing, off, their, timing, big-time., When, a, cast, member, jumps, about, five, lines, ahead, in, the, Joe's, Ole, Sergeant, sketch,, Joe, makes, his, way, to, us,, tears, off, his, sweater, and, slams, it, against, the, wall., The, crowd, doesn't, know, all, the, lines, are, being, blown, �, only, the, cast, and, we, the, writers, know, that., The, audience, actually, is, laughing, more, than, last, week's, audience., As, each, new, sketch, starts,, the, writers, look, at, each, other, �, which, line, will, be, blown, in, this, sketch?, We, even, start, to, laugh, ourselves, when, the, mistake, ultimately, happens., My, Cannibals, sketch, gets, its, share, of, flubbed, lines., Mercifully,, we, get, to, the, end, of, the, show., Even, the, Wedding, sketch, has, dropped, lines, and, miscues., Jim, does, have, his, shirt, on, for, the, whole, sketch, this, week., Time, comes, for, the, bows, and, we, head, backstage., A, little, more, tense, tonight, after, the, show., No, Champagne,, no, high, fives., The, cast, remarks, that, the, audience, seemed, a, little, "off"., They, start, to, talk, about, blown, lines., Adam, quickly, gets, dressed, and, he, apologizes, to, me, for, blowing, so, many, lines, in, my, sketches., Kim, Clark, comes, in, and, comments, favorably, on, the, show., He, asks, the, writers, what, we, thought,, and, after, some, nervous, side, glances,, someone, mentions, it, seemed, rough., Kim, stated, he, thought, the, audience, reaction, was, great,, and, that, he, felt, it, was, one, of, the, best, Writer's, shows, he, had, seen., Joe, leaves, quickly, and, does, not, go, to, the, bar, across, the, street, afterwards., I, make, my, way, to, the, lobby,, but, my, wife, and, father, have, already, left., Some, friends, from, my, improvisation, class, had, stayed, around, to, talk., They, give, some, nice, compliments, and, tell, me, it, was, a, very, good, show., I, wander, over, to, the, bar, and, meet, up, with, the, remaining, writers, and, cast, members., The, cast, realizes, Joe, was, really, upset,, and, they, decide, to, have, a, rehearsal, on, their, own, before, the, next, show., The, comments, from, the, audience, were, positive, �, so, maybe, the, writers, made, too, much, of, the, mistakes., When, I, talk, with, my, friends, and, family, over, the, next, few, days, �, I, find, they, liked, the, show., My, wife, and, father, liked, Joe's, "Grace", sketch, the, best., My, wife, thought, my, wedding, sketch, was, 'OK'., She, didn't, care, for, the, Cannibal, sketch, at, all., My, father, said, it, seemed, like, the, cast's, timing, was, off., I, was, shocked, he, picked, up, on, that., Friends, from, work, thought, the, show, was, hilarious., They, tell, me, my, wedding, sketch, was, the, best, of, the, show, and, one, woman, keeps, repeating, lines, from, the, sketch., Another, friend, of, mine,, from, my, high, school, days,, gives, me, a, rundown, sketch, by, sketch, of, the, show., He, too, tells, me, he, liked, the, Wedding, sketch, the, best., What, are, my, friends, going, to, say,, "I, like, the, other, writer's, stuff, better"?, That, kind, of, comment, can, only, come, from, one, source, -, relatives., So, I, guess, the, show, was, a, success., Next, week, �, a, new, piano, player., December, 15,, 2000, The, night, of, the, final, show!, Last, week's, problems, are, behind, us., I, show, up, early, and, do, my,

about, an, hour, before, he, has, to, get, ready, for, his, Mainstage, show., The, new, piano, player, is, quickly, picking, up, and, he, had, listened, to, an, audio-tape, of, the, show, Josh, had, made, from, the, week, before., The, cast, is, rehearsing, lines, and, they, seem, relaxed., They, run, through, the, tops, and, bottoms, for, the, whole, show., They, rehearse, the, songs, with, the, piano, player., They, run, through, a, couple, of, scenes, and, no, lines, are, dropped., This, is, a, good, sign., We, sell, out, once, again, and, have, 90, people, in, the, audience., I, have, no, friends, or, family, at, this, performance., Too, bad�, The, show, starts, off, and, swings, into, action, smoothly., The, crowd, is, loose, and, the, cast's, timing, is, right, on, target, tonight., We, writers, are, near, the, back, and, almost, giggling., Lines, that, were, never, getting, laughs, the, previous, nights, are, going, over, big., Mike, Hoffman, is, recording, the, show, on, video, and, asks, me, to, spell, him, from, time-to-time, by, sitting, in, the, front, row, and, taping, a, scene, or, two., Each, scene, goes, over, well., I, happen, to, be, taping, when, the, Cannibals, scene, comes, up., It, absolutely, kills, tonight!, There, were, laughs, and, groans, at, every, turn, and, the, delivery, was, perfect., Mike, takes, over, the, taping, after, that, sketch, and, I, make, my, way, back, to, the, other, writers., Alan, and, Scott, are, as, excited, as, I, am., Alan, comments, on, the, good, audience, reaction, to, the, Cannibal, sketch, tonight., Must, be, a, flesh-eating, kind, of, crowd., The, show, moves, along, and, all, too, soon, we, are, near, the, end., The, Cannibals, come, back, up, and, they, get, laughs, before, they, even, say, a, word., It, quickly, goes, into, the, Wedding, sketch, and,, if, I, do, say, so, myself,, it, ROCKS!, Perfect, timing,, no, dropped, lines,, crowd, laughing, throughout., Adam, even, remembered, a, little, joke, that, he, had, always, dropped, in, the, previous, shows., It, too, got, a, big, laugh., The, hoedown, song, completes, and, we, get, called, up, for, our, bows., We, take, a, nice, long, bow, �, even, I, remember, my, cue, to, lead, the, final, bow, �, and, we, "feel, the, love", for, a, minute, before, leaving, the, stage., Smiles,, hugs,, etc., are, plentiful, back, stage., Damn,, this, is, how, every, show, should, be!, Pictures, are, being, taken,, and, we, head, over, to, the, bar, once, again., Friends, of, the, cast, and, other, writers, comment, on, my, work, and, I, too,

get, a, lesson, on, using, your, own, funny, stories, from, life, and, turn, it, into, the, different, types, of, comedy., These, are, the, stories, that, other, friends, always, ask, you, to, tell, new, people, you, meet., There, are, couple, of, lessons, of, turning, them, into, Stand-up,, a, lesson, on, adding, them, into, a, speech,, a, couple, of, lessons, on, Sketch, writing,, TV, sitcom,,

expensive, course, up-front., A, lot, of, young, and, even, boomers, feel, they, could, be, funny, and, funny, writers,, but, they, don't, know, how, to, start., My, course, let's, them, find, out,
