has, a, rich,, dark, patina, more, common, to, old, Guatemalan, masks, than, Mexican, ones., The, fit, is, extremely, comfortable, for, a, variety, of, facial, shapes., To, a, collector,, the, back, of, a, mask, is, sometimes, more, important, than, the, front., An, authentic,, old, patina, on, the, back, is, a, testimony, to, the, mask's, use, in, its, rightful, context., The, piece, at, the, left, is, authentic, but, with, many, masks, commonly, encountered, in, the, marketplace, and, through, dealers,, clever, techniques, have, been, used, by, artisan-carvers, to, create, a, false, patina, intended, to, make, the, mask, seem, older, or, more, valuable, than, it, really, is., False, wear, marks,, deliberate, abuse, and, subsequent, repairs, are, also, used, in, this, crafty,

TOUR, ---->, continue, ----------back, to, main, index,  , Tusked, Negrito, -, Oaxaca, This, Vaderesque, mask, from, Oaxaca, is, a, "Negrito, Colmilludo", (tusked, little, black, one)., The, Baile, de, los, Negritos, Colmilludos, is, unique, to, the, "Villa, Alta", sierra, near, the, historic, pueblo, of, Yalalag, and, the, dance, is, well, documented, in, paintings, dating, from, the, 19th, century., Negritos, Colmilludos, are, produced, in, different, styles, but, most, have, vertical, rectangular, cuts, in, a, protruding, and, sharply, truncated, mouth, with, a, tiny, curved, snout, above., Javelin, teeth, are, preferred, for, the, tusks,, (as, shown, in, photo,), but, in, their, absence, wood, and, leather, are, used., The, eyebrows, often, have, thin,, painted, striations, and, the, artistic, design, is, refreshingly, absent, of, Spanish-European, influence., The, locals, of, Yalalag, are, proud, of, their, Zapotec, ancestry., In, this, mountainous, village, of, 2,000,, the, complex, and, unusual, Zapotec, dialect, is, still, preferred, to, spoken, Spanish,, reflecting, their, independent, mindset, as, a, people., If, you, ever, want, to, see, Yalalag,, it, takes, six, uncomfortable, hours, on, a, bumpy, dirt, road, to, get, there, from, Oaxaca, city, and, don't, count, on, the, usual, gas, stations,, restaurants, or, bathrooms., You, will,, however,, find, conveniently, located, "pulque, stands", along, the, road., Pulque, is, an, ancient, beverage, made, from, the, fermented, maguey, plant, and, belting, down, a, few, shots, helps, the, uncomfortable, traveler, overlook, any, inconveniences., Age:, Approx., 50, years., See, also:, Striking, similarity, of, this, mask, to, a, very, familiar, face., Click, to, see, another, old, Negrito, Colmilludo.,

Zacatecas, Purchased, at, a, ranchito, outside, Zacatecas, in, the, late, 80's,, this, Pastorela, Devil, is, particularly, charming, in, its, naive, and, unpretentious, composition,, utilizing, a, single, glass, visor, eye, opening,, animal, horns,, a, cloth, tongue, and, horse, hair, headdress., One, can, easily, recognize, that, this, mask, was,, without, question,, produced, in, its, rightful, context, for, use, in, the, local, dances., Its, sale, was, never, contemplated, by, its, owner,, which, can, be, seen, as, a, desirable, and, important, quality., Age:, approx., 50, years.,

(the, drunken, woman), of, the, Baile, del, Torito, (Dance, of, the, Little, Bull)., If, you, are, such, a, man,, please, take, a, brief, moment, now, to, remember, her, and, the, good, times, you, spent, together..., La, Borracha, is, characterized, by, an, oversized,, garish, mask, with, heavy, lipstick,, eye, makeup,, rouged, cheeks, and, wig, (not, shown)., Some, might, think, of, her, as, a, tart., The, complex, El, Torito, dance, has, an, unusual, cast, of, colorful, characters, including, hunchback,, hermit, and, "El, Torito", a, body, mask, of, a, bull, worn, over, the, back, of, a, small, person., Age:, Approx., 35, years.back, <----, MASK, TOUR, ---->, continue, ----------back, to, main, index, Man's, mask, from, Guerrero, Very, old,, beautifully, carved, and, delicately, painted., The, back, is, nice, also,, heavily, worn, and, comfortable., The, facial, expression, is, angelic, and, serene., It's, difficult, to, tell, if, the, mask, represents, a, man, or, a, woman, -, although, it, is, likely, a, catrín,, a, dandy., I, can't, say, much, else, about, this, piece, except, that, it's, one, of, the, favorites, of, my, collection., Age:, over, 60, years, old., back,

seemingly, playful, festivity, staged, by, both, adults, and, children,, particularly, in, the, state, of, Michoacan., In, spite, of, a, happy, ending,, the, tiring, fandango, has, no, real, utility, other, than, to, mock, a, bevy, of, little, old, men,, all, dancing, -, or, better, to, say, hobbling, -, with, feeble, knees, and, canes, while, simultaneously, making, lecherous, fools, of, themselves., I'm, not, a, whistleblower, but, I, can't, understand, why, the, elderly, and, the, handicapped, -, true, victims, of, this, cruel, pageant, -, have, not, uttered, a, single, word, of, protest, up, to, now;, perhaps, they're, just, too, intimidated, by, the, dance's, widespread, popularity, to, complain;, thus, the, Baile, de, los, Viejitos, continues, in, its, long-standing, tradition, as, a, cute, and, endearing, icon, of, Mexican, culture., Age:, Approx., 40, years., See, also:, A, strange, viejito, experience, in, Oaxaca., back, <----, MASK, TOUR, ---->, continue, ----------back, to, main, index, Dance, of, the, Catrines, or, Paragueros,, Tlaxcala, Master, craftsmen, of, the, state, of, Tlaxcala, create, some, of, Mexico's, finest, carved, wooden, lacquer, work, in, these, realistic, masks, which, are, used, in, several, different, dances., The, most, common, are, the, Baile, de, los, Catrines, (Dance, of, the, Dandies), and, also, the, Baile, de, los, Paragueros, (Dance, of, the, Umbrella, Salesmen.), An, extremely, smooth,, reflective, finish, is, facilitated, by, use, of, a, gesso, undercoat, applied, to, the, wood,, making, fine, sanding, and, shaping, easier, for, the, carver., A, distinguishing, feature, of, the, mask, shown, at, left, are, the, "operable, eyelids", which, open, and, close, by, pulling, a, string, at, the, chin., This, is, accomplished, by, a, clever, spring, mechanism, (click, here), probably, borrowed, from, European, doll, making, techniques., The, eyes, are, glass, and, the, eyelids, have, lashes., Age:,

of, the, above, mask., Tlaxcala, has, some, renown, in, Mexican, history., During, the, conquest, of, Mexico, by, Cortez, in, the, early, 1500's,, Tlaxcalan, tribes,, unfriendly, with, the, Aztecs,, abetted, the, Spanish, in, their, invasion, of, the, valley, of, Mexico, and, thus, contributed, significantly, to, the, ultimate, defeat, of, the, Aztec, empire., Deeply, rooted, resentment, and, alienation, are, said, to, be, felt, by, some, Mexicans, to, this, day, -, but, I, say, to, anyone, who, still, feels, miffed, by, the, Tlaxcalan's, infamous, deed, -, just, let, bygones, be, bygones., After, all,, anyone, can, make, a, blooper,, right?, Age:, Approx., 50, years., See, also:, Discussion, of, the, conquest, of, Mexico, which, contrasts, both, the, Spanish, &, Aztec, points,

Guanajuato., Some, people, think, that, the, face, is, that, of, a, Mexican, movie, actor, or, politician., I, personally, think, it, looks, like, Richard, Nixon, during, a, smiling, moment., Well,, maybe, not, quite,, but, I, think, there, is, a, slight, resemblance, in, the, expression., The, Guanajuato, maskmaker, had, his, original, mask, molds, which, were, carved, out, of, wood,, serving, as, a, form, for, the, layers, of, paper., Carnival, masks, are, frequently, made, from, molds,, using, either, papier, mache,, plastic, or, cloth., Because, of, their, low, cost,, many, consider, them, to, be, throwaway, masks;, and, for, this, reason,, it, is, unusual, to, find, a, nice, old, one, like, this, because, they, are, usually, broken, and, discarded, within, a, few, years., Age:, Approx., 40, years., back, <----, MASK, TOUR, ---->, continue, ----------back, to, main, index, Pastorela, Devil, Mask, -, Jalisco, When, the, proprietor, of, this, mask, ordered, it, from, the, carver,, he, said,, "by, the, way,, super, size, that, for, me,, please.", This, formidable, piece, is, big, -, I, mean, really, big., The, ears, are, made, from, black, rubber, inner, tubes, and, the, upper, half, of, the, long, snout, articulates, via, a, cord, attached, to, the, top., This, mask, demonstrates, the, relaxed, artistic, whimsy, which, I, feel, distinguishes, Mexican, ethnic, art, in, Latin, America., I, do, not, find, this, quality, of, whimsy, in, Guatemalan, masks,, for, example,, but, many, would, argue, the, point., Although, Guatemala, is, a, major, player, in, finely, carved, Latin, American, masks,, I, personally, find, their, masks, to, be, more, predictable,, stylistically, uniform, and, restrained, than, their, Mexican, counterparts., Approximate, age:,

ethnic, art, dealer, and, his, wife,, the, bedroom, piece, is, the, one, he, doesn't, really, want, to, sell, to, you., A, clever, one, he, is,, so, he, keeps, it, in, his, bedroom, thinking, you, won't, find, it., But, aha,, you, do, find, it, -, on, the, way, to, the, bathroom, -, and, catching, him, off, guard,, you, joke, him, about, "hiding", it, from, you, -, and, you, can, then, buy, it, for, a, noble, price., A, true, mask, monger, will, do, anything, to, get, a, piece, he, really, wants, -, and, this, mask,, even, with, its, ambiguous, past,, is, to, kill, for., The, patina, is, extraordinary, and, the, original, finish, is, intact., The, distinctive, carving, and, a, deliberately, naive, expression, add, to, its, charm., Age:, Approx., 75, Years, back, <----, MASK, TOUR,

help, but, notice, that, his, pants, were, several, inches, too, short., He, handed, me, the, mask, and, I, felt, its, lightness, in, weight, -, sometimes, a, negative, characteristic, -, but, this, wood, was, tight, grained, and, of, good, quality., Most, devils, and, demons, one, encounters, are, usually, much, newer, -, and, made, primarily, for, the, purpose, of, sale., So, it, was, a, pleasant, surprise, to, find, a, nice, old, monkey, demon, which, had, been, well, used, in, its, rightful, context., I, asked, how, much, he, wanted, for, it, and, was, a, little, taken, back, by, his, price,, which, amounted, to, about, three, month's, pay, for, the, lad., But, he, went, on, to, explain, that, the, mask, had, sentimental, value,, having, belonged, to, a, now, deceased, uncle, who, used, to, dance, in, the, local, festivities., So, after, a, brief, chat, we, finalized, the, transaction, -, and, in, fond, reverence, for, the, uncle,, he, stood, firm, by, his, price., Age:,

The, hunchback, and, hermit, are, important, characters, in, the, Dance, of, the, Little, Bull., Distinct, from, the, La, Borracha, (painted, wood), mask, shown, above,, this, piece, is, resourcefully, fashioned, from, a, piece, of, hatters, felt,, riveted, with, leather, straps, and, a, stuffed, and, carefully, stitched, undulating, snout., The, well, worn, mask, also, captures,, in, its, simplicity,, a, fine, example, of, Mexican, whimsical, art., El, Baile, del, Torito, is, of, a, humorous, nature, in, its, mockery, of, past, Spanish, corruption, and, decadence., I, believe, the, dance, is, most, common, in, the, state, of, Guanajuato, in, cities, such, as, Silao,, but, it, may, possibly, be, performed, elsewhere.This, mask, was, purchased, in, the, early, 80's, from, a, family, of, Torito, dancers, in, Silao,, Guanajuato., Their, colorful, masks, were, mostly, made, of, papier, mache, and, included, a, La, Borracha, mask, (not, shown), with, a, large, wig, which,

using, parody, and, acerbic, humor, to, ridicule, authority, or, even, shame, the, benefactors, they, serve., Their, function, is, thus, more, profound, than, merely, causing, us, to, laugh., This,
