[ QuickMBA / Business, Law /, Employment, Law, Employment, Law, and, Duties, to, One's, Former, Employer, When, starting, a, company,, many, entrepreneurs, believe, that, the, end, justifies, the, means,, and, may, be, lax, about, fulfilling, obligations, to, former, employers., However,, the, fastest, way, to, put, a, startup, out, of, business, is, to, sue, it, for, violating, duties, to, a, former, employer., Even, if, no, duties, were, breached,, such, a, lawsuit, could, result, in, over, $100,000, in, legal, fees., There, are, two, types, of, duties, to, former, employers,, those, that, arise, from, tort, law, and, those, that, arise, from, contract, law., Under, agency, law, (tort, law), there, are, three, duties, that, an, employee, owes, the, employer:, Duty, of, loyalty, -, the, obligation, to, act, only, in, the, interest, of, one's, employer, and, not, to, compete, with, one's, employer., Even, if, one, is, working, on, one's, own, project, at, home, in, the, evening, using, one's, own, computer, and, equipment,, the, project, may, constitute, a, breech, of, loyalty, if, it, competes, in, the, same, line, of, business, as, that, of, the, employer., Duty, of, obedience, -, the, obligation, to, obey, all, reasonable, orders, of, one's, employer., An, act, of, insubordination, is, a, violation, of, this, duty., Duty, of, care, -, lack, of, performance, is, a, violation, of, this, duty., Under, contract, law,, there, are, confidentiality, agreements, and, restrictive, covenants., Confidentiality, agreements, -, two, restrictions, are, non-use, and, non-disclosure., A, thorough, agreement, should, have, both., An, example, of, a, confidentiality, breach, might, be, disclosing, the, identity, of, the, former, employer's, customers, to, the, new, employer., There, are, three, levels, of, confidentiality., The, lowest, level, is, public, domain, information,, followed, by, confidential, information,, and, finally, by, trade, secrets,, the, highest, of, the, three., Restrictive, covenants, -, four, types, of, restrictive, covenants, are, non-competition,, non-disparagement,, non-interference,, and, non-solicitation., The, following, outlines, the, four, types, restrictive, covenants:, A., Non-Competition, agreements, -, can, center, on, geography,, customers,, or, knowledge., A, firm, cannot, stop, another, firm, from, competing, with, it, without, a, valid, non-competition, agreement., Two, types, of, circumstances, when, non-compete, agreements, arise, are, transactional, settings, and, employer-employee, situations.,          i., transactional, settings, -, such, as, sale, of, a, business., For, example,, is, a, physician, sells, his/her, practice,, a, non-competition, agreement, might, prevent, the, same, physician, from, opening, a, new, practice, within, a, five, mile, radius., Courts, will, consider, four, factors, when, enforcing, non-competition, agreements, in, the, sale, of, a, business:,           a),  type, of, business,           b),  client, base,, size,, and, geography,           c),  impact, if, the, non-competition, agreement, were, extended,           d),  how, long, the, agreement, is, to, be, enforced,          ii., employer-employee, situations, -, this, is, different, from, transactional, settings, in, that, the, employer, and, employee, are, not, on, a, level, playing, field., Non-competition, agreements, are, blatant, restrictions, on, trade, and, are, therefore, difficult, to, enforce., However,, courts, are, more, willing, to, enforce, those, associated, with, transactional, settings, than, those, associated, with, employer-employee, relationships., However,, even, if, an, employer, knows, that, an, agreement, is, overly, restrictive, and, unenforceable,, he/she, may, have, employees, sign, it, in, order, to, make, them, think, twice, before, trying, to, compete., A, court, will, look, at, the, following, points, when, deciding, whether, to, enforce, a, non-competition, agreement:, a),  that, the, agreement, is, reasonably, limited, in, scope, such, as, duration,, geography,, client, base,, and, technology., b),  that, the, agreement, is, narrowly, tailored, to, the, interests, of, the, employer,, such, as, customer, lists,, trade, secrets,, goodwill,, or, extraordinary, skills., c),  that, the, agreement, is, supported, by, valid, consideration., The, agreement, must, be, the, product, of, some, bargain., When, people, do, not, give, something, up, in, exchange, for, something, else,, there, is, unlikely, to, be, intention, to, enforce, it., If, a, company, requests, that, present, employees, sign, a, non-compete,, the, employer, is, giving, nothing, in, exchange, for, it., This, situation, also, applies, to, employees, who, show, up, the, first, day, on, the, job, and, are, requested, to, sign, a, non-compete., In, order, to, make, it, enforceable,, employers, may, specify, in, the, offer, letter, that, the, employment, is, contingent, on, the, signing, of, the, non-competition, agreement,, in, which, case, there, is, valid, consideration., d),  that, the, agreement, is, not, harmful, to, the, public, or, the, employee., For, example,, in, an, area, that, has, a, shortage, of, providers, of, an, essential, service,, a, court, is, much, less, likely, to, enforce, a, non-competition, agreement, related, to, that, service., A, court, may, change, an, item, in, a, non-competition, agreement, to, a, value, that, is, more, reasonable., For, example,, the, court, may, shorten, the, duration, of, the, agreement., Such, changes, are, referred, to, a, "blue, penciling"., The, court, must, balance, the, interests, of, employers,, such, as, protection, against, damage, caused, by, competition,, with, the, interests, of, the, employees,, such, as, the, ability, to, earn, a, living., Some, states, have, statutes, specifying, things, that, are, not, enforceable., But, an, injunction, in, one, state, does, not, necessarily, prevent, one, from, competing, in, another, state., B., Non-Disparagement, agreement, -, prevents, the, employee, from, talking, negatively, about, the, employer., C., Non-Interference, agreement, -, prevents, the, employee, from, interfering, with, certain, relationships:, vendor/supplier, referral, patterns, customers, D., Non-solicitation, agreement, Non-solicitation, agreements, may, prevent:, solicitation, of, employees, to, attempt, to, steal, them, (but, the, employee, may, seek, out, your, firm, unless, otherwise, prevented), solicitation, of, customers, Under, general, tort, claims,, there, are:, wrongful, conversion, (theft), of, trade, secrets, -, there, have, been, cases, in, which, even, though, non-competes, had, not, been, signed,, companies, have, been, able, to, get, a, TRO, against, employees, who, were, going, to, a, competing, firm, when, it, was, inevitable, that, trade, secrets, would, have, been, disclosed., Under, the, inevitable, disclosure, doctrine,, an, employee, may, be, prevented, from, performing, work, in, competition, with, a, former, employer, if, a, court, decides, that, he, will, inevitably, disclose, trade, secrets, belonging, to, the, former, employer., tortuous, interference, with, contractual, relationships, Ten, issues, to, consider, when, hiring, a, competitor's, employees:, What, the, employee, had, been, doing, at, the, former, employer, -, are, there, some, potential, activities, in, the, new, role, that, should, be, off, limits?, The, nature, of, the, business, -, how, crucial, it, is, to, be, first, to, market,, is, the, market, in, a, particularly, highly, competitive, phase,, etc., Whether, the, companies, really, are, competing, -, even, though, they, may, be, in, the, same, industry,, if, there, is, little, product, overlap, then, the, risk, of, transferring, trade, secrets, is, lower., The, degree, of, competition, -, even, if, there, is, product, overlap,, a, move, from, a, weak, player, to, a, strong, player, may, not, be, a, problem,, unless, the, weaker, player, has, just, made, some, sort, of, a, breakthrough., Whether, the, employee, had, an, in-depth, knowledge, of, trade, secrets, or, just, general, exposure., Whether, the, former, employer, has, been, able, to, achieve, something, that, the, new, employer, has, tried, unsuccessfully, to, achieve., Whether, the, former, employer, took, adequate, precautions, to, protect, the, trade, secrets, in, question, -, otherwise, they, might, not, actually, be, trade, secrets., The, amount, of, discretion, that, the, employee, will, have, -, if, he, or, she, simply, is, implementing, a, pre-existing, plan, with, little, ability, to, change, it,, there, may, be, little, risk, of, doing, damage., Whether, the, employee, will, be, working, with, former, colleagues, at, the, new, employer, -, if, an, entire, team, is, assembled, and, this, team, once, had, knowledge, of, trade, secrets, at, the, former, employer,, there, is, greater, risk, of, disclosure, of, those, secrets., Whether, the, employee, will, receive, a, substantial, increase, in, salary, at, the, new, employer, -, if, so,, this, could, be, viewed, as, a, premium, for, the, trade, secrets., Employment, Law, Cases, Case: , Business, Intelligence, Services,, Inc., v., Carole, Hudson, Facts, Carole, Hudson, was, an, employee, of, Business, Intelligence, Services, (BIS)., In, August, of, 1983,, Ms., Hudson, received, an, employment, offer, from, Management, Technologies,, Inc., (MTI),, a, competing, firm., About, one-third, of, MTI's, employees, were, former, employees, of, BIS., Business, Intelligence, Services, (BIS), sought, an, injunction, to, prevent, Ms., Hudson, from, working, for, MTI., Ms., Hudson, believed, that, she, had, signed, an, employment, contract, with, BIS, in, June, 1983,, but, later, could, not, produce, a, copy, of, it., During, the, summer, of, 1983,, Ms., Hudson, had, received, a, promotion, at, BIS., On, September, 9,, 1983,, prior, to, Ms., Hudson's, resignation, from, BIS,, Ms., Hudson's, supervisor, at, BIS, told, her, that, there, was, no, employment, contract, on, file, for, her, and, that, such, a, contract, was, required., The, secretary, of, BIS's, president, approached, Ms., Hudson, with, a, contract, that, she, said, she, had, retyped., Without, reading, the, contract,, Ms., Hudson, signed, it., The, contract, had, a, non-compete, clause, in, it, prohibiting, Ms., Hudson, from, doing, business, with, any, of, BIS's, clients, for, a, period, 12, months, after, termination, of, her, employment., On, December, 29,, 1983,, Ms., Hudson, resigned, from, BIS., BIS, noted, the, non-competition, clause,, and, Ms., Hudson, expressed, her, view, that, the, contract, that, she, had, signed, in, June, had, no, such, clause., There, was, no, evidence, that, Ms., Hudson, would, be, unable, to, gain, employment, for, the, 12, month, non-compete, duration., Issue, The, issue, in, this, case, is, whether, the, non-competition, clause, was, enforcable., First,, it, may, have, been, misrepresented, since, it, had, been, presented, to, Ms., Hudson, as, a, retyped, version, of, the, original., Second,, since, the, new, contract, was, presented, after, the, commencement, of, employment, with, BIS,, there, is, a, question, of, whether, consideration, was, given., Holding, The, non-competition, clause, is, enforcable,, and, its, one-year, duration, is, reasonable., Reasoning, In, the, presentation, of, the, employment, contract, on, September, 9,, while, it, may, have, been, misrepresented,, there, is, no, evidence, of, intention, to, deceive., When, one, signs, something,, one, is, bound, by, its, terms, so, one, should, know, what, is, in, it., While, continued, employment, does, not, constitute, valid, consideration,, Ms., Hudson's, promotion, does., Furthermore,, BIS's, specific, knowledge, of, clients', systems, are, protectible, as, a, trade, secret., The, remedy, in, this, case, was, an, equitable, remedy, since, BIS, would, suffer, irreparable, harm, and, actual, damages, would, be, difficult, to, quantify., The, court, issued, a, preliminary, injunction, to, prevent, Ms., Hudson, from, commencing, employment, at, MTI., -----, Case: , Reed,, Roberts, Associates,, Inc.,, v., John, J., Strauman, Facts, Reed,, Roberts, track, the, employment, laws, in, 50, states, and, advises, companies, doing, business, in, those, states., John, Strauman, was, a, vice-president, of, Reed,, Roberts, who, had, signed, a, restrictive, covenant, indicating, that, he, would, not, solicit, any, of, the, firm's, clients, for, three, years, after, the, termination, of, he, employment., After, 11, years, with, Reed,, Roberts,, Mr., Strauman, resigned, and, formed, a, company, called, Curator, Associates,, Inc,, which, was, located, in, the, same, city, as, Reed,, Roberts, and, which, was, in, direct, competition, with, Reed,, Roberts., Issue, Enforceability, of, non-competition, and, non-solicitation., Holding, The, initial, court, ruled, that, the, non-solicitation, clause, was, enforceable, but, that, the, non-competition, clause, was, not., However,, the, court, of, appeal, ruled, that, neither, was, enforceable., Reasoning, The, lower, court, reasoned, that, the, non-competition, clause, was, not, enforceable, because, it, interfered, with, Mr., Strauman's, right, to, earn, a, living,, but, that, the, non-solicitation, clause, was, enforceable, because, it, would, be, unjust, for, Mr., Strauman, to, utilize, his, knowledge, of, Reed,, Roberts', internal, operations, to, solicit, its, clients., The, court, of, appeal, reasoned, that, the, solicitation, of, customers, usually, was, done, through, a, public, directory, such, as, Dun, and, Bradstreet's, Million, Dollar, Directory,, so, this, information, did, not, constitute, trade, secrets., -----, Case: , Structural, Dynamics, Research, Corporation, v., Engineering, Mechanics, Research, Corporation, Facts, Structural, Dynamics, Research, Corportation, (SDRC), and, Engineering, Mechanics, Research, Corporation, (EMRC), both, are, in, the, business, of, structural, analysis, and, testing., Kothawala,, Surana,, and, Hildebrand, were, former, employees, of, SDRC,, where, they, had, signed, confidentiality, agreements., Kothawala, and, Surana, had, developed, an, isoparametric, computer, program, in, their, roles, at, SDRC., Kothawala, left, SDRC, to, establish, EMRC, and, the, other, two, followed, him, shortly, thereafter., While, at, SDRC,, Kothawala, and, Hildebrand, had, sent, to, Ford, a, letter, that, criticized, SDRC, with, the, intent, to, transfer, the, Ford, business, to, their, new, company, once, they, left., Furthermore,, parts, of, EMRC's, computer, program, code, were, found, to, be, identical, to, those, of, SDRC's., Issue, Breach, of, trust,, breach, of, contractual, duty, not, to, use, or, disclose, confidential, information,, and, unfair, competion., Holding, The, court, did, not, enforce, the, non-competition, clause., The, former, employees, were, found, liable, for, SDRC's, loss, of, profits, from, Ford, due, to, Kothalwala's, and, Hildebrand's, disparaging, SDRC's, ability, to, complete, the, project., Due, to, unauthorized, use, of, SDRC's, confidential, information,, EMRC, was, liable, to, SDRC, in, the, amount, of, 15%, of, its, sales, for, the, next, three, years,, and, $45,000, in, damages, were, to, be, paid, to, SDRC., Reasoning, The, contract, was, entered, into, in, Ohio., The, Michigan, court, declared, it, enforceable, under, Ohio, law,, but, since, it, was, contrary, to, Michigan's, public, policy,, Michigan, refused, to, enforce, it., Surana, created, the, confidential, knowledge,, so, he, only, had, to, keep, it, confidential, while, employed, by, SDRC., The, case, was, a, close, one., What, tipped, the, scale, was, the, breach, of, trust, from, the, disparagement, of, SDRC, before, leaving, the, company., -----,   QuickMBA / Business, Law /, Employment, Law, Home  |  Site,
