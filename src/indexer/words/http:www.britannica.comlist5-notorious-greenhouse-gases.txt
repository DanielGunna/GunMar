Technology, List, 7, Deadliest, Weapons, in, History, ©, ixer/Shutterstock.com, Greenhouse, gases, are, a, hot, topic, (pun, intended), when, it, comes, to, global, warming., These, gases, absorb, heat, energy, emitted, from, Earth’s, surface, and, reradiate, it, back, to, the, ground., In, this, way,, they, contribute, to, the, greenhouse, effect,, which, keeps, the, planet, from, losing, all, of, its, heat, from, the, surface, at, night., The, concentrations, of, various, greenhouse, gases, in, the, atmosphere, determine, how, much, heat, is, absorbed, by, the, atmosphere, and, reradiated, back, to, the, surface., Human, activities—especially, fossil-fuel, combustion, since, the, Industrial, Revolution—are, responsible, for, steady, increases, in, the, concentration, of, greenhouse, gases, in, the, atmosphere., The, five, most, significant, gases, are, presented, here., Water, vapor, Encyclopædia, Britannica,, Inc., Water, vapor, is, the, most, potent, of, the, greenhouse, gases, in, Earth’s, atmosphere,, and, it’s, sort, of, a, unique, player, among, the, greenhouse, gases., The, amount, of, water, vapor, in, the, atmosphere, cannot,, in, general,, be, directly, modified, by, human, behavior—it’s, set, by, air, temperatures., The, warmer, the, surface,, the, greater, the, evaporation, rate, of, water, from, the, surface., As, a, result,, increased, evaporation, leads, to, a, greater, concentration, of, water, vapor, in, the, lower, atmosphere, capable, of, absorbing, infrared, radiation, and, emitting, it, downward., Carbon, dioxide, ©, Sergiy, Serdyuk/Fotolia, Of, the, greenhouse, gases,, carbon, dioxide, (CO2), is, the, most, prominent., Sources, of, atmospheric, CO2, include, volcanoes,, the, combustion, and, decay, of, organic, matter,, respiration, by, aerobic, (oxygen-using), organisms,, and, the, burning, of, fossil, fuels,, clearing, of, land,, and, production, of, cement, by, humans., These, sources, are, balanced,, on, average,, by, a, set, of, physical,, chemical,, or, biological, processes,, called, "sinks,", that, tend, to, remove, CO2, from, the, atmosphere., Plant, life,, which, takes, up, CO2, during, the, process, of, photosynthesis,, is, an, important, natural, sink., In, the, oceans,, marine, life, can, absorb, dissolved, CO2,, and, some, marine, organisms, even, use, CO2, to, build, skeletons, and, other, structures, made, of, calcium, carbonate, (CaCO3)., Methane, ©, Photos.com/Jupiterimages, Methane, (CH4), is, the, second, most, important, greenhouse, gas., It, is, more, potent, than, CO2,, but, exists, in, far, lower, concentrations, in, the, atmosphere., CH4, also, hangs, around, in, the, atmosphere, for, a, shorter, time, than, CO2—the, residence, time, for, CH4, is, roughly, 10, years,, compared, with, hundreds, of, years, for, CO2., Natural, sources, of, methane, include, many, wetlands,, methane-oxidizing, bacteria, that, feed, on, organic, material, consumed, by, termites,, volcanoes,, seepage, vents, of, the, seafloor, in, regions, rich, with, organic, sediment,, and, methane, hydrates, trapped, along, the, continental, shelves, of, the, oceans, and, in, polar, permafrost., The, primary, natural, sink, for, methane, is, the, atmosphere, itself;, another, natural, sink, is, soil,, where, methane, is, oxidized, by, bacteria., As, with, CO2,, human, activity, is, increasing, the, CH4, concentration, faster, than, it, can, be, offset, by, natural, sinks., Human, sources, (rice, cultivation,, livestock, farming,, the, burning, of, coal, and, natural, gas,, biomass, combustion,, and, decomposition, in, landfills), currently, account, for, approximately, 70, percent, of, total, annual, emissions,, leading, to, substantial, increases, in, concentration, over, time., Surface-level, ozone, Johnny, Stockshooter—age, fotostock/Imagestate, The, next, most, significant, greenhouse, gas, is, surface,, or, low-level,, ozone, (O3)., Surface, O3, is, a, result, of, air, pollution;, it, must, be, distinguished, from, naturally, occurring, stratospheric, O3,, which, has, a, very, different, role, in, the, planetary, radiation, balance., The, primary, natural, source, of, surface, O3, is, the, subsidence, of, stratospheric, O3, from, the, upper, atmosphere, toward, Earth’s, surface., In, contrast,, the, primary, human-driven, source, of, surface, O3, is, in, photochemical, reactions, involving, carbon, monoxide, (CO),, such, as, in, smog., Nitrous, oxides, and, fluorinated, gases, ©, Mikael, Damkier/Shutterstock.com, Additional, trace, gases, produced, by, industrial, activity, that, have, greenhouse, properties, include, nitrous, oxide, (N2O), and, fluorinated, gases, (halocarbons)., The, latter, includes, sulfur, hexafluoride,, hydrofluorocarbons, (HFCs),, and, perfluorocarbons, (PFCs)., Nitrous, oxides, have, small, background, concentrations, due, to, natural, biological, reactions, in, soil, and, water,, whereas, the, fluorinated, gases, owe, their, existence, almost, entirely, to, industrial, sources., Previous, List, 5, Mysteries, of, Jupiter, That, Juno, Might, Solve, Next, List, 10, Places, to, Visit, in, the, Solar, System, More, Science,
