[New!, Research, Tools, Columns, Box, Office, BOP, Blogs, Site, Info, Misc, The, Case, of, the, Swapped, Sleuths, August, 13,, 2002, Will, the, real, Perry, Mason, please, stand, up?, How, about, the, real, Philo, Vance?, And, which, Michael, Lanyard, (Lone, Wolf, to, most, movie, fans), was, best?, At, least, there's, not, much, argument, about, Nick, Charles,, played, by, William, Powell, in, all, the, Thin, Man, features,, or, Boston, Blackie,, personified, by, Chester, Morris, in, all, those, Columbia, programs, of, the, 1940s., And, then,, of, course,, there's, the, strange, tale, of, two, Lawrence, brothers,, Gay, and, Tom..., If, there's, one, thing, all, these, crime-fighting, characters, had, in, common, (with, the, exception, of, the, more, down-to-earth, Blackie),, it, was, a, sly, urbanity, coupled, with, a, dry, wit, and, a, penchant, for, even, drier, martinis., Those, who, grew, up, with, Raymond, Burr's, stolid, but, dull, Perry, Mason, might, be, surprised, by, the, 1930s, B, films, featuring, the, same, character., None, of, the, others, -, Vance,, Lone, Wolf,, or, The, Falcon, -, made, it, out, of, the, '50s, and, have, faded, from, view, in, pop, culture., But, during, the, '30s,, these, films, were, reliable, and, popular, staples, for, their, respective, studios:, Vance, for, Paramount,, Warner, Bros, and, PRC,, Lone, Wolf, (Michael, Lanyard), at, Columbia, and, The, Falcon, (otherwise, known, as, the, brothers, Lawrence), at, RKO., Watch, enough, Turner, Classic, Movies, and, you'll, soon, become, familiar, with, the, characters., You'll, also, get, very, confused,, as, a, select, group, of, actors, switched, back, and, forth, between, the, same, roles!, William, Powell, is, best, remembered, today, as, Nick, Charles,, husband, of, Nora, (Myrna, Loy),, master, of, Asta,, and, father, of, Nick,, Jr., (played, by, Dean, Stockwell, in, the, series', lamentable, last, entry, in, 1947)., But, Powell, had, honed, his, suave, comedic, skills, in, the, role, of, S.S., Van, Dine's, Philo, Vance, in, four, excellent, mystery, features, between, 1929, and, 1933., It's, likely, that, Powell's, performances, as, Vance, were, noted, by, the, talent, scouts, at, MGM,, who, wooed, the, actor, from, the, grittier, confines, of, Warner, Bros., shortly, after, The, Kennel, Murder, Case, in, 1933., Looking, to, watch, the, latest, movies, on, a, brand, new, television?, Our, selection, of, LCD, TVs, will, have, you, watching, films, on, the, big, screen, in, no, time!, Warner, needed, a, replacement, for, the, Vance, series,, and, found, one, in-house, in, the, person, of, the, equally-talented, and, long-forgotten, Warren, William., William, had, played, Perry, Mason, for, the, Bros., in, The, Case, of, the, Howling, Dog,, and, immediately, moved, over, to, the, Vance, role, for, The, Dragon, Murder, Case., William, bore, a, physical, resemblance, to, Powell,, down, to, the, receding, hairline, and, pencil-thin, moustache., He, spoke, with, the, same, smooth, British, stage, accent,, no, doubt, acquired, by, the, Minnesota-born, actor, during, his, time, at, the, American, Academy, of, Dramatic, Arts, (Powell, had, also, been, a, stage, actor, since, 1912)., William, was, usually, more, the, rake, and, less, the, gentleman, than, Powell,, but, he, fit, the, role, well., Warner, obviously, preferred, him, as, Mason,, however,, as, he, returned, to, play, the, world's, most, famous, lawyer, three, more, times, in, the, next, two, years,, and, wouldn't, return, to, play, Vance, until, 1939, in, the, unfortunately-titled, Gracie, Allen, Murder, Case., In, the, interim,, Paul, Lukas,, Edmund, Lowe,, and, Grant, Richards, each, essayed, the, role, once., Yorkshireman, James, Stephenson, acquitted, himself, reasonably, well, in, 1940's, Calling, Philo, Vance,, and, then, the, character, petered, out, on, Poverty, Row,, as, the, dull, Alan, Curtis, completed, the, cycle, with, two, late-'40s, bill-fillers, for, PRC., William, moved, on, from, playing, Vance, to, playing, Michael, Lanyard,, the, Lone, Wolf,, a, character, created, by,, believe, it, or, not,, one, Louis, Joseph, Vance!, The, character, first, reached, the, screen, in, 1917's, The, Lone, Wolf,, played, by, Bert, Lytell., Except, for, a, brief, break, for, 1919's, The, False, Face,, where, Lanyard, was, played, by, Henry, B., Walthall,, the, star, of, D.W., Griffith's, magnificent, and, controversial, Birth, of, a, Nation,, Lytell, played, the, Wolf, periodically, until, the, end, of, the, silent, era., The, character, languished, unused, until, 1935,, when, yet, another, actor, with, a, pencil-thin, moustache,, Melvyn, Douglas,, stepped, in, for, a, one-off., Douglas, was, followed, by, the, great, Hungarian, actor,, Francis, Lederer,, for, one, film,, and, then, William, arrived, on, the, scene., The, transition, from, Vance, to, Lanyard, was, a, smooth, one,, as, William, basically, played, the, two, characters, identically., William, made, nine, Lone, Wolf, features, for, Columbia,, until, his, declining, health, led, to, the, studio, replacing, him, with, the, less-attractive, and, less-skilled, Gerald, Mohr., The, series, started, to, peter, out, and, after, one, last, gasp, in, 1949, with, Australian, Ron, Randell,, the, Lone, Wolf, was, done., And, then, there's, the, Falcon., George, Sanders, was, a, refined, Englishman, who, first, brought, Leslie, Charteris', character,, Simon, Templar, (AKA, The, Saint),, to, the, screen, in, a, series, of, RKO, actioners., Sanders, filled, the, Saint's, shoes, for, five, average-but-entertaining, films, before, RKO, developed, the, character, of, Gay, Lawrence., Yes,, that, is, the, character's, name., Created, by, Michael, Arlen,, the, Hollywood, nom, de, plume, of, a, Bulgarian, immigrant, born, Dikran, Kuyumjian,, the, Falcon, would, have, a, relatively, long, screen, life,, extending, into, the, late, '40s., Gay, was, witty,, urbane,, and,, of, course,, a, dedicated, ladies', man., Sanders, fit, the, role, magnificently,, but, his, star, was, on, the, rise, in, Tinsel, Town,, and, he, was, soon, on, the, move, to, the, more, upscale, Fox., RKO, knew, the, Falcon, was, a, winner,, though,, so, in, the, series', fourth, entry, a, convenient, brother,, Tom, Lawrence,, was, introduced, to, replace, Gay., And, who, was, chosen, to, play, this, character?, None, other, than, Tom, Conway,, the, real-life, brother, of, George, Sanders., Conway, was, a, carbon, copy, of, his, brother,, with, all, the, requisite, burdens:, he, wasn't, quite, as, handsome, and, he, wasn't, quite, as, good, an, actor., But, he, was, good, enough, to, keep, the, series, rolling, along, for, another, ten, films, before, RKO, dropped, the, curtain, on, the, Lawrence, brothers., Not, to, be, deterred,, the, character, of, the, Falcon, continued, for, three, more, pictures, at, the, eponymous, Falcon, Pictures,, where, a, completely, new, actor,, the, otherwise-unheralded, John, Calvert,, played, a, new, Falcon,, now, called, Michael, Waring., These, films, are, pale, imitations, indeed, of, the, RKO, series,, and, really, can't, be, recommended, to, any, but, the, most, devout, of, film, fans., These, characters,, all, basically, good, men, with, a, taste, for, women, and, the, high, life,, lost, favor, in, the, post-war, period., America, was, coming, to, grips, with, the, problems, of, the, Cold, War, and, harder, men, were, needed, to, confront, harder, problems:, Communism,, juvenile, delinquency,, and, race, relations., Mike, Hammer, became, America's, two-fisted, PI,, a, man, who, was, more, likely, to, bed, his, lady, friends, than, to, regale, them, with, witty, banter., The, era, of, the, suave,, sophisticated, amateur, investigator, was, over., The, films,, of, course,, are, now, staples, on, Turner, Classic, Movies,, in, the, way, they, were, once, staples, of, the, movie, palace;, bottom-of-the-bill, fare, that, fills, scheduling, gaps, and, provides, an, hour, or, so, of, painless, and, pleasant, entertainment., So, hoist, your, highball,, and, salute, those, masters, of, the, martini, and, the, actors, who, brought, them, to, the, big, and, small, screens., They, may, be, gone,, but, they're, surely, not, forgotten.,      ,  ,  , Need,
