[A, Beginner's, Guide, to, Modal, Harmony, The, kind, of, harmony, taught, in, most, university, music, courses, deals, with, what, is, known, as, the, "common, practice", era,, i.e.,, the, kind, of, things, that, most, composers, did, in, the, period, approximately, 1650-1850., After, 1850,, composers, started, to, experiment, more, with, harmony., But, traditional, Irish, and, Scottish, music, has, been, more, conservative, than, classical, music;, it, tends, to, stick, with, the, kind, of, harmony, used, before, 1650,, which, is, modal, harmony., The, use, of, the, modal, system, provides, great, advantages, in, the, analysis, of, traditional, music., Lest, you, think, I'm, making, all, this, up,, here's, a, quotation, from, the, well-known, London-based, fiddler, Peter, Cooper:, Anyone, familiar, with, written, violin, music, but, not, with, folk, music, may, be, perplexed, by, some, of, the, key, signatures, used., This, is, because, Irish, tunes, are, not, constructed, within, the, diatonic, (major, and, minor), idiom, of, classical, music, but, in, the, older, system, of, modes., It, is, not, necessary, to, understand, the, theory, of, modes, to, play, the, tunes, and, you, may, prefer, to, skip, this, section., But, four, modes, are, used, in, Irish, music,, two, that, sound, 'major',, two, that, sound, 'minor'., They, are, called, the, Ionian,, Mixolydian,, Dorian, and, Aeolian, modes, and, correspond, to, the, scales, you'd, get, if, you, played, only, the, white, notes, of, a, piano,, starting, on, C,, G,, D, and, A, respectively., The, Ionian, mode, sounds, exactly, the, same, as, the, major, scale, and, is, the, most, common, -, over, half, the, tunes, here, are, in, the, Ionian, mode., The, Mixolydian, mode, resembles, the, Ionian, but, includes, a, minor, seventh., Tom, Billy's, Jig,, for, example,, is, in, the, Mixolydian, mode, of, A, and, has, a, G, natural, instead, of, G#., Its, key, signature, -, two, sharps, -, does, not, indicate, the, key, of, D, major., The, Dorian, and, Aeolian, modes, are, alike, in, having, a, minor, third,, but, are, distinguished, by, having, a, major, and, minor, sixth, respectively., Cooley's, Reel,, for, example,, is, in, the, Dorian, mode, of, E, and, has, two, sharps,, F#, and, C3., The, Rights, of, Man, is, in, the, Aeolian, mode, of, E, and,, with, a, C, natural, instead, of, a, C#, as, its, sixth,, has, a, single, sharp, as, its, key, signature., Peter, Cooper, Mel, Bay's, Complete, Irish, Fiddle, Player, Mel, Bay, Publications,, 1995, pp., 19-20, Since, the, historical, background, is, interesting,, I'll, give, a, short, sketch, of, how, modes, came, into, use., Then, I'll, give, a, brief, introduction, to, the, modal, harmonic, system, as, used, during, the, Renaissance,, which, is, still, in, use, today, in, traditional, Scottish, and, Irish, music., The, modal, system, derives, from, ecclesiastical, chant., In, the, late, 4th, century,, Ambrose,, Bishop, of, Milan,, defined, four, modes,, to, which, he, gave, numbers., The, nature, of, each, mode, is, defined, by, the, position, of, the, semitones, in, the, scale:, Ambrosian, Modes, 1st, tone, d, e, f, g, a, b, c, d, 2nd, tone, e, f, g, a, b, c, d, e, 3rd, tone, f, g, a, b, c, d, e, f, 4th, tone, g, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, This, system, was, modified, under, the, direction, of, Pope, Gregory, (Pope, in, the, period, 590-604), by, increasing, the, number, of, modes, to, eight., The, four, additional, modes, were, produced, by, starting, each, of, the, Ambrosian, modes, a, fourth, lower,, so, that, the, keynote, appeared, in, the, middle, of, the, scale., The, four, ancient, modes, were, called, authentic;, the, new, modes, were, called, plagal:, Gregorian, Modes, 1st, tone, Authentic, De, f, g, a, b, c, d, 2nd, tone, Plagal, a, b, c, D, e, f, g, a, 3rd, tone, Authentic, E, f, g, a, b, c, d, e, 4th, tone, Plagal, b, c, d, E, f, g, a, b, 5th, tone, Authentic, F, g, a, b, c, d, e, f, 6th, tone, Plagal, c, d, e, F, g, a, b, c, 7th, tone, Authentic, G, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, 8th, tone, Plagal, d, e, f, G, a, b, c, d, This, was, the, system, specified, for, the, Gregorian, chant., Around, 1020,, the, monk, Guido, of, Arezzo, gave, names, to, the, notes, based, on, the, first, syllables, of, each, line, in, the, Hymn, for, St., John, the, Baptist's, day, (composed, by, Paul, the, Deacon, c., 774):, UT, queant, laxis, REsonare, fibris, MIra, gestorum, FAmuli, tuorum:, SOLve, polluti,, LAbii, reatum,, Sancte, Johannes, SI, as, the, name, for, the, 7th, degree, of, the, scale, was, not, agreed, upon, until, the, late, 1600s., The, use, of, DO, in, place, of, UT, was, proposed, in, 1673, by, Giovanni, Maria, Bonocini;, it, has, not, been, universally, adopted, to, this, day., As, can, be, seen, from, the, table, above,, Gregorian, chant, used, only, what, we, would, now, think, of, as, the, white, notes, of, the, piano., Chant, consists, of, only, a, single, melodic, line., But, as, polyphony, developed, through, the, Middle, Ages,, the, tritone, interval, between, B, and, F, became, a, problem., This, was, solved, by, the, introduction, of, B, flat,, which, originally, was, not, thought, to, be, a, different, note,, as, we, do, today,, but, as, a, modification, of, the, original, note, B., As, time, passed,, additional, modifications, were, allowed, (although, the, strict, church, system, still, allowed, only, B, flat)., This, gave, rise, to, modes, that, could, not, be, described, using, the, original, Gregorian, system., The, system, we, use, today, is, based, on, the, compositional, practice, of, the, Renaissance, period., In, the, 16th, century, Glareanus, assigned, Greek, names, to, each, of, the, existing, modes., (These, names, are, not, connected, to, any, system, actually, in, use, in, ancient, Greece.), The, distinction, of, plagal, and, authentic, has, been, abandoned., The, Renaissance, system, was, as, follows:, Renaissance, Modes, Mode, Name, Notes, Scale, pattern, Ionian, c, d, e, f, g, a, b, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, Dorian, d, e, f, g, a, b, c, 1, 2, -3, 4, 5, 6, -7, Phrygian, e, f, g, a, b, c, d, 1, -2, -3, 4, 5, -6, 7, Lydian, f, g, a, b, c, d, e, 1, 2, 3, +4, 5, 6, 7, Mixolydian, g, a, b, c, d, e, f, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, -7, Aeolian, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, 1, 2, -3, 4, 5, -6, -7, Locrian, b, c, d, e, f, g, a, 1, -2, -3, 4, -5, -6, -7, Thus,, with, a, key, signature, of, no, flats, or, sharps,, seven, possible, modes,, or, scale, patterns,, can, be, represented., (In, fact,, because, the, fifth, degree, of, the, scale, is, not, perfect,, the, Locrian, mode, is, of, theoretical, interest, onlyit, has, rarely, been, used, in, practice.), Of, course,, any, starting, note, can, be, chosenevery, key, signature, can, generate, seven, possible, modes., In, the, Renaissance,, however,, not, all, notes, would, have, been, allowed, as, starting, notes., Next, the, same, table, is, given, with, the, starting, note, being, C, in, each, case., Now, each, mode, starting, on, C, will, have, a, different, key, signature., Renaissance, Modes,, C, starting, pitch, Mode, Name, Notes, Scale, pattern, Key,

Eb F Gb Ab Bb, 1, -2, -3, 4, -5, -6, -7, Bb, Eb, Ab, Db, Gb, In, traditional, music,, the, most, commonly, used, modes, are, the, Ionian,, Dorian,, and, Mixolydian., The, Aeolian, mode, is, not, uncommon;, the, Lydian, and, Phrygian, modes, are, extremely, rare., The, Locrian, is, never, used., In, the, Baroque, period, of, music,, all, modes, except, the, Ionian, and, Aeolian, were, discarded., These, were, then, renamed, the, major, and, minor, scale., However,, in, actual, use,, the, minor, scale, is, often, modified, by, the, use, of, a, raised, 7th, degree, leading, tone., This, usage, derives, from, the, medieval, and, Renaissance, use, of, musica, fictathese, were, adjustments, made, to, certain, notes, (what, we, now, know, as, accidentals), to, avoid, forbidden, harmonic, relations, such, as, the, tritone,, or, for, other, reasons, dealing, with, vertical, harmonic, relationships., Since, traditional, music, consists, of, a, single, melodic, line, only,, without, harmony,, musica, ficta, was, never, used., Hence, raised, leading, tones, in, the, Dorian, and, Aeolian, modes, are, never, encountered., A, large, portion, of, the, stock, of, traditional, tunes, seems, to, have, originated, in, the, 18th, century., These, tunes, almost, always, stay, in, a, single, mode., Tunes, composed, in, the, 19th, century,, however,, sometimes, change, modes., For, example,, Chief, O'Neill's, Favourite, Hornpipe, is, in, D, Ionian,, except, for, measures, 3-4, of, the, A, section,, which, are, in, D, Mixolydian,, and, the, first, four, bars, of, the, B, section,, which, change, to, a, D, Dorian., This, is, a, slightly, unusual, case,, but, similar, modal, changes, are, encountered, in, other, tunes, from, the, nineteenth, century., It, was, not, until, the, early, 20th, century, that, researchers, in, traditional, music, realized, that, traditional, music, used, Renaissance, modes., The, pioneering, work, of, the, likes, of, Cecil, Sharp, and, Ralph, Vaughan, Williams, was, greeted, with, statements, along, the, lines, of, "How, can, you, tell, me, that, these, ignorant, peasants, are, singing, in, the, Mixolydian, mode, when, some, of, our, finest, music, professors, don't, even, know, what, it, is?", However,, the, fact, is, now, generally, accepted, by, ethnomusicologists., The, interesting, research, area, has, moved, on, to, the, examination, of, how,, in, certain, circumstances,, some, degrees, of, a, mode, can, be, modified, by, intervals, less, than, a, semitone., (This, is, a, feature, mostly, found, in, the, playing, of, older, musiciansthe, influence, of, mainstream, equally-tempered, music, is, driving, this, artistic, device, into, oblivion.), Some, Irish, tunes, are, constructed, on, gapped, scales., They, have, only, six, rather, than, the, usual, seven, different, notes, within, an, octave., The, third, is, missing,, for, instance,, from, The, Walls, of, Liscarroll, while, Brian, Boru's, March, lacks, the, sixth, and, both, have, a, rather, archaic, sound., Another, very, ancient, feature, of, the, scales, used, in, some, Irish, music, is, the, inclusion, of, 'half-sharp', notesquarter, tones, mid-way, between, natural, and, sharp., Peter, Cooper, Mel, Bay's, Complete, Irish, Fiddle, Player, Mel, Bay, Publications,, 1995, p., 20, Nineteenth-century, editions, of, traditional, music, frequently, "corrected", tunes, by, adding, sharpened, leading, tones,, changing, Dorian, mode, to, Aeolian, mode,, etc., Hence,, such, sources, should, be, regarded, as, suspect., Eighteenth-century, collections, appear, to, be, fairly, reliable;, if, the, tune, has, lasted, into, modern, times,, it, usually, is, fairly, close, to, the, eighteenth-century, setting., Otherwise,, a, setting, collected, in, the, twentieth, century, is, preferable., The, use, of, the, modal, system, is, particularly, convenient, in, the, matter, of, key, signatures., For, example,, when, writing, an, A, minor, tune, in, a, key, signature, of, no, sharps, or, flats,, if, it, is, noticed, that, every, occurence, of, an, F, has, been, sharped,, it, should, be, concluded, that, the, tune, is, in, the, mode, of, A, Dorian, rather, than, A, Aeolian., This, can, be, reflected, by, placing, an, F#, in, the, key, signature;, the, avoidance, of, unnecessary, accidentals, is, a, convenience, both, to, the, transcriber, and, to, the, performer., Some, editors, place, natural, signs, in, the, key, signature, of, Dorian, and, Mixolydian, mode, tunes,, e.g.,, a, B, natural, for, the, D, Dorian, mode, or, a, G, natural, for, A, Mixolydian., The, sole, function, of, this, is, to, reassure, performers, who, are, unfamiliar, with, modal, notation, that, this, is, indeed, what, is, intended., It, should, be, noted,, however,, that, in, Scottish, music,, the, "Northeast", style, in, particular, has, been, influenced, by, a, number, of, classically, trained, performers,, the, most, renowned, of, which, are, William, Marshall, and, J., Scott, Skinner., This, particular, style, features, a, greater, use, of, the, major/minor, tonal, system,, although, Mixolydian, tunes, are, still, quite, common., Other, features, are, the, use, of, classical, bowing, techniques, such, as, staccato, and, spiccato,, and, classical-type, changes, in, dynamics., Modern, performers, in, this, style, usually, use, a, constant, Kreisler-style, vibrato., This, is, undoubtedly, a, modern, innovationit, is, hardly, likely, that, traditional, fiddlers, were, using, a, constant, vibrato, before, the, classical, violinists, started, to!, In, fact,, this, can, be, confirmed, by, recordings., Marshall, lived, before, the, invention, of, recording,, but, J., Scott, Skinner, (1843-1927), recorded, extensively, between, 1899, and, 1922., His, playing, is, very, interesting,, mixing, classical, bowing, styles,, portamento, and, position, playing, with, a, traditionally, ornamented, style, reminiscent, of, Cape, Breton, fiddling., He, uses, almost, no, vibrato, at, all,, just, like, classical, violinists, of, the, late, 19th, century., The, "Northeast", style, has, been, promulgated, mostly, through, written, music,, rather, than, by, ear, like, most, traditional, music., Thus, today's, performers, in, this, style, follow, conventional, 20th, century, stylistic, norms,, rather, than, attempting, to, recreate, the, composer's, intentions,, as, documented, on, his, recordings., But, to, be, fair,, why, should, Skinner, receive, any, better, treatment, than, is, given, to, Brahms, or, Schubert,, whose, works, are, similarly, modified, by, modern, performers?, The, use, of, major/minor, tonality, in, this, one, particular, context, is, likely, to, be, correct, as, far, as, the, intentions, of, the, composer, are, concerned., However,, if, such, tunes, achieve, any, popularity, among, traditional, fiddlers,, as, some, of, Marshall's, and, Skinner's, have, done,, they, are, usually, modified, into, a, modal, tonality., Other, regional, Scottish, styles, have, never, adopted, any, of, these, classical, performance, devices,, or, the, major/minor, harmonic, system;, the, same, is, true, of, all, regional, Irish, traditionsexcepting, only, the, one-man, "tradition", of, Seán, Maguire!, Jack, Campin's, tutorial, on, the, modes, of, Scottish, traditional, music., Here's, a, bit, of, the, intro:, The, descriptions, of, scales, in, music, textbooks, oriented, towards, Western, art, music, usually, give, a, misleading, idea, of, the, way, they, are, used, in, Scottish, traditional, tunes., This, document, is, intended, to, help, Scottish, traditional, musicians, undo, some, of, the, damage, done, by, high-school, music, teachers, while, not, taking, off, into, irrelevant, side-issues., All, the, theory, here, is, illustrated, by, some, real, Scottish, music., Patricia, Vivien, Yarrow's, A, Brief, Introduction, to, Modes, in, Early, and,
