[Mantronix, /, Kurtis, Mantronik, Kraftwerk, HackForce7, www.CheebaDesign.com, online, since, 1996, Contact, :, runeleknes@hotmail.com, Fresh, is, the, word, updated, December, 11,, 2014, NOVEMBER, 25,, 2014, :, The, New, album, from, KURTIS, MANTRONIK, “Journey, To, Utopia”, PRE-ORDER, BUTTON, LIVE, NOW, -, http://www.streetsounds.co/journey_to_utopia.php, The, first, 100, CDs, personally, signed, by, the, great, man, himself!, Mantronik, &, Mc, Tee, was, a, part, of, one, of, the, most, inovative, hip, hop, groups, in, the, 80's, combining, Rap,, Funk,, Reggae,, Pop&, Electronics...Mantronix, still, make, many, of, todays, hip, hop, artists, look, like, their, making, elevator, music!!, In, my, opinion, Mantronix, is, the, way, hip, hop, was, supposed, to, be, in, the, 90's...Raw,, Cool,, Independent, &, Hardcore!!, Mantronik's, real, name, is, Kurtis, Khaleel, (born, September, 4,, 1965), &, Mc, Tee's, real, name, is, Tooure, Embden., Mantronix, was, formed, in, New, York, in, 1984., William, Socolov,, the, head, of, the, independent, record, label, "Sleeping, bag, Records", heard, a, Mantronix, demo, tape, and, a, few, months, later, "Fresh, is, the, Word", hit, the, streets, in, 1985, with, a, blast!!, Their, second, single, was, "Bassline", from, their, debut, "The, album", in, 1986, which, probably, is, one, of, the, coolest, and, rawest, hip, hop, albums, ever, made., Bassline, was, the, first, single, to, hit, the, charts, outside, america..well, that's, when, i, heard, them, for, the, first, time, and, since, then, i've, been, captivated, by, their, unique, sound., Later, the, same, year, they, released, "Music, madness",, also, a, great, album,, though, some, people, think, they, was, in, a, holding, pattern,, i, disagree., In, 1988, they, released, "In, full, effect", which, also, was, a, fine, piece, of, work,, but, you, could, hear, the, comercialised, sound, beginning, to, grow., After, that, record,, the, cool, Mantronix, sound, they, had, made, since, "The, album", in, 1986, was, gone.Mantronik, was, unfortunaly, aiming, his, music, in, a, more, commercial, way., A, more, soul/dance, kind, of, shit., MC, Tee, left, the, group, in, 1988,, i, don't, know, the, reason, but, i've, heard, reports, that, they, didn't, get, along, well., At, the, same, time, Mantronix, left, Sleeping, Bag, Records, for, Capitol., The, group, was, joined, by, rapper, Bryce, Wilson, and, was, touring, with, Mantronix, when, they, promote, the, album, "In, Full, Effect"., Bryce, is, now, with, the, group, "Groove, Theory", which, has, been, rather, succesful., The, single, "Tell, me", hit, the, Top, 3, on, the, R&B, charts, in, america, and, Top, 10, in, the, pop, chart, in, Canada., He, has, also, worked, with, Toni, Braxton,, En, Vogue,, Mary, J.Blige, to, name, a, few., In, a, interview, Bryce, said, about, working, with, Mantronik, :, "I, learned, alot, from, watching, Kurtis, in, the, studio,, he, was, the, best, producer, i've, ever, met,, and, his, attitude, reflected, that., I, had, to, quit, though,, cause, he, had, me, thinking, -, black, piece, of, shit, -, was, my, new, name!!"., whatever, that, means......There, was, a, gap, between, MC, Tee, &, Bryce, joining, when, Mantronix, was, making, the, video, for, "Join, Me, Please"., In, the, video, Mantronik, is, pretending, to, rap, and, believe, me, it, looks, awful,, but, who, can, blame, him...someone, had, to, do, it, :-)., In, the, early, 90's, after, making, moderate, success, with, his, dance, /, club, tracks, "Step, to, Me", &, "Take, your, Time", sung, by, Jade, Trini,, Mantronik, dissapeared., He, made, some, remixes, &, he, did, work, on, new, tracks,, but, it, was, very, underground, and, i, did, never, hear, much, about, him, in, that, period., It, was, first, when, i, got, the, internet, that, i, discovered, that, he, was, still, active., He, made, some, really, cool, Techno, /, breakbeat, tracks, on, some, very, hard, to, get, EP's, ., Bassmachine, re-tuned, which, is, a, remix, of, T.LA., Rock's, old, classic, hip, hop, track, &, Music, for, the, dusted,, both, 1997., And, he, had, taken, the, name, Kurtis, Mantronik, instead, of, Mantronix., He, has, recently, released, a, new, album, called, "I, Sing, the, Body, Electro"(september, 1,, 1998).., It's, a, blend, of, alot, of, things, but, i, just, like, to, put, the, cute, name, Electronica, to, it., Mantronik, has, been, joined, by, female, rapper, Traylude,, a, girl, i, don't, know, anything, about, yet., Carlos, Alomar, whos, guitar, can, be, heard, on, many, of, the, tracks, on, the, album, including, Mad,, push, yer, hands, up, &, one, time, feel, fine, are, a, very, experienced, musician., Carlos, Alomar, is, best, known, as, the, guitarist, for, David, Bowie, on, such, albums, as, Young, Americans, and, Station, to, Station., He, was, Bowie's, musical, director, on, the, Glass, Spider, Tour, in, 1987., He, has, worked, with, such, artists, as, :, Iggy, Pop,, Yoko, Ono,, Simple, Minds,, Paul, McCartney,, Pretenders, &, Cyndi, Lauper., Mr., Bush, who, did, the, vocals, on, the, album, is, a, member, of, the, group, "D-Note"., Kurtis, Mantronik, has, said, that, he, won't, make, hip, hop, anymore,, that, don't, bother, me, as, long, as, the, sutff, he, makes, now, is, good, material., But, the, incredible, and, inovative, "The, Album"&, "Music, Madness", will, always, be, in, a, league, of, their, own!!!, DISCOGRAPHY, Mantronix, albums, :, The, Album, (1985), "Vinyl", -, Sleeping, Bag, Records, The,
