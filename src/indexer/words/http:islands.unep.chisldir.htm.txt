September, 2004, INTRODUCTION, AND, EXPLANATION, Islands, have, long, been, noted, for, their, unique, fauna, and, flora, which, are, particularly, vulnerable, to, disturbance, and, destruction, by, human, activities. , They, are, also, of, interest, for, the, special, adaptations, of, island, societies,, the, difficulties, of, economic, development, in, an, island, context,, and, the, challenge, of, achieving, sustainable, development, within, limited, island, resources. , With, the, increasing, rate, of, global, change,, islands, represent, some, of, the, most, fragile, and, vulnerable, resources, on, the, planet., This, Island, Directory, assembles, information, on, the, significant, islands, of, the, world. , It, is, intended, to, help, those, living, on, islands, or, involved, in, island, development, and, conservation, to, understand, the, environmental, problems, of, islands,, to, identify, islands, with, special, problems, or, under, particular, threat,, and, to, compare, and, classify, islands, globally, to, show, which, islands, may, share, common, problems, and, be, able, to, cooperate, in, solving, those, problems., General, Description, and, Criteria, for, Inclusion, This, Island, Directory, provides, an, annotated, list, of, nearly, 2,000, of, the, significant, islands, of, the, world. , Several, criteria, were, used, to, determine, how, much, detail, is, provided, for, the, selected, islands. , Islands, over, 17,000, square, kilometres, are, too, large, to, summarize, in, this, directory, format;, each, should, have, a, book, in, itself,, and, receives, only, cursory, treatment, here. , Only, oceanic, islands, are, included;, those, occurring, in, freshwater, bodies, have, not, been, covered. , Small, islands, are, treated, differently, depending, on, their, location. , Small, islands, close, to, and, not, differing, from, nearby, larger, land, areas, are, not, listed, separately,, whereas, remote, islands, of, similar, size, are, generally, covered. , Finally,, islands, in, shallow, water, (with, depths, of, less, than, 100, metres, to, an, adjacent, land, mass), have, only, been, islands, since, the, last, ice, ages,, with, less, opportunity, to, develop, unique, biological, features,, and, are, thus, not, treated, in, the, same, detail. , In, general,, less, effort, has, been, made, to, collect, and, enter, data, for, the, lower, priority, islands, (large,, urban,, or, in, shallow, water), and, many, gaps, in, the, information, in, this, directory, about, these, islands, will, be, obvious., The, format, has, been, designed, to, summarize, many, kinds, of, information, to, give, an, overview, of, the, geographic,, ecological, and, human, interest, of, islands. , Where, the, data, available, are, sufficient,, a, variety, of, indicators, are, used, to, make, listings, and, comparisons, of, islands, easier. , The, size, of, each, entry, has, been, adjusted, to, the, amount, of, data, entered., It, will, be, apparent, that, the, coverage, in, this, directory, is, very, uneven. , Some, regions, and, groups, are, covered, in, some, detail,, while, for, others, it, was, not, possible, to, obtain, or, enter, much, information, with, the, resources, available. , One, of, the, purposes, of, this, Internet, edition, is, to, encourage, the, compilation, of, information, to, fill, in, the, gaps, in, this, directory. , Similarly,, some, fields, have, been, included, in, the, database, for, which, data, do, not, generally, exist,, but, which, would, be, very, useful, for, comparing, islands, or, for, responding, to, particular, problems. , Again, it, is, hoped, this, will, stimulate, people, to, collect, such, information., The, deficiencies, in, the, data, available, mean, that, many, of, the, means, for, comparing, and, rating, island, characteristics, in, this, directory, cannot, be, used, to, their, full, potential, at, present. , A, zero, value, or, the, absence, of, an, entry, cannot, be, taken, as, meaning, more, than, that, the, information, was, not, available, at, the, time, of, compilation., While, the, fact, that, certain, islands, stand, out, for, their, environmental, importance, in, this, directory, is, significant,, the, converse, is, not, the, case;, island, that, do, not, stand, out, may, only, be, poorly, documented,, not, uninteresting. , This, problem, should, be, diminished, as, more, information, is, compiled., The, islands, are, grouped, by, ocean, and, country. , Some, appropriate, information, on, each, country, or, territory,, such, as, the, land, area,, sea, area, within, the, exclusive, economic, zone,, population,, population, density, and, estimated, growth, rate,, authority, responsible, for, conservation/environment,, and, legislation, for, conservation,, is, provided, under, the, country, headings, at, appropriate, places, in, the, directory. , Within, these, groupings,, islands, are, listed, in, alphabetical, order., Kinds, of, information, in, the, directory, There, is, a, page, for, each, country, or, island, territory, (where, this, may, have, separate, legal, or, administrative, arrangements), (see, model, country, page),, and, a, page, with, entries, for, each, island, within, the, country, (see, model, island, entry). , The, country, pages, include, a, count, of, the, number, of, islands, by, size,, and, a, variety, of, demographic,, economic,, social, and, environmental, statistics, at, the, country, level., There, are, text, entries, for, administrative, bodies,, legislation, and, non-governmental, organizations., Several, kinds, of, information, have, been, collected, for, each, island, when, available,, as, described, below. , A, complete, listing, of, all, the, fields, in, the, directory, is, given, in, the, Field, List., a)  , The, present, name, in, English,, the, official, name, if, in, another, language,, and, significant, former, names, if, widely, used, in, the, literature., b)  , Basic, descriptive, information, on, each, island,, such, as, its, geographic, co-ordinates,, land, area, (in, square, kilometres), and, maximum, altitude, or, elevation, (in, metres),, submerged, area, down, to, the, 100, metre, depth, contour, (in, square, kilometres),, length, of, shoreline, (in, kilometres),, and, isolation, (distance, to, nearest, equivalent, or, larger, island,, island, group, and, continent)., c)  , The, island, type, (continental,, volcanic,, atoll,, low, island,, raised, coral, limestone,, or, some, combination, of, these),, age,, geology, and, soil, types., d)  , Climate,, rainfall,, temperatures, (maximum,, minimum, and, mean;, air, and, ocean)., e)  , The, major, natural, and, human, catastrophic, threats, which, could, endanger, an, already, vulnerable, population, or, feature,, such, as, cyclones, (hurricanes, or, typhoons);, volcanic, eruptions;, earthquakes,, tsunamis, (tidal, waves),, landslides, and, other, effects, of, geological, instability;, severe, drought;, susceptibility, to, major, fires;, high, risk, of, oil, spills;, etc., f)  , The, history, of, human, occupation,, historic, and, prehistoric, populations, and, dates, of, colonization,, present, population, (with, the, year, of, the, census, or, estimate), and, density, (inhabitants, per, square, kilometre). , In, the, absence, of, a, population, figure,, an, island, should, be, assumed, to, be, inhabited, unless, otherwise, stated., g)  , Indicators, of, human, impact,, such, as, urban, areas,, airports,, types, of, economic, activity, and, agriculture,, etc.;, the, state, of, resources, (soil,, water,, etc.);, and, selected, indicators, of, economic, activity., h)  , A, brief, list, of, the, major, ecosystem, types, or, biomes, on, and, around, the, island,, where, this, information, is, available. , For, some, areas, these, data, are, very, incomplete,, and, the, failure, to, mention, an, ecosystem, does, not, mean, that, it, is, not, present,, but, only, not, recorded., i)  , Features, of, special, interest, for, conservation,, such, as, seabird, rookeries,, sea, turtle, nesting, areas,, marine, mammal, resting, or, breeding, sites,, lakes, or, other, unusual, habitats,, active, volcanoes,, and, other, information, on, the, island's, conservation, importance., j)  , The, size, and, diversity, of, the, flora, and, fauna,, such, as, the, total, numbers, of, species,, at, least, in, the, best-known, categories,, where, such, figures, were, available., k), The, numbers, of, endemic, species, (those, species, occurring, only, on, a, particular, island, or, island, group), in, the, best, studied, plant, and, animal, categories, (plants,, butterflies,, land, snails,, reptiles/amphibians,, birds,, mammals,, and, marine, life),, as, a, convenient, measure, of, evolutionary, interest, or, uniqueness;, also, the, number, of, species, classified, as, Endangered,, Vulnerable,, Rare, and, Indeterminate,, according, to, IUCN, criteria., l)  , The, scientific, and, common, names, of, endemic, species, and, other, species, of, special, conservation, interest,, with, brief, information, on, their, habitats, and, population, sizes,, and, their, status, (Endangered,, Vulnerable,, Rare,, Indeterminate,, or, K, -insufficiently, known). , The, status, is, capitalized, if, determined, by, the, World, Conservation, Monitoring, Centre, or, indicated, in, a, Red, Data, Book,, and, in, lower, case, if, obtained, from, other, sources. , An, asterisk, (*), after, the, name, shows, that, there, is, some, question, concerning, the, taxonomic, status, of, the, species., m)  , Information, on, introduced, biota,, particularly, alien, or, feral, species, or, diseases, known, to, be, invasive, on, islands, and, to, cause, major, conservation, problems., n)  , The, names, of, terrestrial, and, marine, protected, areas, on, the, island, and, their, area, in, hectares. , Recent, official, proposals, for, protected, areas, may, also, listed, for, some, countries., o)  , References, to, key, papers, with, information, on, the, island., p)  , For, islands, with, sufficient, data,, the, entry, in, the, directory, includes, a, series, of, indicators, used, to, evaluate, certain, island, characteristics. , These, include, the, ecosystem, richness, reflecting, the, number, of, types, of, ecosystems, present,, the, species, richness, based, on, the, number, of, species,, the, individual, island, and, island, group, endemics,, and, the, number, of, special, features,, all, evaluated, separately, for, terrestrial, and, marine, areas. , Other, general, island, indicators, are, the, natural, vulnerability, based, on, the, kinds, of, risks, of, natural, or, human, catastrophes,, the, natural, conservation, status, or, protection, provided, by, the, island's, inherent, situation,, the, reliability, of, the, data, on, which, the, listing, and, evaluation, are, based,, the, human, threat, measuring, the, pressure, of, the, people, on, the, land, and, resources,, the, economic, pressure, related, to, the, level, of, development, and, material, lifestyle, of, the, population,, and, three, aggregate, indicators, for, the, potential, for, human, impact, on, the, island,, and, for, the, terrestrial, conservation, importance, and, marine, conservation, importance, of, the, island. , The, details, of, the, basis, for, and, calculation, of, all, of, these, indicators, are, given, in, the, section:, Explanation, of, Island, Indicators. , The, indicators, are, intended, to, put, the, largely, qualitative, information, about, the, islands, into, a, form, permitting, some, comparisons, between, and, rankings, of, the, islands, on, a, country,, regional, or, world, basis., Notes, on, using, the, directory, -, Basic, information, on, each, country, or, territorial, entity, is, summarized, in, a, country, format, of, some, 70, fields. , Each, country, page, includes, a, list, of, links, to, each, island, in, that, country, or, territory., The, field, list, explains, the, contents, of, each, field, on, the, country, page., -, Most, of, the, detailed, information, in, the, directory, is, in, the, island, format, with, 120, fields., All, the, islands, within, a, country, are, grouped, on, the, same, page,, so, you, can, scroll, between, them. , The, country, names, on, each, island, page, are, linked, to, the, country, page., The, field, list, explains, the, contents, of, each, field, on, the, island, page., The, indicators, are, also, explained, separately., -, The, indices, and, tables, provide, direct, links, to, the, country, and, island, pages., -, A, special, feature, of, this, directory, is, the, "hot, colons". , The, colon, (, :, ), between, each, heading, and, its, contents, is, linked, to, the, description, of, that, heading, in, the, field, list,, including, explanations, of, the, numerical, values., Click, on, the, colon, and, you, have, an, immediate, explanation, of, the, content, of, the, field., Then, use, "back", to, return, to, the, page., Cautionary, note, on, data, quality, This, directory, is, a, preliminary, attempt, to, synthesize, large, amounts, of, information, on, an, island, by, island, basis, around, the, world., Many, entries, are, incomplete,, or, possibly, even, misleading, if, essential, information,, such, as, the, human, population, or, the, fact, that, the, island, is, inhabited,, have, not, yet, been, entered., In, addition,, the, following, specific, problems, with, data, quality, have, affected, the, result, and, should, be, kept, in, mind, particularly, when, using, the, directory, to, compare, islands., a)  , The, quantity, of, available, information, is, highly, variable, from, one, region, or, island, to, another. , A, few, islands, happen, to, have, been, studied, in, detail,, perhaps, by, some, scientific, expedition,, while, others, may, never, have, been, visited, by, a, scientist. , For, many, islands,, even, basic, descriptive, information, is, lacking, in, the, sources, available. , Inevitably, the, better, known, islands, stand, out, in, such, a, survey,, and, this, may, in, part, be, an, artefact, of, the, data, available., b)  , Most, islands, are, still, rather, poorly, known, scientifically,, partly, because, work, on, one, island, cannot, be, easily, generalized, to, others. , New, species, are, still, being, discovered, in, obvious, and, well-known, categories, such, as, birds, and, reptiles. , Other, categories, such, as, some, types, of, insects, have, hardly, been, looked, at, at, all., c)  , Information, on, species, is, often, only, available, at, larger, geographic, scales, such, as, island, groups,, countries, or, biogeographic, provinces. , This, can, make, it, difficult, to, know, what, specifically, occurs, on, any, given, island. , The, regional, distribution, of, many, species, is, known, or, mapped,, but, islands, are, sufficiently, variable, that, it, is, not, possible, to, assume, that, a, species, occurs, there, just, because, the, island, is, within, the, species', known, range. , Distributions, can, be, highly, irregular, or, spotty, depending, on, chance, dispersal, or, extinction, and, on, local, conditions., d)  , The, data, may, be, patchy, in, different, ways. , An, island, may, be, well, known, for, birds, or, land, snails,, but, hardly, at, all, botanically,, or, vice, versa. , This, can, have, a, particular, effect, on, levels, of, endemism,, which, may, vary, greatly, from, one, type, of, organism, to, another. , Hopefully, the, gaps, identified, in, this, directory, will, encourage, others, to, fill, them., e)  , The, cross-checking, of, data, from, different, sources, has, revealed, many, errors,, to, the, point, that, it, has, sometimes, seemed, doubtful, that, the, same, island, was, being, described. , Even, figures, such, as, the, island, surface, area, or, altitude, have, differed, by, up, to, 50%. , The, type, of, island, or, the, existence, of, specific, features, also, sometimes, vary, between, sources. , Some, errors, maybe, obviously, typographical, or, due, to, incorrect, (or, even, double), conversion, between, units, of, measure,, and, these, have, been, corrected, where, they, were, identified. , In, other, instances,, it, has, been, impossible, to, determine, which, source, of, information, is, correct,, and, one, has, had, to, be, chosen, based, on, the, probable, reliability, of, the, source. , Unfortunately, errors, such, as, these, tend, to, be, perpetuated, from, one, compilation, or, study, to, another,, and, some, have, probably, be, unwittingly, carried, over, into, this, one, where, cross-checking, with, authoritative, sources, was, not, possible., f)  , Much, of, the, available, information, is, seriously, out, of, date. , No, island, stays, still, in, time,, and, conditions, or, features, may, change, from, the, time, when, they, were, described. , Many, sources, fail, to, give, the, dates, for, their, data,, and, old, information, may, be, assumed, to, be, current. , Much, island, information, dates, from, expeditions, early, in, this, century,, or, from, World, War, II,, and, it, will, need, to, be, confirmed, or, revised, from, up-to-date, surveys, before, using, it, as, the, basis, for, important, decisions, or, conservation, actions. , Dates, have, been, added, where, known, to, the, types, of, information, in, the, directory, where, this, may, be, critical,, as, with, population, figures, or, the, status, of, a, species., In, spite, of, all, these, problems, and, sources, of, error,, it, should, be, possible, to, have, reasonable, confidence, in, the, overall, content, of, the, directory, and, the, results, of, the, review, and, analysis, based, on, it. , Enough, different, types, of, information, have, been, brought, together, to, diminish, the, impact, of, any, single, error, or, data, variable., Origin, and, Acknowledgements, This, Island, Directory, is, a, product, of, the, Island, Database, system, of, nearly, 2,000, islands, that, was, first, developed, in, 1987-89, by, Arthur, Lyon, Dahl, under, contract, to, IUCN, -, The, World, Conservation, Union, with, the, financial, support, of, the, United, Nations, Environment, Programme, (UNEP), and, the, assistance, of, the, IUCN, Task, Force, on, Conservation, of, Island, Ecosystems, and, the, World, Conservation, Monitoring, Centre., The, database, is, now, maintained, by, Arthur, Dahl, at, UNEP-GRID, Geneva. , It, has, been, redesigned, to, generate, all, the, pages, of, this, directory, directly, in, html, for, easy, updating., Major, contributions, of, data, were, made, to, the, original, database, by, the, staff, of, the, World, Conservation, Monitoring, Centre, (WCMC), under, the, supervision, of, Jerry, Harrison,, by, Timothy, H., Johnson, of, the, International, Council, for, Bird, Preservation, (now, BirdLife, International),, and, by, Christian, Depraetere, of, IRD, (formerly, ORSTOM). , Many, others, contributed, in, ways, too, numerous, to, mention., A, preliminary, edition, of, this, Island, Directory,
