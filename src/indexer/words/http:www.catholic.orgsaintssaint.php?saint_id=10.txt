Jerome,, who, was, born, Eusebius, Hieronymous, Sophronius,, was, the, most, learned, of, the, Fathers, of, the, Western, Church., He, was, born, about, the, year, 342, at, Stridonius,, a, small, town, at, the, head, of, the, Adriatic,, near, the, episcopal, city, of, Aquileia., His, father,, a, Christian,, took, care, that, his, son, was, well, instructed, at, home,, then, sent, him, to, Rome,, where, the, young, man's, teachers, were, the, famous, pagan, grammarian, Donatus, and, Victorinus,, a, Christian, rhetorician., Jerome's, native, tongue, was, the, Illyrian, dialect,, but, at, Rome, he, became, fluent, in, Latin, and, Greek,, and, read, the, literatures, of, those, languages, with, great, pleasure., His, aptitude, for, oratory, was, such, that, he, may, have, considered, law, as, a, career., He, acquired, many, worldly, ideas,, made, little, effort, to, check, his, pleasure-loving, instincts,, and, lost, much, of, the, piety, that, had, been, instilled, in, him, at, home., Yet, in, spite, of, the, pagan, and, hedonistic, influences, around, him,, Jerome, was, baptized, by, Pope, Liberius, in, 360., He, tells, us, that, "it, was, my, custom, on, Sundays, to, visit,, with, friends, of, my, own, age, and, tastes,, the, tombs, of, the, martyrs, and, Apostles,, going, down, into, those, subterranean, galleries, whose, walls, on, both, sides, preserve, the, relics, of, the, dead.", Here, he, enjoyed, deciphering, the, inscriptions., After, three, years, at, Rome,, Jerome's, intellectual, curiosity, led, him, to, explore, other, parts, of, the, world., He, visited, his, home, and, then,, accompanied, by, his, boyhood, friend, Bonosus,, went, to, Aquileia,, where, he, made, friends, among, the, monks, of, the, monastery, there,, notably, Rufinus., Then,, still, accompanied, by, Bonosus,, he, traveled, to, Treves,, in, Gaul., He, now, renounced, all, secular, pursuits, to, dedicate, himself, wholeheartedly, to, God., Eager, to, build, up, a, religious, library,, the, young, scholar, copied, out, St., Hilary's, books, on, and, his, Commentaries, on, the, Psalms,, and, got, together, other, literary, and, religious, treasures., He, returned, to, Stridonius,, and, later, settled, in, Aquileia., The, bishop, had, cleared, the, church, there, of, the, plague, of, Arianism, and, had, drawn, to, it, many, eminent, men., Among, those, with, whom, Jerome, formed, friendships, were, Chromatius, (later, canonized),, to, whom, Jerome, dedicated, several, of, his, works,, Heliodorus, (also, to, become, a, saint),, and, his, nephew, Nepotian., The, famous, theologian, Rufinus,, at, first, his, close, friend,, afterward, became, his, bitter, opponent., By, nature, an, irascible, man, with, a, sharp, tongue,, Jerome, made, enemies, as, well, as, friends., He, spent, some, years, in, scholarly, studies, in, Aquileia,, then,, in, search, of, more, perfect, solitude,, he, turned, towards, the, East., With, his, friends,, Innocent,, Heliodorus,, and, Hylas,, a, freed, slave,, he, started, overland, for, Syria., On, the, way, they, visited, Athens,, Bithynia,, Galatia,, Pontus,, Cappadocia,, and, Cilicia., The, party, arrived, at, Antioch, about, the, year, 373., There, Jerome, at, first, attended, the, lectures, of, the, famous, Apollinaris,, bishop, of, Laodicea,, who, had, not, yet, put, forward, his, heresy1, With, his, companions, he, left, the, city, for, the, desert, of, Chalcis,, about, fifty, miles, southeast, of, Antioch., Innocent, and, Hylas, soon, died, there,, and, Heliodorus, left, to, return, to, the, West,, but, Jerome, stayed, for, four, years,, which, were, passed, in, study, and, in, the, practice, of, austerity., He, had, many, attacks, of, illness, but, suffered, still, more, from, temptation., "In, the, remotest, part, of, a, wild, and, stony, desert,", he, wrote, years, afterwards, to, his, friend, Eustochium,, "burnt, up, with, the, heat, of, the, sun,, so, scorching, that, it, frightens, even, the, monks, who, live, there,, I, seemed, to, myself, to, be, in, the, midst, of, the, delights, and, crowds, of, Rome...., In, this, exile, and, prison, to, which, through, fear, of, Hell, I, had, voluntarily, condemned, myself,, with, no, other, company, but, scorpions, and, wild, beasts,, I, many, times, imagined, myself, watching, the, dancing, of, Roman, maidens, as, if, I, had, been, in, the, midst, of, them., My, face, was, pallid, with, fasting,, yet, my, will, felt, the, assaults, of, desire., In, my, cold, body, and, my, parched, flesh,, which, seemed, dead, before, its, death,, passion, was, still, able, to, live., Alone, with, the, enemy,, I, threw, myself, in, spirit, at, the, feet, of, Jesus,, watering, them, with, my, tears,, and, tamed, my, flesh, by, fasting, whole, weeks., I, am, not, ashamed, to, disclose, my, temptations,, though, I, grieve, that, I, am, not, now, what, I, then, was.", Jerome, added, to, these, trials, the, study, of, Hebrew,, a, discipline, which, he, hoped, would, help, him, in, winning, a, victory, over, himself., "When, my, soul, was, on, fire, with, wicked, thoughts,", he, wrote, in, 411,, "as, a, last, resort,, I, became, a, pupil, to, a, monk, who, had, been, a, Jew,, in, order, to, learn, the, Hebrew, alphabet., From, the, judicious, precepts, of, Quintilian,, the, rich, and, fluent, eloquence, of, Cicero,, the, graver, style, of, Fronto,, and, the, smoothness, of, Pliny,, I, turned, to, this, language, of, hissing, and, broken-winded, words., What, labor, it, cost, me,, what, difficulties, I, went, through,, how, often, I, despaired, and, abandoned, it, and, began, again, to, learn,, both, I,, who, felt, the, burden,, and, they, who, lived, with, me,, can, bear, witness., I, thank, our, Lord, that, I, now, gather, such, sweet, fruit, from, the, bitter, sowing, of, those, studies.", He, continued, to, read, the, pagan, classics, for, pleasure, until, a, vivid, dream, turned, him, from, them,, at, least, for, a, time., In, a, letter, he, describes, how,, during, an, illness,, he, dreamed, he, was, standing, before, the, tribunal, of, Christ., "Thou, a, Christian?", said, the, judge, skeptically., "Thou, art, a, Ciceronian., Where, thy, treasure, is,, there, thy, heart, is, also.", The, church, at, Antioch, was, greatly, disturbed, at, this, time, by, party, and, doctrinal, disputes., The, anchorites, in, the, desert, took, sides,, and, called, on, Jerome,, the, most, learned, of, them,, to, give, his, opinions, on, the, subjects, at, issue., He, wrote, for, guidance, to, Pope, Damasus, at, Rome., Failing, to, receive, an, answer,, he, wrote, again., "On, one, side,, the, Arian, fury, rages,, supported, by, the, secular, power;, on, the, other, side,, the, Church, (at, Antioch), is, being, divided, into, three, parts,, and, each, would, draw, me, to, itself.", No, reply, from, Damasus, is, extant;, but, we, know, that, Jerome, acknowledged, Paulinus,, leader, of, one, party,, as, bishop, of, Antioch,, and, that, when, he, left, the, desert, of, Chalcis,, he, received, from, Paulinus', hands, his, ordination, as, priest., Jerome, consented, to, ordination, only, on, condition, that, he, should, not, be, obliged, to, serve, in, any, church,, knowing, that, his, true, vocation, was, to, be, a, monk, and, recluse., About, 380, Jerome, went, to, Constantinople, to, study, the, Scriptures, under, the, Greek,, Gregory, of, Nazianzus,, then, bishop, of, that, city., Two, years, later, he, went, back, to, Rome, with, Paulinus, of, Antioch, to, attend, a, council, which, Pope, Damasus, was, holding, to, deal, with, the, Antioch, schism., Appointed, secretary, of, the, council,, Jerome, acquitted, himself, so, well, that,, when, it, was, over,, Damasus, kept, him, there, as, his, own, secretary., At, the, Pope's, request, he, prepared, a, revised, text,, based, on, the, Greek,, of, the, Latin, New, Testament,, the, current, version, of, which, had, been, disfigured, by, "wrong, copying,, clumsy, correction,, and, careless, interpolations.", He, also, revised, the, Latin, psalter., That, the, prestige, of, Rome, and, its, power, to, arbitrate, between, disputants,, East, as, well, as, West,, was, recognized, as, never, before, at, this, time,, was, due, in, some, measure, at, least, to, Jerome's, diligence, and, ability., Along, with, his, official, duties, he, was, fostering, a, new, movement, of, Christian, asceticism, among, a, group, of, noble, Roman, ladies., Several, of, them, were, to, be, canonized,, including, Albina, and, her, daughters, Marcella, and, Asella,, Melania, the, Elder,, who, was, the, first, of, them, to, go, to, the, Holy, Land,, and, Paula,, with, her, daughters,, Blesilla, and, Eustochium., The, tie, between, Jerome, and, the, three, last-mentioned, women, was, especially, close,, and, to, them, he, addressed, many, of, his, famous, letters., When, Pope, Damasus, died, in, 384,, he, was, succeeded, by, Siricius,, who, was, less, friendly, to, Jerome., While, serving, Damasus,, Jerome, had, impressed, all, by, his, personal, holiness,, learning,, and, integrity., But, he, had, also, managed, to, get, himself, widely, disliked, by, pagans, and, evil-doers, whom, he, had, condemned,, and, also, by, people, of, taste, and, tolerance,, many, of, them, Christians,, who, were, offended, by, his, biting, sarcasm, and, a, certain, ruthlessness, in, attack., An, example, of, his, style, is, the, harsh, diatribe, against, the, artifices, of, worldly, women,, who, "paint, their, cheeks, with, rouge, and, their, eyelids, with, antimony,, whose, plastered, faces,, too, white, for, human, beings,, look, like, idols;, and, if, in, a, moment, of, forgetfulness, they, shed, a, tear, it, makes, a, furrow, where, it, rolls, down, the, painted, cheek;, women, to, whom, years, do, not, bring, the, gravity, of, age,, who, load, their, heads, with, other, people's, hair,, enamel, a, lost, youth, upon, the, wrinkles, of, age,, and, affect, a, maidenly, timidity, in, the, midst, of, a, troop, of, grand, children.", In, a, letter, to, Eustochium, he, writes, with, scorn, of, certain, members, of, the, Roman, clergy., "All, their, anxiety, is, about, their, clothes...., You, would, take, them, for, bridegrooms, rather, than, for, clerics;, all, they, think, about, is, knowing, the, names, and, houses, and, doings, of, rich, ladies.", Although, Jerome's, indignation, was, usually, justified,, his, manner, of, expressing, it-both, verbally, and, in, letters-aroused, resentment., His, own, reputation, was, attacked;, his, bluntness,, his, walk,, and, even, his, smile, were, criticized., And, neither, the, virtue, of, the, ladies, under, his, direction, nor, his, own, scrupulous, behavior, towards, them, was, any, protection, from, scandalous, gossip., Affronted, at, the, calumnies, that, were, circulated,, Jerome, decided, to, return, to, the, East., Taking, with, him, his, brother, Paulinian, and, some, others,, he, embarked, in, August,, 385., At, Cyprus,, on, the, way,, he, was, received, with, joy, by, Bishop, Epiphanius,, and, at, Antioch, also, he, conferred, with, leading, churchmen., It, was, here,, probably,, that, he, was, joined, by, the, widow, Paula, and, some, other, ladies, who, had, left, Rome, with, the, aim, of, settling, in, the, Holy, Land., With, what, remained, of, Jerome's, own, patrimony, and, with, financial, help, from, Paula,, a, monastery, for, men, was, built, near, the, basilica, of, the, Nativity, at, Bethlehem,, and, also, houses, for, three, communities, of, women., Paula, became, head, of, one, of, these,, and, after, her, death, was, succeeded, by, her, daughter, Eustochium., Jerome, himself, lived, and, worked, in, a, large, cave, near, the, Saviour's, birthplace., He, opened, a, free, school, there, and, also, a, hospice, for, pilgrims,, "so, that,", as, Paula, said,, "should, Mary, and, Joseph, visit, Bethlehem, again,, they, would, have, a, place, to, stay.", Now, at, last, Jerome, began, to, enjoy, some, years, of, peaceful, activity., He, gives, us, a, wonderful, description, of, this, fruitful,, harmonious,, Palestinian, life,, and, its, attraction, for, all, manner, of, men., "Illustrious, Gauls, congregate, here,, and, no, sooner, has, the, Briton,, so, remote, from, our, world,, arrived, at, religion, than, he, leaves, his, early-setting, sun, to, seek, a, land, which, he, knows, only, by, reputation, and, from, the, Scriptures., Then, the, Armenians,, the, Persians,, the, peoples, of, India, and, Ethiopia,, of, Egypt,, and, of, Pontus,, Cappadocia,, Syria,, and, Mesopotamia!..., They, come, in, throngs, and, set, us, examples, of, every, virtue., The, languages, differ, but, the, religion, is, the, same;, as, many, different, choirs, chant, the, psalms, as, there, are, nations...., Here, bread, and, herbs,, planted, with, our, own, hands,, and, milk,, all, country, fare,, furnish, us, plain, and, healthy, food., In, summer, the, trees, give, us, shade., In, autumn, the, air, is, cool, and, the, falling, leaves, restful., In, spring, our, psalmody, is, sweeter, for, the, singing, of, the, birds., We, have, plenty, of, wood, when, winter, snow, and, cold, are, upon, us., Let, Rome, keep, its, crowds,, let, its, arenas, run, with, blood,, its, circuses, go, mad,, its, theaters, wallow, in, sensuality....", But, when, the, Christian, faith, was, threatened, Jerome, could, not, be, silent., While, at, Rome, in, the, time, of, Pope, Damasus,, he, had, composed, a, book, on, the, perpetual, virginity, of, the, Virgin, Mary, against, one, Helvidius,, who, had, maintained, that, Mary, had, not, remained, always, a, virgin, but, had, had, other, children, by, St., Joseph,, after, the, birth, of, Christ., This, and, similar, ideas, were, now, again, put, forward, by, a, certain, Jovinian,, who, had, been, a, monk., Paula's, son-in-law,, Pammachius,, sent, some, of, this, heretical, writing, to, Jerome,, and, he,, in, 393,, wrote, two, books, against, Jovinian., In, the, first, he, described, the, excellence, of, virginity., The, books, were, written, in, Jerome's, vehement, style, and, there, were, expressions, in, them, which, seemed, lacking, in, respect, for, honorable, matrimony., Pammachius, informed, Jerome, of, the, offense, which, he, and, many, others, at, Rome, had, taken, at, them., Thereupon, Jerome, composed, his, ,, sometimes, called, his, third, book, against, Jovinian,, in, which, he, showed, by, quoting, from, his, own, earlier, works, that, he, regarded, marriage, as, a, good, and, honorable, state, and, did, not, condemn, even, a, second, or, a, third, marriage., A, few, years, later, he, turned, his, attention, to, one, Vigilantius,, a, Gallic, priest,, who, was, denouncing, both, celibacy, and, the, veneration, of, saints', relics,, calling, those, who, revered, them, idolaters, and, worshipers, of, ashes., In, defending, celibacy, Jerome, said, that, a, monk, should, purchase, security, by, flying, from, temptations, and, dangers, when, he, distrusted, his, own, strength., As, to, the, veneration, of, relics,, he, declared:, "We, do, not, worship, the, relics, of, the, martyrs,, but, honor, them, in, our, worship, of, Him, whose, martyrs, they, are., We, honor, the, servants, in, order, that, the, respect, paid, to, them, may, be, reflected, back, to, the, Lord.", Honoring, them,, he, said,, was, not, idolatry, because, no, Christian, had, ever, adored, the, martyrs, as, gods;, on, the, other, hand,, they, pray, for, us., "If, the, Apostles, and, martyrs,, while, still, living, on, earth,, could, pray, for, other, men,, how, much, more, may, they, do, it, after, their, victories?, Have, they, less, power, now, that, they, are, with, Jesus, Christ?", He, told, Paula,, after, the, death, of, her, daughter, Blesilla,, "She, now, prays, to, the, Lord, for, you,, and, obtains, for, me, the, pardon, of, my, sins.", Jerome, was, never, moderate, whether, in, virtue, or, against, evil., Though, swift, to, anger,, he, was, also, swift, to, feel, remorse, and, was, even, more, severe, on, his, own, failings, than, on, those, of, others., From, 395, to, 400, Jerome, was, engaged, in, a, war, against, Origenism2,, which, unhappily, created, a, breach, in, his, long, friendship, with, Rufinus., Finding, that, some, Eastern, monks, had, been, led, into, error, by, the, authority, of, Rufinus', name, and, learning,, Jerome, attacked, him., Rufinus,, then, living, in, a, monastery, at, Jerusalem,, had, translated, many, of, Origen's, works, into, Latin, and, was, an, enthusiastic, upholder, of, his, scholarship,, though, it, does, not, appear, that, he, meant, to, defend, the, heresies, in, Origen's, writings., Augustine,, bishop, of, Hippo,, was, one, of, the, churchmen, greatly, distressed, by, the, quarrel, between, Jerome, and, Rufinus,, and, became, unwillingly, involved, in, a, controversy, with, Jerome., Jerome's, passionate, controversies, were, the, least, important, part, of, his, activities., What, has, made, his, name, so, famous, was, his, critical, labor, on, the, text, of, the, Scriptures., The, Church, regards, him, as, the, greatest, of, all, the, doctors, in, clarifying, the, Divine, Word., He, had, the, best, available, aids, for, such, an, undertaking,, living, where, the, remains, of, Biblical, places,, names,, and, customs, all, combined, to, give, him, a, more, vivid, view, than, he, could, have, had, at, a, greater, distance., To, continue, his, study, of, Hebrew, he, hired, a, famous, Jewish, scholar,, Bar, Ananias,, who, came, to, teach, him, by, night,, lest, other, Jews, should, learn, of, it., As, a, man, of, prayer, and, purity, of, heart, whose, life, had, been, mainly, spent, in, study,, penance,, and, contemplation,, Jerome, was, prepared, to, be, a, sensitive, interpreter, of, spiritual, things., We, have, seen, that, already, while, at, Rome, he, had, made, a, revision, of, the, current, Latin, New, Testament,, and, of, the, Psalms., Now, he, undertook, to, translate, most, of, the, books, of, the, Old, Testament, directly, from, the, Hebrew., The, friends, and, scholars, who, urged, him, to, this, task, realized, the, superiority, of, a, version, made, directly, from, the, original, to, any, second-hand, version,, however, venerable., It, was, needed, too, for, argument, with, the, Jews,, who, recognized, no, other, text, as, authentic, but, their, own., He, began, with, the, Books, of, Kings,, and, went, on, with, the, rest, at, different, times., When, he, found, that, the, Book, of, Tobias, and, part, of, Daniel, had, been, composed, in, Chaldaic,, he, set, himself, to, learn, that, difficult, language, also., More, than, once, he, was, tempted, to, give, up, the, whole, wearisome, task,, but, a, certain, scholarly, tenacity, of, purpose, kept, him, at, it., The, only, parts, of, the, Latin, Bible,, now, known, as, the, Vulgate,, which, were, not, either, translated, or, worked, over, by, him, are, the, Books, of, Wisdom,, Ecclesiasticus,, Baruch,, and, the, two, Books, of, the, Maccabees.3, He, revised, the, Psalms, once, again,, with, the, aid, of, Origen's, ,4, and, the, Hebrew, text., This, last, is, the, version, included, now, in, the, Vulgate, and, used, generally, in, the, Divine, Office;, his, first, revision,, known, as, the, Roman, Psalter,, is, still, used, for, the, opening, psalm, at, Matins, and, throughout, the, Missal,, and, for, the, Divine, Office, in, the, cathedrals, of, St., Peter, at, Rome, and, St., Mark, at, Venice,, and, in, the, Milanese, rite., In, the, sixteenth, century, the, great, Council, of, Trent, pronounced, Jerome's, Vulgate, the, authentic, and, authoritative, Latin, text, of, the, Catholic, Church,, without,, however,, thereby, implying, a, preference, for, it, above, the, original, text, or, above, versions, in, other, languages., In, 1907, Pope, Pius, X, entrusted, to, the, Benedictine, Order, the, office, of, restoring, as, far, as, possible, the, correct, text, of, St., Jerome's, Vulgate,, which, during, fifteen, centuries, of, use, had, naturally, become, altered, in, many, places., The, Bible, now, ordinarily, used, by, English-speaking, Catholics, is, a, translation, of, the, Vulgate,, made, at, Rheims, and, Douay, towards, the, end, of, the, sixteenth, century,, and, revised, by, Bishop, Challoner, in, the, eighteenth., The, Confraternity, Edition, of, the, New, Testament, appearing, in, 1950, represents, a, complete, revision., A, heavy, blow, came, to, Jerome, in, 404, when, his, staunch, friend,, the, saintly, Paula,, died., Six, years, later, he, was, stunned, by, news, of, the, sacking, of, Rome, by, Alaric, the, Goth., Of, the, refugees, who, fled, from, Rome, to, the, East, at, this, time, he, wrote:, "Who, would, have, believed, that, the, daughters, of, that, mighty, city, would, one, day, be, wandering, as, servants, and, slaves, on, the, shores, of, Egypt, and, Africa,, or, that, Bethlehem, would, daily, receive, noble, Romans,, distinguished, ladies,, brought, up, in, wealth, and, now, reduced, to, beggary?, I, cannot, help, them, all,, but, I, grieve, and, weep, with, them,, and, am, completely, absorbed, in, the, duties, which, charity, imposes, on, me., I, have, put, aside, my, commentary, on, Ezekiel, and, almost, all, study., For, today, we, must, translate, the, precepts, of, the, Scriptures, into, deeds;, instead, of, speaking, saintly, words,, we, must, act, them.", A, few, years, later, his, work, was, again, interrupted, by, raids, of, barbarians, pushing, north, through, Egypt, into, Palestine,, and, later, still, by, a, violent, onset, of, Pelagian, heretics,, who,, relying, on, the, protection, of, Bishop, John, of, Jerusalem,, sent, a, troop, of, ruffians, to, Bethlehem, to, disperse, the, monks, and, nuns, living, there, under, the, direction, of, Jerome,, who, had, been, opposing, Pelagianism5, with, his, customary, truculence., Some, of, the, monks, were, beaten,, a, deacon, was, killed,, and, monasteries, were, set, on, fire., Jerome, had, to, go, into, hiding, for, a, time., The, following, year, Paula's, daughter, Eustochium, died., The, aged, Jerome, soon, fell, ill,, and, after, lingering, for, two, years, succumbed., Worn, with, penance, and, excessive, labor,, his, sight, and, voice, almost, gone,, his, body, like, a, shadow,, he, died, peacefully, on, September, 30,, 420,, and, was, buried, under, the, church, of, the, Nativity, at, Bethlehem., In, the, thirteenth, century, his, body, was, translated, and, now, lies, somewhere, in, the, Sistine, Chapel, of, the, basilica, of, Santa, Maria, Maggiore, at, Rome., The, Church, owes, much, to, St., Jerome., While, his, great, work, was, the, Vulgate,, his, achievements, in, other, fields, are, valuable;, to, him, we, owe, the, distinction, between, canonical, and, apocryphal, writings;, he, was, a, pioneer, in, the, field, of, Biblical, archeology,, his, commentaries, are, important;, his, letters,, published, in, three, volumes,, are, one, of, our, best, sources, of, knowledge, of, the, times., St., Jerome, has, been, a, popular, subject, with, artists,, who, have, pictured, him, in, the, desert,, as, a, scholar, in, his, study,, and, sometimes, in, the, robes, of, a, cardinal,, because, of, his, services, for, Pope, Damasus;, often, too, he, is, shown, with, a, lion,, from, whose, paw,, according, to, legend,, he, once, drew, a, thorn., Actually, this, story, was, transferred, to, him, from, the, tradition, of, St., Gerasimus,, but, a, lion, is, not, an, inappropriate, symbol, for, so, fearless, a, champion, of, the, faith., ←, St., Jeremy, Bl., Jerome, de, Angelis, →, St., Jerome, Products, by, CatholicShopping.com, Saints, Fun, Facts, -, St., Jerome, FREE, Digital,
