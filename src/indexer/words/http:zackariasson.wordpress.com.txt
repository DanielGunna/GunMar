in, Uncategorized, |, Leave, a, comment, The, second, presentation, on, the, SCOS, conference, (see, last, post), was, together, with, Bibiana, Pulido, on, work, migration, within, the, games, industry., I’m, already, looking, forward, to, SCOS, 2016, in, Uppsala, on, the, theme, Animal!, It, is, said, that, cultural, industries, require, a, qualified, and, mobile, labour, force., Careers, in, these, industries, are, often, characterised, by, “boundarylessness”, (Arthur, and, Rousseau,, 1996)., These, persons, are, described, as, having, “boundaryless, and, protean, careers”, where, they, self-manage, their, own, careers, and, move, from, one, work, place, to, another, (Arthur, and, Rousseau,, 1996;, Briscoe, and, Hall,, 2006)., They, do, not, have, the, perspective, of, doing, a, lifetime, career, in, one, work, organization,, but, see, the, evolution, of, their, career,, through, mobility, between, different, firms,, which, enables, them, to, work, in, different, projects;, the, Silicon, Valley, model, of, personal, mobility, is, said, to, be, the, essence, in, the, “new, economy”, (Benner,, 2002)., Although, clusters,, like, the, Silicon, Valley,, have, adopted, this, discourse, it, is, equally, important, to, highlight, what, these, changing, attitudes, toward, work, have, had, on, personal, development,, organising, and, life, quality, (Boltanski, and, Chiapello,, 2007)., Read, the, rest, of, this, entry, », Das, Heimlich, von, Kriege, –, War, is, Hell,, Hell, is, Home:, Ideology,, War, and, the, Mobilisation, of, the Home, 26, July, 2015, in, Uncategorized, |, Leave, a, comment, This, July, I, spent, a, few, wonderful, days, at, the, SCOS, conference, in, Nottingham,, UK., This, is, one, of, the, truly, inspiring, academic, conferences, with, a, welcoming, athmosphere, and, great, presentations., The, theme, for, this, year, was, HOME,, and, it, was, impressing, to, see, what, people, had, done, with, this., Me,, I, as, part, of, two, presetations., The, first, with, Stphen, Webley, on, home, and, war., “This, is, my, Home!”, WarDaddy, (Brad, Pitt), referring, to, ‘Fury’, his, Sherman, Firefly, tank, in, the, film, of, the, same, name., 2014., War, is, hell,, we, tell, ourselves, yet, war, and, ideology, mobilises, the, concept, of, the, home, to, motivate, the, human, mind, to, accept, the, hell, of, warfare., Popular, culture, refers, to, this, aspect, of, combat, motivation, in, books,, films, and, games,, yet, this, ideological, act, of, fantasy, has, very, real, connotations., During, the, 20th, Century, the, ideologies, of, modern, war, negated, the, concept, of, home, itself., The, Fatherland, of, Nazi, Germany, dictated, that, every, home, becomes, a, pillbox, and, every, cellar, a, fighting, retreat., In, Soviet, Russia, every, city, became, a, fortress, under, siege,, furniture, became, firewood, and, objects, of, comfort, took, new, forms,, just, as, every, pet, became, a, potential, meal., Every, trench, became, a, home, that, fostered, its, own, new, brand, of, communal, existence, and, the, politics, of, trench, socialism., In, modern, war, even, technology, itself, became, home, –, submariners, and, sailors,, tankers, and, pilots, all, referred, to, their, war, machines, in, the, context, of, home., Read, the, rest, of, this, entry, », The, 23rd, Nordic, Academy, of,

Having, studies, diffreent, cultural, industries, I, will, cover, give, my, view, on, trying, to, squeeze, culture, production, production, into, a, box, of, structural, models., Here’s, what, the, web, page, says:, “Det, projektbaserade, samhället, har, brett, ut, sina, vingar, över, alla, dagens, organisationer., Frågan, om, man, jobbar, inom, projekt, har, idag, istället, omformulerats, till,

jobbar, efter, andra, värdegrunder,, men, många, gånger, tvingas, in, i, det, projektifierade, samhällets, diskurs., Från, målbilder, till, kreativitet, så, finns, det, mycket, att, lära, från,

chapter, for, our, book, on, the, arts, and, business!, This, will, be, published, by, Routledge, in, 2016., The, book, aims, at, bringing, the, arts, and, business, scholars, together, in, a, dialogue, about, a, number, of, key, topics, that, today, form, different, understandings, in, the, two, disciplines., The, arts, and, business, are, often, positioned, as, opposites., Where, the, one, is, providing, symbolic, and, aesthetic, immersion,, the, other, is, creating, markets, and, goods., Yet, they, frequently, deal, with, the, same, issues,, framing, it, differently, and, constructing, various, solutions., The, idea, is, that, two, authors,, one, from, arts, studies, and, the, other, from, business, studies,, present,, discuss, and, reflect, on, how, each, of, these, topics, has, been, treated, in, their, respective, disciplines., We, perceive, each, chapter, as, a, dialogue, (or, the, result, of, a, dialogue), between, two, authors, on, this, one, specific, issue, of, current, social, life., In, bringing, your, two, views, together, the, chapter, has, a, possibility, to, develop, these, into, a, coherent, understanding, of, society,, or, expose, them, to, critical, differences,, in, bridging, knowledge, between, the, arts, and, business., Read, the, rest, of, this, entry, », Business, models, in, cultural industries, 09, October, 2014, in,

the, lovely, International, Colloquium, on, Arts,, Heritage,, Non-Profit, and, Social, Marketing., This, year, I, am, presenting, a, study, of, the, Swedish, Heavy, Metal, group, Mustasch, and, the, production, of, performing, music., The, aim, of, this, article, is, to, explore, music, performances, as, part, of, market, making, practices, (e.g., Callon,, 1998;, Callon, et, al.,, 2007;, Cochoy,, 2008,, 2010)., These, approaches, applid, in, science, studies, has, had, a, major, impact, on, social, sciences, in, redefining, the, meaning, of, social, construction, and, practices., The, impact, on, market, studies, has, been, to, retrace, the, subject,, from, a, study, of, abstract, marketing, principles,, to, market, actions, –, toward, what, actors, and, what, actions, define, a, market., ANT’s, concept, of, a, network, is, that, this, is, not, something, persistent, that, exist, ‘out, there’,, but, rather, a, conceptual, metaphor, for, understanding, actors, and, relationship, between, these, (Latour,, 2005)., A, network, is, thus, always, in, the, becoming,, is, always, being, constructed., This, is, an, effect, of, that, ANT, “treats, everything, in, the, social, and, natural, world, as, a, continuously, generated, effect, of, the, web, of, relations, within, which, they, are, located.”, (Law,, 2009,, 141)., Read, the, rest, of, this, entry, », Playing,

Claudia, Schnugg, and, myself., The, paper, is, about, musicians, and, how, they, play, being, musicians., The, game, of, playing, a, part,, just, as, they, play, music., The, paper, should, be, seen, as, a, play, with, theses, concepts,, seeing, what, will, come, out, of, it., “Your, job, is, to, live, the, fantasiser, other, only, dream, about., Don’t, go, in, half-heart., Dream, big., Live, the, life.”, (Drummer, A.C., in, Rock, Star,, Warner, Bros., 2001), It, has, been, argued, that, we, humans, are, the, homo, ludens,, that, we, a, playing, being, that, is, both, formed, by, these, actions;, just, as, we, have, formed, society, through, playing., Huizinga, (1950/1955), classical, exploration, of, play, and, society, present, a, trajectory, where, many, (if, not, most), aspect, of, society, are, result, of, playful, interactions, at, one, point., Although, play, had, an, important, role, in, forming, society, Huizinga, argue, that, play, now, have, been, relegated, to, separated, spheres,, magical, circles, with, no, relation, to, ‘real, life’., These, thoughts, were, further, developed, by, Callois, (1958/2001), in, categorizing, play, and, game, that, further, strengthened, both, the, importance, and, marginalization, of, play, in, social, life., Read, the, rest, of, this, entry, », Peter, Zackariasson,, Ph.D., I, am, an, associate, professor, at,
