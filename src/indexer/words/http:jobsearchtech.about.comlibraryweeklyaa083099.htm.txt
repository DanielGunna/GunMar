Careers, Changing, Careers, Basics, Job, Search, Career, Types, Education, Skills, Workplace, Issues, By, John, Steven, Niznik, Updated, May, 25,, 2016, If, you're, the, adventurous,, entrepreneurial, type,, then, working, as, an, independent, contractor, might, be, a, great career, choice, for, you., Independent, contractors, are, sometimes, called, ICs,, consultants,, freelancers,, free, agents, or, just, contractors., Regardless, of, the, label,, all, are, self-employed, for, tax, purposes, in, the, U.S., and, are, essentially, the, same, in, practice., Regarding, taxes,, the, Internal, Revenue, Service, has, only, two, distinctions:, independent, contractor, or, employee., More, about, that, follows., Pros, of, Working, as, an, Independent, Contractor, As, an, independent, contractor,, you, are, your, own, boss., That's, the, main, reason, why, people, decide, to, set, up, their, own, shop., If, you're, a, contractor,, you, might, work, shoulder-to-shoulder, with, employees, of, the, company, you, work, with., But, these, folks, are, not, your, supervisors,, they, are, your, clients., As, such,, they, may, not, direct, your, work, as, they, might, direct, that, of, an, employee., Your, clients, can,, however,, require, certain, results, in, return, for, the, fees, they, pay, you., But, you, get, to, decide, when,, where, and, how, the, work, is, done., According, to, the, Common, Law, Rules, enforced, by, the, IRS, and, the, Fair, Labor, Standards, Act, issued, by, the, Department, of, Labor,, the, difference, between, an, employee, and, a contractor, largely, hinges, on, the, degree, of, control, and, independence, granted, by, the, client., Independent, contractors, typically, provide, their, own, tools., If, your, clients, provide, the, tools,, then, one, of, the, enforcing, agencies, might, penalize, them, for, misclassifying, you, as, an, independent, contractor, when, you, should, have, been, classified, as, an, employee., As, an, independent, contractor,, you'll, usually, make, more, money, than, if, you, were, an, employee., Companies, are, willing, to, pay, more, for, independent, contractors, because, they, don't, have, the, enter, into, expensive,, long-term, commitments, or, pay, any, extras,, such, as, health, benefits,, unemployment, compensation,, and, Social, Security, and, Medicare, taxes., Independent, contractors, also, may, deduct, more, business, expenses, than, employees, typically, can, claim., Unlike, employees,, independent, contractors, are, required, to, withhold, their, own, federal,, state, and, local, taxes., Cons, of, Working, as, an, Independent, Contractor, In, most, cases,, contractors, aren’t, eligible, for, state, unemployment, benefits,, because, they're, self-employed,, and, they, must, fund, their, own, retirement, accounts., Health, and, liability, insurance, rates, for, self-employed, individuals, are, usually, higher, than, the, group, rates, employers, can, secure, for, their, employees., Some, clients, may, require, you, to, carry, liability, insurance., Companies, generally, can’t, reimburse, independent, contractors, for, out-of-pocket, expenses,, so, you, should, factor, in, those, expenses, when, determining, your, rates., Because, of, the, issues, that, can, arise, around, whether, a, worker, is, an, employee, or, a, contractor,, some, skittish, employers, won't, hire, contractors, who, use, their, social, security, numbers, as, taxpayer, IDs., If, an, employer, reports, the, earnings, of, a, contractor, under, that, individual's, social, security, number,, it, can, trigger, a, red, flag, to, the, IRS,, which, might, undertake, an, audit, under, the, suspicion, that, the, employer, is, misclassifying, employees, as, independent, contractors, to, avoid, withholding, taxes, and, providing, benefits., To, bypass, the, problem,, obtain, a, federal, employer, identification, number, (EIN), and, submit, that, in, place, of, your, social, security, number., A, state, taxpayer, ID, (if, required), can, save, you, money, by, allowing, you, to, buy, items, at, wholesale, and, free, of, sales, tax,, provided, you, intend, to, resell, the, merchandise., Your, local, Small, Business, Administration, Office, can, help, you, get, started, with, this, and, other, business, matters, too,, for, free., Tips, for, Being, a, Successful, Independent, Contractor, To, help, you, network,, gain, expertise, and, receive, discounts, on, insurance, and, other, self-employment, expenses,, consider, joining, professional, organizations, such, as, the, National, Association, for, the, Self-Employed., You'll, also, find, a, bevy, of, resources, at, the, U.S., Small, Business, Administration's, website., When, you’re, starting, out,, apply, to, agencies, that, can, connect, you, with, contract, work., Remember,, though,, that, these, agencies, may, withhold, taxes, and, collect, other, deductions, from, your, paychecks,, depending, on, your, working, relationship, with, the, firm., Agencies, may, also, charge, you, a commission,, which, will, reduce, your, compensation, (although, you, can, deduct, it, on, your, tax, returns)., Setting, up, your, own, business, as, an, independent, contractor, requires, an, investment, of, time, and, energy,, but, the, risk, can, pay, off, handsomely., For, those, with, a, creative, and, entrepreneurial, spirit,, the, rewards, will, be, more, than, just, monetary., Show, Full, Article, Article, Options, for, Paying, an, Independent, Contractor, Read, Article,
