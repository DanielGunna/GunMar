[traditional|, modernist|, criticism|, theory|, workshop|, exhibits|, resources|, blog, RHETORICAL, BASE, TO, POETRY, Rhetoric, was, formerly, an, indispensable, aid, to, writing, poetry,, and, some, of, its, approaches, are, still, helpful., Taxis,, or, the, structure, of, argument,, shows, how, lines, and, phrases, work, on, our, affective, understanding., Lexis, or, diction, governs, the, emotive, correlates,, and, so, the, appeals, to, the, fundamental, human, condition., Detailed, rhetorical, analysis, will, show, how, each, operates, to, achieve, its, ends., Introduction, Rhetoric, is, now, neglected., Originally, it, meant, the, effective, use, of, language,, not, only, to, sway, the, ignorant, mob, but, to, persuade, one's, intellectual, peers., And, by, governing, such, matters, as, laying, out, an, argument,, presenting, the, evidence,, employing, the, appropriate, syntax, and, diction,, rhetoric, was, unavoidable, —, in, law,, politics,, literature, and, everyday, life., {1}, But, today, rhetoric, conjures, up, the, specious, promises, of, politicians,, the, showy, ornament, of, discarded, literary, styles,, and, the, empty, pretences, of, admen, and, spin-doctors., Rhetoric, even, disallows, thought,, predetermining, what, our, public, ideologues, must, say., Perhaps, for, this, reason, contemporary, poetry, has, become, rather, prosaic,, even, pedestrian,, taking, for, granted, that, plainness, bespeaks, sincerity., But, it, was, not, always, so., {2}, Even, the, prodigiously-gifted, Shakespeare,, the, most, supremely, original, and, creative, of, writers,, in, practice, followed, the, rules, of, Renaissance, rhetoric, very, closely,, depending, on, it, for, his, most, striking, effects., {3}, His, classical, education, was, not, wasted,, any, more, than, the, stories, he, borrowed, and, adapted., Rhetoric, is, not, extinct, in, popular, literature., Anyone, attending, courses, on, article, or, feature, writing, will, be, taken, through, the, standard, devices,, which, themselves, derive, from, rhetoric., The, public, expects, articles, to, conform, to, certain, specifications,, and, something, departing, too, much, from, the, usual, is, simply, not, read., Equally,, there, are, conventions, for, the, short, story,, for, novels,, and, for, poetry., Rhetoric, has, always, entered, into, very, fabric, of, literature, —, not, only, to, persuade,, but, to, inform,, move,, entertain,, distract, and, amuse., The, structure, of, taxis, —, the, overall, shape, of, a, successful, appeal, to, an, audience, —, was, usually, simple., Attract, the, attention, by, producing, something, of, immediate, personal, interest., Make, an, argument, with, a, few, more, instances,, but, not, too, many,, and, keep, them, relevant., Lead, to, agreement, with, personal, assurances,, guarantees,, claims, on, authority., Conclude, by, complimenting, the, audience, on, their, humanity, and, common, sense., Equally, obvious, and, necessary, is, finding, the, appropriate, words,, tone, and, gestures:, lexis., This, meant, not, only, avoiding, the, pompous,, the, uncouth, and, insincere,, but, making, some, correlation, to, larger, themes,, to, precisely, the, tabloid, issues, mentioned, above., No, link, with, the, fundamental, issues, of, human, existence,, and, the, appeal, only, ruffles, the, surface,, as, is, the, case, with, TV, adverts,, however, well, made., Poem, The, Architects, But,, as, you'd, expect,, they, are, very, Impatient,, the, buildings,, having, much, in, them, Of, the,

course,, More, burdensome,, underwritten, as, It, were, with, past, days, overcast, And, glinting,, obdurate,, part, of, the, Silicate, of, tough, lives,, distant, and, intricate, As, the, whirring, bureaucrats, let, in, And, settled, with, coffee, in, the, concrete, pallets,, Awaiting, the, post, and, the, department, meeting, —, Except, that, these, do, not, know, it,, at, least, do, not, Seem,

light-headed, with, the, blue, airiness, Spinning, around,, and, muzzy,, a, neuralgia, Calling, at, random, like, frail, relations,, a, phone, Ringing, in, a, distant, office, they, cannot, get, to,,

not, at, all, expect, buildings, to, be, impatient,, and, cannot, initially, understand, what, is, meant., Something, to, do, with, their, constituents, we, realize, in, a, line, or, two,, but, are, then, taken, off, on, a, roller-coaster, of, associations., Is, there, an, argument,, and, how, would, it, appear, if, set, out, by, the, laws, of, classical, rhetoric?, exordium, (introduction:,

(I'm, only, suggesting, it), they, become, attentive,, or, we, do, (or, even, if, they, aren't, aware, of, it,, we, are), what, we, talk, about,, we,, constructing, (because, of, course, it's, part, of, our, job), will, dress, them, as, friends, (they, only, appear, so),  , peroratio, (graceful, withdrawal), Fill..., Us, in, deep, hinterlands, of, incurved, glass, (and, with, this, unpleasant, claustrophobic, feeling, I, will, leave, you.),  , So, what, do, we, conclude?, That, there, is, an, argument,, which, is, logically, laid, out,, but, not, very, clear?, Yes,, but, there, is, a, more, crucial, point., To, powerfully, move, an, audience, the, speaker, must, bear, in, mind, certain, maxims:, 1., Subject, matter, must, be, broadly, empathetic., 2., Stance, should, be, direct, and, uncomplicated., 3., Argument, should, be, compulsively, developed., 4., Emphasis, should, focus, on, one, or, two, images, or, correlates.,  ,  , Rhetorical, Types,  , Are, these, maxims, obeyed, here?, Terminology, is, difficult,, a, forest, of, forbidding, names,, but, as, a, simple, introduction, we, group, as, follows:, All, aspects, of, rhetoric,, everything, that, gives, point, and, controlling, shape, to, thoughts, and, observations,, we, call, figure,, subdividing, figure, into, scheme, where, word, order, and, syntax, is, involved,, and, trope, for, plays, on, the, sense, or, meaning, of, words., Tropes, we, further, subdivide, into, those, which, involve, word, meaning, (e.g., metaphor),, and, those, which, more, involve, the, sense, of, the, passage, (e.g., irony)., Amongst, schemes, —, for, the, record,, without, illustration, or, explanation, for, the, moment, —, are, anaphora,, epistrophe,, anadiplosis,, climax,, symploce,, parison,, isocolon,, chiasmus,, hendiadys,, oxymoron,, zeugma,, epizeuxis,, epanorthesis,, epanalepsis,, antanaclasis,, polyptoton., Among, the, word, meaning, tropes, are, simile,, metaphor,, metonymy,, sinecdoche,, paronomasia, and, personification., Among, the, passage, tropes, are, irony,, paradox,, hyperbole,, litotes,, aporia,, anacoenosis,, comprobatio, and, epitropis., {4}, Taking, the, schemes, in, turn:, anaphora, (first, word, or, phrase, repeated), we, do, what, we, talk, about, We,, constructing..., parison, (parallel, constructions,, often, in, twos, or, threes), they, are, very, impatient,, the, buildings,, having, much, in, them, of, the, North, Sea, flurrying, the, grit, lifting, the, pebbles, flinging, them, with, a, hoarse, roar..., the, cliffs, higher,, of, course,, More, burdensome,, underwritten, as, it, were, with, past, days, overcast, And, glinting,, obdurate,, part, of, the, silicate, of, tough, lives,, And, they, lightheaded,, with, the, blue, airiness, spinning, around,, and, muzzy,, a, neuralgia, calling, at, random, like, frail, relations, we, do, (become, attentive), what, we, talk, about, constructing, these, webs, of, buildings,  , hendiadys, (two, nouns, or, adjectives, of, similar, or, contingent, meaning), More, burdensome, overcast, obdurate, Silicate, of, past, lives, cloudless, almost, vacuumed, lightheaded, with, a, blue, airiness, spinning, about,

they, lightheaded, placid, but, unbearable,  , epanorthesis, (recall, of, a, word, to, suggest, more, appropriate, expression), calling, at, random..., a, phone, they, cannot, get, to, these,

tropes:, simile, concrete, like, rib-bones, calling, at, random, like, frail, relations, Caulked, like, great, whales, Will, dress, them, as, friends,  , metaphor, they, are, very, impatient,, the, buildings, having, much, in, them, of, the, heavy, surf, of, the, North, Sea, the, cliffs..., more, burdensome, the, cliffs..., underwritten.., with, past, days, days..glinting,, obdurate, days, part, of, the, silicate, of, tough, lives, almost, vacuumed, afternoons, a, neuralgia, calling, at, random, webs, of, buildings.., are, always, aware, buildings..., dress, them, as, friends,, pleading, and,

part, of, the, silicate, of, tough, lives, lives, tough,, distant, and, intricate, as, whirring, bureaucrats., Finally,, the, passage, tropes:, hyperbole, (overstatement), as, you'd, expect,, they, are, impatient,, the, buildings, whirring, bureaucrats, unbearable, melodies,  , aporia, (affectation, of, perplexity), do, not, know, it,, at, least, do, not, seem, to,, being, busy,, generally, become, attentive,, or, we, do...indeed, what, we, talk, about..., we,, constructing, Discussion:, Emotive, Appeal, Armed, with, this, skeleton, of, the, poem,, which, is, very, different, from, the, surface, grouping, as, six, stanzas, of, iambic, pentameters,, let, us, begin, the, diagnosis., It, is, the, extensive, use, of, parison, —, parallel, constructions, that, pick, up, a, word, and, extend, its, associations, before, drifting, on, —, that, seems, responsible, for, the, surreal,, rather, baffling, effect., The, images, appear, free-floating, and, arbitrary,, just, flat, collages, of, widely, disparate, elements,, and, they, are, not, well, anchored,, either, to, an, underlying, content, or, to, each, other., Exactly, what, does, flurrying, the, grit..., refer, to:, the, North, Sea, or, the, buildings?, And, More, burdensome,, underwritten...?, Do, these, describe, the, cliffs,, the, North, Sea, or, the, buildings?, Similarly, for, other, examples, of, parison:, days,, lives,, bureaucrats,, afternoons,, light-headedness,, architects,, webs,, whales,, hinterlands, of, glass., The, other, tropes, only, spread, the, confusion:, there, is, as, much, oxymoron, and, aporia, as, hendiadys., It, is, very, difficult, to, find, a, central, meaning,, and, it, may, be, that, the, rhetoric, obscures, any, such, meaning., Is, this, a, fault?, By, traditional, rules, it, must, certainly, appear, so., Rhetoric, organizes, language, to, evoke, emotion,, persuade, by, argument,, or, to, distract., And, often, very, subtly., Actors, learn, to, display, emotion,, but, they, do, so, by, wholly, identifying, with, the, character, they're, acting., They, do, not, say, to, themselves,, "here, comes, my, big, weepy, scene,, and, I, must, remember, to, screw, up, my, face, and, stare, tearfully, into, the, camera"., They, do, these, things, instinctively, because, they, have, learnt, by, year, after, year, of, varied, practice, how, to, sink, their, identity, into, such, a, part., Emotion, has, become, an, integral, part, of, acting,, and, is, no, longer, a, mask, donned, as, required., Even, TV, presenters,, con-men, and, salesmen, must, believe, in, their, script, to, be, convincing., No, doubt, poets, seem, at, a, disadvantage., With, their, greater, compass, of, time,, scenes, and, characters,, the, playwright, or, novelist, has, no, need, to, hit, the, target, squarely, with, the, first, shot., But, in, compensation, the, poet, is, allowed, greater, resources, of, language., Nothing, very, much, in, the, arts, is, a, raw, slice, of, life., Dialogue, in, plays, and, novels, seems, natural,, but, is, very, far, from, a, transcription, of, a, live, performance,, which, indeed, the, radio, listener, notes, immediately., Even, in, the, most, realistic, novel, the, dialogue, is, contrived, —, inevitably,, as, it, has, to, move, the, plot, along,, display, the, speaker's, character, and, motivations,, and, keep, the, reader, on, the, edge, of, his, seat., And, if, doesn't, appear, contrived,, which, it, certainly, must, not,, it, is, because, it, very, subtly, uses, various, understandings, and, conventions;, it, becomes, an, art, that, hides, art., For, the, same, reason,, the, diction, of, good, contemporary, poetry, appears, unpretentious,, deft, and, inevitable,, but, this, happy, facility, comes, from, a, good, deal, of, talent,, a, training, of, the, ear, and, endless, practice., Clearly, the, facility, is, not, spontaneous, or, we'd, find, it, more, widely, displayed,, even, in, everyday, speech., The, issue, is, one, of, conventions,, what, an, audience, will, accept, as, convincing,, and, it, is, this, matter, that, commonly, lies, behind, the, proselytizing, for, naturalness, in, poetic, language., Their, practitioners, are, seeking, to, widen, the, acceptance, of, the, own, conventions,, since, it, is, through, such, new, conventions, that, their, work, comes, across.,  , Be, that, as, it, may,, how, does, the, poem, fare?, Does, it, tap, the, well-pools, of, emotion,, and, obey, the, orator's, maxims., Not, at, all., The, subject, matter, is, remote, from, everyday, concerns., The, stance, is, not, direct., The, argument, floats, vaguely, on, through, associations,, and, employs, far, too, many, images., Is, that, the, end, of, the, matter:, the, poem, fails, by, the, standards, of, classical, rhetoric,, and, can, only, be, one, of, these, intriguing, but, ultimately, unsatisfying, Postmodernist, creations?, Perhaps, so,, but, there, is, still, one, aspect, of, rhetoric, that, may, prove, enlightening:, rhetoric, as, distraction., Rhetoric, as, Entertainment, and, Distraction, Rhetoric, was, an, art,, and, was, often, enjoyed, as, such:, a, sophisticated, audience, saw, through, the, devices, but, nonetheless, applauded, the, display, of, such, skills., Nor, was, this, an, admission, of, defeat,, even, for, poetry., New, Criticism, focused, on, the, literary, devices, employed., Postmodernism, denies, that, anything, exists, beyond, such, devices,, poetry, being, a, self-conscious, and, superior, form, of, entertainment., And, in, such, entertainment, the, illustration, —, exemplum, in, rhetoric, —, sometimes, became, more, important, than, the, argument., The, correlate, was, seen, as, vivid, and, engrossing, in, its, own, right,, which, enabled, the, speaker, or, writer, to, smuggle, in, matter, that, had, little, to, do, with, his, theme., Instead, of, the, argument, proceeding, step, by, step,, with, each, step, illustrated,, the, illustrations, themselves, linked, to, develop, subsidiary, themes,, or, distract, from, weaknesses, in, the, central, argument., Something, similar, is, used, in, TV, adverts:, we, enjoy, the, visual, display, without, believing, or, even, remembering, the, message., Poetry, employing, this, technique, became, very, oblique,, if, not, somewhat, rambling,, but, produced, surprising, effects:, Milton's, extended, similes, that, add, grandeur, to, Paradise, Lost,, Byron's, irrepressible, digressions, in, Don, Juan., If, the, images, have, no, connection, with, the, theme,, then, of, course, they, are, simply, decoration, (which, a, less, austere, age, was, quite, happy, to, accept), but, in, this, modest, poem, the, images, do, add, to, the, total, effect., Indeed, they, are, vital., Baldly, stated,, without, these, beguiling, illustrations,, the, argument, of, the, poem, is, very, unconvincing,, even, preposterous., Show, me!, says, the, sceptical, reader,, and, it, is, these, images,, coloured, by, moods, and, associations,, that, do, duty, for, reason., Published, Examples, Lilian, Feder's, John, Dryden's, Use, of, Classical, Rhetoric, (1954), Walter, Nash's, Tennysonian,

Contemporary, poems, do, not, use, rhetoric, explicitly,, and, Postmodernist, poems, —, of, which, this, is, arguably, an, example, —, generally, dislike, its, organizing, powers., Changes, involve, radical, rewriting,, and, would, affect, the, whole, nature, of, the, piece., But, if, the, poem, is, to, be, more, directly, understood,, and, achieve, a, stronger, emotional,, then, the, following,
