Lodging:, Bed, and, Breakfast,, Hostel,, Hotel,, Inn,, Motel,, Resort,, Vacation, Rental, Navigational, Links, between, Regional, and, Recreation/Travel, Purpose, of, Travel, Guidelines, These, guidelines, are, designed, to, assist, placing, and, describing, travel, sites,, and, to, supplement, the, ODP, Guidelines,, Regional, Guidelines,, and, the, Regional, Template., These, guidelines, address, the, two, primary, difficulties, that, editors, have, when, dealing, with, travel, sites:, Aggressive, Submissions, and, Multiple, Listings, -, Owners, and, promoters, of, travel, sites, are, among, the, most, aggressive, submitters, to, the, Directory, (re:, spam)., These, guidelines, are, aimed, at, addressing, spam, from, the, travel, industries,, and, to, help, editors, handle, these, sites, consistently., Travel, Ontology, -, Many, editors, have, difficulty, deciding, where, to, list, travel, sites., These, guidelines, address, this, issue, by, reviewing, different, classes, of, travel, sites, and, discussing, where, they, are, listed., Top, Scope:, Which, Categories, are, Affected?, Travel, sites, are, generally, listed, in, three, places, in, the, Directory:, Recreation:, Travel, Topical, travel, categories, -, like, Sports:, Cycling:, Travel, or, Recreation:, Travel:, Specialty_Travel:, Backpacking., These, categories, generally, either, live, in, Recreation:, Travel:, Specialty_Travel, or, are, @linked, there., Travel, categories, that, may, exist, outside, Regional, or, the, Recreation/Travel, branch, are, treated, the, same., Travel_and_Tourism, categories, at, all, levels, of, the, Regional, branch., Top, Aggressive, Submissions, and, Multiple, Listings, Owners, and, promoters, of, travel, sites, are, among, the, most, aggressive, submitters, to, the, Directory., It, is, common, for, sites, to, be, submitted, multiple, times, in, one, or, more, categories., It, is, very, important, that, editors, of, travel, categories, are, aware, of, these, practices., How, Many, Listings?, -, Provide, they, meet, the, general, guidelines, for, inclusion,, travel, sites, are, generally, listed, once, in, the, Directory,, most, often, in, the, appropriate, Regional, category., In, some, cases,, a, site, may, be, entitled, to, one, listing, in, a, Regional, category, and, a, second, listing, in, either, Recreation/Travel, or, a, topical, travel, category., Specific, information, for, each, type, of, site, can, be, found, below., Deeplinks,, Mirrors,, and, Affiliates, -, Travel, sites, aggressively, employ, these, tactics, in, an, attempt, to, obtain, multiple, listings., Editors, should, not, list, sites, which, do, not, offer, unique, content., Travel, affiliates, are, an, especially, large, management, problem;, editors, can, find, assistance, using, internal, tools., Spam, -, ODP, Guidelines, for, dealing, with, spam, are, clear:, "Sites, that, repeatedly, or, persistently, spam, the, directory, will, be, blocked, from, submission,, and, their, sites, may, be, removed, from, the, directory.", Top, Topical, Travel, Categories, Topical, travel, categories, list, resources,, directories,, tips, and, advice,, travelogues,, travel, agents,, tour, operators,, and, other, travel, providers, which, are, specific, to, a, type, of, travel., These, categories, may, "live", in, Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel, (i.e., Recreation:, Travel:, Specialty_Travel:, Backpacking), or, in, topical, categories, throughout, the, Directory, (i.e., Sports:, Cycling:, Travel)., The, same, guidelines, apply, regardless, of, where, they, are, located., Larger, topical, travel, categories, should, be, subcategorized, into, more, specific, subtopics., For, example,, the, Ecotourism, travel, category, is, further, subcategorized, by, topic., When, all, possible, subtopics, have, been, exhausted,, large, categories, should, be, further, subcategorized, using, the, following, standard, subcategories:, Destinations, -, Use, this, for, arranging, sites, by, geographical, region., Guides, and, Directories, -, Use, this, for, travel, guides,, portals,, or, directories, which, focus, exclusively, on, the, particular, type, of, topical, travel., Lodging, -, Lodging, establishments, ranging, from, resorts, to, hotels, to, bed, and, breakfasts., Rarely, would, topical, categories, have, a, need, for, this, subcategory,, as, most, lodging, is, not, topically, specific., News, and, Media, -, Use, this, for, news,, publications,, and, similar, sites, focussing, specifically, on, a, particular, type, of, travel., Travel, Agents, -, Only, travel, agents, whose, primary, focus, is, the, particular, specialty, travel, should, be, listed, here., Travel, agents, that, will, book, travel, of, this, form, as, part, of, a, larger, business, do, not, qualify, Tour, Operators, -, Only, tour, operators, whose, primary, focus, is, tours, of, a, particular, specialty, should, be, listed, here., Tour, operators, that, offer, tours, of, this, type, as, part, of, a, larger, business, do, not, qualify., Travelogues, -, Travelogues, which, focus, on, one, or, more, trips, of, this, specialty, form, may, be, listed, here., These, subcategories, should, be, linked, back, to, the, corresponding, Recreation/Travel, subcategory, with, an, @link/relcat, pair., For, example,, the, Backpacking, Travelogues, category, contains, a, related, category, link, to, Recreation:, Travel:, Travelogues,, and, the, latter, contains, an, @link, named, Backpacking@, pointing, to, the, former., Further, subcategorization, of, these, standard, topical, travel, subcategories, should, not, be, done,, except, by, geographic, area, as, a, last, resort., Editors, should, use, their, discretion, and, common, sense, when, applying, these, standard, subcategories., Not, all, subcategories, will, be, appropriate, for, all, topics., Further,, editors, may, create, additional, subcategories, at, their, discretion., Remember,, good, editors, doen't, strictly, adhere, to, rules, and, regulations,, rather, they, use, guidelines, as, basis, for, good, common, sense, judgment., Top, Site, Placement, Guidelines, Guidelines, in, this, section, are, intended, to, assist, with, the, placement, of, travel, sites, by, their, type., Editors, should, use, their, discretion, to, make, exceptions, to, these, guidelines, where, it, makes, sense., Lodging, Recreation/Travel, Listing, Criteria, Lodging, directories, which, cover, more, than, one, continent,, or, sites, for, global, lodging, chains., Regional/../Travel_and_Tourism, Listing, Criteria, Lodging, directories, which, focus, on, one, continent,, one, country,, one, state/province/county,, or, one, locality, should, be, placed, in, the, corresponding, Regional/../Lodging, category., Individual, lodging, establishments, -, including, hotels,, motels,, inns,, vacation, rentals,, bed, and, breakfast, establishments,, hostels,, resorts,, and, other, "specialized", lodging, -, should, be, listed, once, in, the, directory, in, a, Regional, category., In, larger, English, speaking, countries,, lodging, establishments, are, listed, in, Lodging, categories, of, the, locality, cat, where, the, establishment, is, physically, located., In, smaller, countries, and, those, where, English, is, not, the, primary, language,, lodging, establishments, are, usually, listed, in, categories, encompassing, a, larger, geographic, area, when, there, are, not, (yet), enough, sites, to, create, a, locality, category., In, general,, deeplinked, lodging, pages, on, travel, affiliate, sites, should, not, be, listed., Editors, should, always, attempt, to, locate, the, "official", site, for, a, lodging, establishment., Top, Travel, Agents, Recreation/Travel, Listing, Criteria, Recreation:, Travel:, Travel_Agents, is, primarily, an, @link, farm., Few, sites, are, listed, here., Topical, Travel, Categories, Listing, Criteria, Travel, agents, which, specialize, exclusively, in, a, particular, type, of, travel, may, be, listed, once, in, a, topical, travel, category, that, corresponds, to, that, specialty., Specialty, travel, agents, may, only, be, listed, once, in, a, Topical, branch,, and, once, in, Regional, (if, appropriate)., Travel, agents, offering, a, variety, of, travel, packages,, etc., should, not, be, listed, in, topical, travel, categories., These, travel, agents, should, be, listed, in, Regional, categories, only., Regional/../Travel_and_Tourism, Listing, Criteria, Travel, agents, with, a, physical, presence, should, be, listed, in, Regional, according, to, the, Regional, guidelines,, most, commonly, in, a, locality's, Regional/../Travel_Agents, category., The, vast, majority, of, travel, agents, will, be, listed, once, in, the, Directory, in, the, most, appropriate, Regional, category., Top, Tour, Operators, Recreation/Travel, Listing, Criteria, Recreation:, Travel:, Tour_Operators, is, primarily, an, @link, farm., Few, sites, -, those, which, offer, non-specialty, tours, with, a, global, scope, -, are, listed, here., Topical, Travel, Category, Listing, Criteria, Tour, operators, which, specialize, exclusively, in, a, particular, travel, specialty, may, be, listed, in, a, topical, travel, category, that, corresponds, to, that, specialty., Tour, operators, should, be, listed, no, more, than, once, in, the, Topical, area, of, the, directory., Tour, operators, whose, only, "specialty", is, that, they, offer, regionally-based, tours, should, not, be, listed, in, topical, travel, categories., These, tour, operators, should, be, listed, in, Regional, categories, only., Regional/../Travel_and_Tourism, Listing, Criteria, Tour, operators, with, a, physical, presence, should, be, listed, in, Regional, according, to, Regional, guidelines,, most, commonly, in, a, locality's, Regional/../Tour_Operators, category., In, addition,, tour, operators, may, also, be, listed, in, Regional, according, to, where, they, offer, tours,, assuming, they, have, a, specific, focus. , The, listing, description, should,, ideally,, state, where, the, company, is, based., Example:, A, tour, operator, based, out, of, Toronto, which, only, offers, tours, in, Kenya, may, be, listed, in, both, the, Toronto, and, Kenya, Tour_Operators, categories., Subdividing, Tour_Operators, categories:, Keep, all, tour, operator, sites, listed, in, the, same, category,, with, descriptions, which, make, it, clear, what, types, of, tours, they, provide,, and, where, they, are, based, and, the, region, where, they, offer, tours., This, method, may, result, in, a, very, large, number, of, sites, in, a, single, category., In, such, cases,, editors, may, use, their, discretion, to, create, subcategories., The, primary, logical, division, should, be, between, tour, operators, which, offer, tours, in, the, given, regional, area,, and, those, which, are, based, there, but, offer, tours, elsewhere, in, the, world., The, former, group, of, sites, should, reside, at, the, root, level,, while, the, latter, group, should, be, placed, in, an, Outbound, subcategory., Example:, Regional/../Kenya/T&T/Tour_Operators, would, hold, sites, for, tour, operators, that, offer, tours, in, Kenya,, whether, they, are, locally, based,, or, based, elsewhere, ("inbound", operators)., Regional/../Kenya/T&T/Tour_Operators/Outbound, would, list, sites, for, tour, operators, based, in, Kenya, which, offer, tours, only, outside, of, Kenya, ("outbound", operators)., Depending, on, the, region,, it, may, be, possible, to, subdivide, by, the, type, of, tour, offered., For, example,, one, could, create, subcategories, for, walking, tours,, museum, tours,, or, adventure, tours., In, rare, cases,, it, may, be, desirable, to, further, subdivide., At, this, time,, it, is, appropriate, to, divide, into, Local, (for, tour, operators, based, locally), and, Incoming, (for, tour, operators, based, outside, of, the, region), subcategories., Top, Air, Travel, Recreation/Travel, Listing, Criteria, All, airports, should, be, listed, in,

appropriate, Regional/../Transportation, category,, often, at, the, Metro, Area, or, county/region, level,, but, sometimes, at, the, locality, level., Editors, should, use, their, discretion., Airlines, may, also, be, listed, in, a, country, level, category., If, such, a, category, exists,, it, should, then, be, @linked, in, Recreation/Travel/../Airlines., Top, Other, Modes, of, Transportation, Recreation/Travel, Listing, Criteria, In, general,, only, companies, which, serve, multiple, continents, (like, global, car, rental, companies), are, listed, in, Recreation/Travel/Transportation, categories., Most, sites, for, transportation, companies, are, listed, in, Business, categories, which, are, then, linked, in, Recreation/Travel, with, @links., Regional/../Travel_and_Tourism, Listing, Criteria, Companies, with, a, limited, regional, scope, should, be, listed, in, the, most, specific, Regional, category, according, to, the, Regional,

Regional., This, is, consistent, with, the, Regional-topical, guidelines., Top, Attractions, Recreation/Travel, Listing, Criteria, Generally,, attractions, are, not, listed, in, Recreation/Travel, categories., Recreation:, Travel:, Attractions, contains, @links, to, several, topical, categories,, including, those, for, Zoos, and, Aquariums,, Theme_Parks,, Museums,, and, several, others., Sites,

global,, or, root,, category, for, Travel_and_Tourism, categories, in, Regional., Therefore,, it, is, important, that, editors, create, navigational, links, to, help, users, navigate, from, the, "global", category, all, the, way, down, to, the, lowest, geographic, levels, in, the, Regional, branch, (e.g., locality)., Such, navigation, helps, proper, site, placement, by, editors, and,

Travel_and_Tourism/Lodging, categories,, like, Europe's,, contains, a, related, category, link, back, to, Recreation:, Travel:, Lodging., Each, Regional/../Travel_and_Tourism, category, should, contain, @links, to, the, corresponding, subcategory, in, narrower, Regional, categories,, if, they, exist., Example:, Canada's, Lodging, category, contains, @links, to, the, Lodging, categories, of, each, of, its, provinces, (which, are, narrower, in, scope)., Each, Regional/../Travel_and_Tourism, category, should, contain, a, related, category, (relcat), link, to, the, corresponding, subcategory, in, wider, Regional, category(ies),, if, they, exist., Example:, Canada's, Lodging, category, contains, a, related, category, link, to, the, North, American, Lodging, category, (which, is, wider, in, scope)., The, goal, of, such, linking, is, to, ensure, that, it, is, possible, to, traverse, these, links, all, the, way, from, Recreation/Travel, categories, to, individual, locality, cats, (via, @links), and, back, again, (via, relcats)., Last, update:, Sat, Aug, 25, 10:35, EDT, 2012, Copyright, ©, 2016, AOL, Inc., (Terms, of, Use, -, License)]
