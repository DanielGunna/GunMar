[Search, this, site:, Home, &, Garden, Kitchen, Fitness, &, Sports, Computers, &, Electronics, Family, &, Pets, Health, &, Beauty, Home, About, Us, About, Us, Our, Mission:, To, eliminate, the, dreaded, “buyer’s, remorse”, by, recommending, the, right, product, for, any, lifestyle, and, budget., We, do, that, by, evaluating, product, reviews, to, be, sure, only, those, that, are, authentic, and, trustworthy, are, factored, into, our, final, recommendations., Our, History:, ConsumerSearch, was, founded, in, 1999, with, the, sole, mission, of, cutting, through, much, of, the, hype, and, hyperbole, that, surrounded, the, then-new, world, of, internet, retail, sales., We, found, that, by, personally, examining, all, available, reviews,, and, winnowing, out, the, information, that, was, obviously, biased, or, self-serving,, we, could, find, the, products, that, truly, do, what, they, say, they, will, do., This, enables, us, to, recommend, the, top, products, in, a, range, of, categories, for, a, variety, of, budgets, and, lifestyles,, thus, saving, time,, money, and, disappointment, for, millions, of, consumers, Our, Process:, The, editors, and, writers, at, ConsumerSearch, thoroughly, research, every, single, product, category, they, are, responsible, for., Research, includes, online, sources,, searching, journal, and, magazine, databases,, and, personally, examining, thousands, of, owner, reviews, to, include, only, the, most, relevant., We, do, not, accept, donations, or, free, products, from, manufacturers,, which, makes, us, entirely, impartial, and, unbiased., All, of, our, reports, include, a, detailed, analysis, of, each, of, our, recommendations., The, top, products, we, dub, the, “Best, Reviewed.”, However,, we, understand, that, one, product, does, not, work, for, everyone,, so, we, offer, alternatives., These, runners, up, may, be, less, expensive,, or, an, alternate, size,, or, fit, a, different, specific, need,, but, we, try, to, cover, all, the, bases, for, any, lifestyle., The, Team:,  , Damon, McClure,, General, Manager, Damon, has, been, with, ConsumerSearch, since, the, very, beginning, and, has, held,

into, the, science, behind, our, health, and, beauty, reports,, like, multivitamins,, diets,, diet, supplements,, and, creams, and, lotions., Companies, can, make, big, claims, --, and, make, big, bucks, off, of, those, claims, --, but, the, facts, often, beg, to, differ., I, feel, like, a, big, part, of, my, job, is, to, reject, the, hype, and, present, just, the, facts, so, consumers, can, make, the, most, informed, decision.”,  , Edward, Lawrence,, Lead, Developer, Edward, is, the, most, recent, addition, to, the, ConsumerSearch, team., With, more, than, 10, years, of, technical,
