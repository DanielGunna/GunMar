the, 20C., Friday, A, New, Book, and, Additions, in, 2016-17, The, Tansey, Collection, -A, New, Book, Recently, published, is, another, excellent, book, with, a, dual, commentary, in, German, and, English,, edited, by, Bernd, Pappe, and, titled,, Miniaturen, der, Barockzeit, aus, der, Sammlung, Tansey, or, Miniatures, from, the, Baroque, Period, in, the, Tansy, Collection,, Munich,, Albert, Hirmer,, 2016,, 395pp., This, is, the, sixth, book, in, a, series, documenting, the, Tansey, Collection, as, assembled, by, the, German-American, couple,, Lieselotte, and, Ernest, Tansey., They, formed, the, basis, of, their, collection, almost, fifty, years, ago., It, grew, into, one, of, the, world's, largest, and, most, significant, collections, of, this, art, form., In, 2016, the, collection, was, generously, donated, to, The, Tansy, Miniatures, Foundation., Sadly, Lieselotte, died, in, June, 2016, but, she, is, remembered, via, the, collection,, which, is, available, to, view, by, the, public, and, celebrated, in, descriptive, works, such, as, this. , This, volume, depicts, 120, miniatures,, representing, examples, from, the, Baroque, period,, each, with, a, colour, image, and, description, in, German, and, English., For, those, seeking, a, copy, is, available, at, Miniaturen, des, Barock, aus, der, Sammlung, Tansey, |, Hirmer, Verlag, Artists, and, Ancestors, Collection, In, view, of, the, outstanding, quality, of, the, Tansey, Collection,, it, is, a, little, disconcerting, to, discuss, recent, additions, to, this, collection, on, the, same, page., However,, it, is, necessary, to, keep, a, record, and, demonstrate, that, interesting, miniatures, can, still, be, acquired, for, private, collections, at, relatively, modest, cost., Due, to, the, time, pressures, of, my, major, research, project,, The, Lost, Works, of, Tobias, Smollett,, see,, The, Lost, Works, of, Tobias, Smollett, and, the, War, of, the, Satirists, miniature, portraits, have, tended, to, take, a, back, seat, with, very, few, additions, in, 2016-17., However,, for, the, record, they, include., Lady, Elizabeth, St, George, Unknown, -, Portrait, of, Lady, St, George, The, artist, who, painted, this, late, 18C, miniature, portrait, is, unknown,, but, it, is, of, typical, "modest, school", size., It, may, be, by, an, Irish, artist., The, miniature, is, inscribed, on, the, reverse:, "Lady, St, George, -, Widow, of, Usher,, last, Lord, St, George, of, Hatley, -, She, was, Miss, Dominick, cousin, to, Mr, Gale;, left, a, daughter, and, sole, heiress,, Olivia,, Duchess, of, Leinster.", That, has, enabled, a, more, precise, identification, of, the, sitter, as,, Elizabeth, Dominick, (c1732-1813),, daughter, of, Sir, Christopher, Dominick, (died, 1743),, a, wealthy, Dublin, doctor, who, began, the, laying, out, of, Dominick, Street, in, Dublin., On, her, marriage, she, became, Elizabeth, Usher, St., George,, i.e., Lady, St, George, as, depicted, here,, and, she, died, aged, 18, on, February, 26,, 1813. , ds, 1509, Her, husband, was, St, George, St, George,, 1st, Baron, St, George, (circa, 1715, –, 2, January, 1775),, who, was, an, Irish, politician., Born, St, George, Ussher,, he, was, the, son, of, John, Ussher, by, his, wife, Mary, St, George,, daughter, of, George, St, George,, 1st, Baron, St, George., He, succeeded, his, father, as, Member, of, Parliament, for, Carrick, in, the, Irish, House, of, Commons, from, 1741, until, he, was, raised, to, the, Irish, House, of, Lords., He, was, created, Baron, St, George, of, Hatley, St, George,, in, the, Peerage, of, Ireland,, on, 19, April, 1763;, this, was, a, revival, of, the, title, held, by, his, grandfather., He, died, without, surviving, male, issue,, so, the, title, became, extinct. , Emilia,, Duchess, of, Leinster, In, 1772, was, read, in, the, House, of, Commons, of, the, Kingdom, of, Ireland, , "A, Bill, intitled, an, Act, for, ratifying, and, confirming, certain, Leases, for, Lives,, renewable, for, ever,, of, certain, Grounds, in, and, adjoining, to, Dominick-street,, in, the, City, of, Dublin,, made, by, the, Right, Honourable, Usher, Lord, St, George,, Baron, of, Hatley, St, George,, and, Elizabeth, Lady, St, George,, his, Wife,, against, them,, and, against, the, Issue, of, their, Bodies,, and, all, Person, or, Persons, claiming,, or, to, claim, under, the, Settlement, made, upon, their, Intermarriage,, was, presented, to, the, House, and, read, the, first, Time,, and, ordered, to, be, read, a, second, Time, Tomorrow, Morning.",  Their, daughter, Emilia, Olivia, FitzGerald, (c1755-1798),, as, indicated, in, the, inscription,, later, married, William, FitzGerald,, 2nd, Duke, of, Leinster,, and, had, several, children. , Somewhat, sadly,, Emilia,, Duchess, of, Leinster,, predeceased, her, mother,, Lady, St, George,, by, fifteen, years., However,, it, was, nice, to, be, able, to, locate, a, portrait, of, Emilia, and, "reunite", mother, and, daughter, here., Unknown, American, Lady., Although, not, a, fine, portrait,, this, American, miniature, is, signed, BHG, 1901, or, BHC, 1901, and, a, good, example, of, the, period., To, date, it, has, not, been, possible, to, identify, the, artist,, but, the, miniature, was, purchased, at, auction, at, a, moderate, cost,, being, described, as:, "This, is, a, very, fine, watercolor, miniature, portrait, of, an, older, lady,, probably, English,, on, some, kind, of, organic, material., The, painting, is, signed, ", BH., G.", and, dated, 1901., It, is, completely, sealed, in, a, heavy, white, metal, frame, and, a, protective, concave, glass., The, painting, seems, to, be, in, perfect, condition, as, it, has, been, very, tightly, sealed, inside, the, frame, and, behind, the, display, glass.", A, bonus, on, arrival, was, the, discovery, the, case, was, sterling, silver., ds, 1511 , Man, in, blue, coat, by, George, Engleheart, George, Engleheart, -, portrait, of, an, unknown, man, This, miniature, portrait, was, described, at, auction, only, as:, "A, superb, portrait, of, a, gentleman, wearing, a, blue, coat,, a, white, stock,, and, a, grey, powered, wig., Framed, in, a, 20C, gilt, frame.", However,, from, images, accompanying, the, listing,, the, portrait, appeared, to, be, by, the, important, artist,, George, Engleheart, (1750/5-1829), and, this, attribution, was, confirmed, on, arrival., It, is, modest, sized, and, dates, to, around, 1780-90., Engleheart, did, sign, his, later, works, with, a, distinctive, "E",, but, it, is, easy, for, his, earlier, works, to, slip, though, auction, houses, without, being, recognised,, and, be, acquired, for, a, very, modest, hammer, price,, as, was, the, case, here., ds, 1513., Sir, Walter, Raleigh, by, Samuel, Percy, Samuel, Percy, -, portrait, of, Sir, Walter, Raleigh, This, wax, miniature, had, a, full, description, at, auction, as, being, Sir, Walter, Raleigh,, the, famous, Elizabethan,, but, there, was, no, comment, about, the, artist., However,, although, unsigned, it, is, believed, to, be, by, the, prominent, wax, miniaturist,, Samuel, Percy, (1750-1820), the, style, being, very, similar, to, his, other, works., Up, to, 1786, he, had, made, 800, portraits,, but, he, continued, to, make, and, exhibit, wax, miniatures, after, that, date., E, J, Pyke, records, there, is, a, wax, miniature, by, Samuel, Percy, of, Sir, Walter, Raleigh, in, the, collection, at, Windsor, Castle,, but, it, is, not, known, whether, it, is, similar, to, this, version., ds, 1514, Jacob, Interpreting, the, Baker's, Dream, Henry, Bone, -, Jacob, Interpreting, the, Baker's, Dream, Although, not, strictly, a, miniature, portrait,, this, miniature, in, enamel, was, purchased, at, a, local, auction., It, is, painted, by, the, important, artist,, Henry, Bone, (1755-1834)., It, is, 195mm, x, 210mm, so, is, large, for, an, enamel, miniature-, apologies, for, the, poor, reproduction, -, the, actual, work, is, very, well, painted., On, the, reverse, it, is, inscribed, "Painted, for, the, Duke, of, Bedford, by, Henry , Bone , R.A.,, Enamel, Painter, in, Ordinary, to, His, Majesty, and, Enamel, Painter, to, H.R.H, the, Prince, Regent,, after, the, original, picture, in, the, Collection, of, his, Grace, at, Woburn, Abbey"., In, contacting, the, picture, curator, at, Woburn, Abbey, it, was, established, that, the, original, is, no, longer, in, the, Woburn, collection,, having, been, sold, in, the, early, 1950's., However, Woburn, Abbey, has, retained, another, enamel, version, by, Henry, Bone,, but, on, a, smaller, scale, than, this, example. , The, location, of, the, original, oil, is, currently, unknown., During, the, 19C, the, original, oil, was, attributed, to, Rembrandt,, but, that, is, now, discounted., An, interesting, comparison, is, with, the, original, squared, drawing, by, Henry, Bone,, which, is, held, in, the, National, Portrait, Gallery, in, London., That, gives, a, good, idea, of, how, a, miniature, was, copied, from, a, large, sized, portrait., ds, 1515, Young, Man, by, Christian, Friedrich, Zincke, Christian, Friedrich, Zincke, -, portrait, of, a, young, man, On, a, completely, different, scale, is, this, miniature, portrait, in, enamel., At, a, local, auction, it, was, described, as:, "Lot, 310, -, A, 19thC, finely, enamelled, porcelain,, gold, framed, portrait, miniature,, the, plain, gold, frame, testing, as, 18ct., or, higher,, the, portrait, miniature, of, a, gent, wearing, a, blue, jacket,, glazed., 40mm, x, 35mm., Est., $180.", The, auction, estimate, was, very, low,, far, below, even, the, intrinsic, value, of, the, gold., However,, before, the, auction, it, was, realised, the, auction, description, was, deficient, in, other,, more, important,, respects, and, it, was, fortunately, able, to, be, acquired, for, roughly, the, intrinsic, value, of, the, gold. ,  , A, better, description, would, have, been;, "A, fine, early, 18C, portrait, miniature, in, enamel,, from, approximately, 1730,, by, the, important, and, prolific, artist,, Christian, Friedrich, Zincke, (1683/4-1767),, who, was, born, in, Dresden,, but, moved, to, England, in, 1706, and, studied, under, Charles, Boit, (1662-1727)., The, plain, gold, frame, testing, as, 18ct., or, higher,, and, the, miniature, glazed., The, unknown, sitter, is, wearing, a,

January, 2016, -, Various, additions, to, the, collection, [NB, Google, is, changing, its, procedures,, so, if, you, wish, to, follow, this, site, you, may, need, to, follow, their, new, rules] , The, miniature, portraits, depicted, here, were, purchased, for, the, Artists, and, Ancestors, collection,, but, are, mostly, examples, which, had, not, been, added, into, the, website, due, to, the, pressure, of, other, research., They, are, now, added, as, part, of, a, New, Year's, Resolution, to, try, to, get, up, to, date!, Those, depicted, represent, a, wide, range, of, artist, skills, and, variation, in, quality,, but, most, appealed, as, examples, to, represent, differing, aspects, of, miniature, collecting., Many, of, them, would, be, shunned, by, collectors, of, expensive, high, quality, miniatures,, but, the, range, shows, what, is, available, for, purchase, by, a, collector, of, more, modest, means., They, all, came, from, public, auctions, and, in, order, of, acquisition, are, as, below., ds, 1489, is, an, Italian, lady, in, provincial, costume,, where, the, detail, of, the, portrait, is, much, finer, than, can, be, seen, in, the, images., A, kind, expert, in, Italy, sent, me, the, printed, image, of, a, similar, costume,, which, shows, the, costume, comes, from, the, region, of, Salerno., What, looks, like, a, signature, is, actually, a, description., It, was, inexpensive, appealed, due, to, the, primitive,, but, finely, detailed, style,  ,  , ds , 1491, This, fairly, ordinary, looking, man, has, no, great, merit,, He, is, probably, French, and, came, from, a, local, auction, along, with, the, miniature, on, paper, by, John, Smart, previously, separately, added, to, the, website., ds, 1490, by, John, Smart, ds, 1492, This, miniature, portrait, came, from, the, same, auction, as, 1490, and, 1491., Although, not, of, high, quality, it, is, in, a, large, ornate, frame, and, interesting, as, it, shows, how, artist, used, several, pieces, of, ivory, when, they, wanted, to, paint, or, enlarge, a, large, miniature., This, one, appears, to, be, an, actress, painted, around, 1820-30,, and, an, expert, on, the, theatre, may, be, able, to, detect, the, role, or, play, depicted., The, full, sight, size, is, 175mm, by, 120mm, and, to, purchase, a, piece, of, ivory, of, that, dimension, would, have, been, very, expensive., Thus, the, main, portrait, is, 130mm, by, 110mm,, which, is, still, large, for, a, miniature., As, the, colours, vary, between, the, pieces,, the, extra, ivory, may, have, been, added, when, it, was, reframed., There, is, no, obvious, signature,, although, it, has, not, been, opened., ds, 1493, Another, miniature, of, no, great, merit,, but, interesting, for, the, level, of, detail, depicted, in, a, harbour, scene., ds, 1494, This, is, an, early, 20C, or, late, 19C, portrait, of, King, Frederick, the, Great,, of, no, great, quality,, but, unusual, as, a, wax, miniature, of, him., ds, 1495, was, added, separately, to, the, website., It, is, by, the, American, artist, Charles, Willson, Peale, and, is, a, portrait, of, Colonel, Charles, Pope., ds, 1496, This, miniature, portrait, is, of, Henry, Penny, Sale,, youngest, son, of, Sir, Robert, Sale, GCB., Although, on, paper,, it, has, an, interesting, inscription, on, the, reverse., A, bit, hard, to, read,, but, apparently:, "Henry, Penny, Sale,, youngest, son, of, Sir, Robert, Sale, GCB, and, Lady, Sale,, killed, by, a, fall, in, the, hills, near, Simla,, India,, b., 1829,, died, 1851., Lieutenant, in, the, 13th, Regiment, of, ft.., Adjutant, of, his,

Grave, at, Subathu, -, "Sacred, to, the, memory, of, Henry, Penny, Sale., Lieutt, 13th, Regt, N.I., Adjt, Nusseree, Battn, who, died, on, the, 30th, April, 1851, aged, 24, years., Deeply, regretted, by, his, family, and, friends., This, tablet, was, erected, by, his, brother, officers, as, a, token, of, their, esteem.", ds, 1497, This, miniature, of, a, young, lady , is, housed, in, a, red, leatherette, case, and, is, unusual, as, it, was, painted, in, South, Africa., On, the, reverse, it, is, signed, J., E., Ford,, Cape, Town,, 1825., Unfortunately, the, sitter, is, not, identified,, but, it, is, finely, painted,, and, interesting, as, an, indication, that, London, hair, and, clothing, fashions, of, 1825, were, quickly, repeated, in, South, Africa., Ford, flourished, 1793-1830,, and, Foskett, notes, that, Schidlof, mentioned, two, portraits, by, him., An, officer, signed, on, the, reverse, J.E., Ford,, Cape, Town, and, another, signed, on, the, reverse., J.E., Ford,, 1828., Thus, this, one, of, a, young, lady, seems, to, be, especially, unusual, in, being, signed, with, both, the, location, and, the, date.,  ,  , ds, 1498, This, miniature, portrait, of, a, young, lady, is, a, little, smaller, than, usual, for, the, time,, c.1815,, being, 50mm, by, 40mm., It, is, by, an, American, artist, and, is, in, what , I, call, a, "make-do", case., That, is, it, dates, from, about, 1815,, around, the, time, of, the, war, of, 1812,, when, the, Embargo, Act, was, in, place, which, prevented, artists, from, getting, supplies, of, new, casework, from, England., Hence, artist, were, forced, to, use, what, ever, left, over, materials, they, could, find, to, combine, and, produce, "make-do", cases., I, have, written, elsewhere, on, how, many, dealers, replace, the, cases, of, miniatures, like, this, to, make, them, more, saleable,, but, as, a, historian,, I, believe, they, should, be, retained, in, their, "make-do", cases,, as, a, more, honest, condition, and, a, reminder, of, the, interesting, history, of, events, around, the, Embargo, Act., It, was, suggested, her, married, name, was, possibly, a, Mrs, Goadlow, [Goodlow?], and, the, rear, is, engraved, with, her, initials,, presumably, when, unmarried,, JWD, or, IWD,, so, there, may, be, a, faint, chance, of, identifying, her., The, artist, is, a, puzzle,, as, the, quality, is, high,, but, not, easily, recognisable., Possibilities, include, Raphael, Peale,, as, the, background, colouring, is, similar, to, his, work,, Anson, Dickinson,, or, Hugh, Bridport., The, engraving, on, the, rear, of, the, case, is, not, common, and, the, tiny, glass, is, another, indication, of, the, Embargo, Act,, as, high, quality, glass, was, unavailable, in, America, at, the, time., The, brooch, fitting, is, broken, off,, but, is, more, recent,, perhaps, 20, years, later., ds, 1499, This, is, another, American, miniature, portrait, from, c.1820,, again, smaller, than, usual, for, the, time,, sight, size, 43mm, by, 35mm., It, is, a, good, example, of, an, early, American, designed, case,, as, a, result, of, the, Embargo, Act,, but, still, with, proper, materials, in, short, supply., When, advertised, it, was, described, as, "English, oval, framed, 1770-1790,, young, man",, but, is, definitely, later, and, American,, so, is, an, indication, that, sellers, often, have, inaccurate, descriptions., Although, the, image, is, out, of, focus,, the, artist, is, perhaps, Daniel, Dickinson, or, Thomas, Edwards., ds, 1500 , This, miniature, portrait, was, merely, described, as,, "Miniature, Etching, Of, Distinguished, Gentleman, 19th, Cent"., Hence, it, was, very, cheap., However,, it, was, immediately, obvious, as, a, Saint, Memin, portrait,, being, inscribed, at, the, foot,, "Drawn, and, Engr., by, St., Memin,, Philadd.", see, Charles, Balthazar, Julien, Févret, de, Saint-Mémin, -, Wikipedia, ..., With, such, engraved, portraits, it, is, usually, possible, to, identify, the, sitter, by, reference, to, the, book, by, Ellen, G, Miles, which, lists, hundreds, of, examples, with, their, images,, see, Saint-Mémin, and, the, neoclassical, profile, portrait, in, America, One, of, the, joys, of, collecting, miniature, portraits,, although, rarely, possible,, is, to, take, an, unidentified, sitter, and, so, to, speak, "bring, them, back, to, life". , This, one, took, a, while, to, work, through, (thankfully, his, name, was, not, Wyatt!),, before, being, matched, with, a, portrait, of, William, Poyntell,, who, died, in, 1811, and, was, an, eminent, merchant, and, publisher., There, is, an, extensive, obituary, for, him, in, The, Gentleman's, Magazine,, see, The, Gentleman's, Magazine, which, opens:, "Sept, 10, 1811, Died, at, his, house, in, Philadelphia,, in, his, 56th, year,, universally, lamented,, William, Poyntell,, esq., late, Merchant,, and, one, of, the, Select, Council, of, that, city., He, had, retired, from, business, several, years, having, acquired, an, ample, fortune,, of, which, he, merited, the, enjoyment, by, the, most, inflexible, integrity, in, all, his, dealings, and, transactions, with, whomsoever, he, was, engaged., Mr, Poyntell, was, an, Englishman,, and, his, character, holds, forth, so, bright, an, example, of, usefulness, and, private, worth,, that, we, are, persuaded, we, shall, stand, excused, for, entering, upon, it, more, at, large., He, was, born, at, Chipping, Norton, in, Oxfordshire,, and, baptized, in, the, parish, church, there,, April, 9,, 1756., ....", He, sold, stationery, and, wall, papers,, there, being, a,

from, Europe', ds, 1501, One, sitter, who, was, identified, is, in, this, silhouette, portrait,, Lord, Charlemont., There, was, a, fashion, for, a, while, of, using, a, silhouette, portrait, of, the, sitter's, face,, but, with, coloured, clothing,, often, for, those, in, uniform,, as, here., The, sitter, is, the, Earl, of, Charlemont, (1728-99),, see , James, Caulfeild,, 1st, Earl, of, Charlemont, -, Wikipedia,, the, free, ..., He, was, well, known, for, his, love, of, Classical, art, and, culture, and, spent, nine, years, on, the, Grand, Tour, in, Italy,, Greece,, Turkey, and, Egypt., He, returned, to, Dublin, and, employed, the, Scottish, architect, Sir, William, Chambers, to, remodel, his, main, residence, Marino, House,, to, design, his, town, house, Charlemont, House, and, the, unique, Neo-Classical, garden, pavilion, building,, the, Casino, at, Marino.,  ,  ,  , There, is, a, similar, image, of, him, at , James, Caulfield,, Earl, of, Charlemont, -, Library, Ireland, together, with, an, account, of, his, life., And, more, about, him, with, another, portrait, at, The, Armagh, Election, of, 1753, -, Craigavon, Historical, Societywhich, is, probably, engraved, from, an, original, oil, portrait., ds, 1502, This, miniature, of, a, young, girl, is, believed, to, be, American, for, several, reasons,, firstly, as, the, reverse, is, solid, metal, and, is, engraved, in, large, letters, HTG,, so, perhaps, her, first, name, was, Harriet., Solid, backs, on, miniatures, of, this, size,, are, occasionally, met, with, in, America,, but, practically, never, on, British, miniatures,, it, being, 71mm, by, 58mm., Although, it, is, a, very, similar, pose, to, works, by, William, Verstile, or, Lawrence, Sully,, it, may, be, too, late, for, either, of, them., Alexander, Pope, ds, 1503 , Alexander, Pope, has, become, increasingly, relevant, to, my, research, into, the, life, and, works, of, the, author,, Tobias, Smollett,, so, when, this , miniature, portrait, on, ivory, was, offered, on, Ebay, in, 2015,, as, an, "Unknown , Gentleman",, it, was, impossible, to, resist, purchasing, it., It, is, after , an, earlier, oil, portrait, of, Pope, by, Thomas, Hudson, and, is, signed, V.V.K.), Although, after, a, well, known, portrait., The, research, into, Smollett,, his, Lost, Works, ,and, the, War, of, the, Satirists, is, extensively, covered, at , The, Lost, Works, of, Tobias, Smollett, and, the, War, of, the, Satirists, and, is, the, main, reason, for, spending, so, little, time, on, miniatures., ds, 1504, This, pressed, metal, portrait,, probably, of, a, clergyman,, is, poor, quality, and, very, cheap,, but, I, had, hoped, to, identify, the, sitter, and, so, make, him, more, interesting., It, is, also, over-painted,, but, he, remains, unidentified., However,, he, must, have, been, of, some, significance, to, have, a, medal, pressed., ds, 1505, This, better, quality, pressed, metal, portrait, came, from, the, same, source., It, appears, to, be, gilded, brass, and, is, a, portrait, of, Sir, Sidney, Smith., An, extensive, account, of, his, life, is, at, Sidney, Smith, (Royal, Navy, officer), -, Wikipedia,, the, free, ... , There, it, is, noted,, Admiral, Sir, William, Sidney, Smith,, KCB,, GCTE,, KmstkSO,, FRS, (21, June, 1764, –, 26, May, 1840), was, a, British, naval, officer., Serving, in, the, American, and, French, revolutionary, wars,, he, later, rose, to, the, rank, of, admiral., Napoleon, Bonaparte,, reminiscing, later, in, his, life,, said, of, him:, "That, man, made, me, miss, my, destiny", He, was, also, active, against, the, slave, trade. , ds, 1506, Continuing, the, naval, theme, is, this, miniature, portrait, of, Lord, Louis, Mountbatten, by, Dorothy, Turton,, for, Dorothy, Barbara, Jessie, Turton, RMS, (1900-1900s)., Men, in, uniform, are, obviously, much, more, colourful, than, those, dressed, in, drab, black, coats, of, the, 19C,, but, what, is, not, immediately, realised,, is, that, those, in, uniform, take, a, lot, longer, to, paint,, especially, when,, as, here,, there, are, many, decorations,, and, a, very, detailed, uniform. , The, colouring, of, miniatures, goes, through, fashions, like, many, other, things, and, this, one, is, not, as, reddish, as, appears, in, the, photo., The, inscription, on, the, rear, reads:, Lord, Louis, Mountbattern,, 1979,, Dorothy, Turton,, £130,, RMS,, Exhibited, in, 1986, in, The, Mall, Galleries,, The, Mall,, London. , That, was, a, lot, of, money, at, the, time, of, 1979,, which, reflects, the, time , that, must, have, been, spent, by, Dorothy, Turton, on, the, detail,, but, only, a, little, different, than, the, price, it, was, able, to, be, acquired, at, for, this, collection., For, much, more, about, Mountbatten, who, was, killed, in, a, bomb, explosion, on, 27, August, 1979,, see, Louis, Mountbatten,, 1st, Earl, Mountbatten, of, Burma, -, Wikipedia, This, portrait, was, presumably, painted, soon, after, he, died, as, a, copy, from, this, large, oil., ds, 1507, This, miniature, portrait, was, offered, at, a, local, auction, with, no, description, other, than, being, a, portrait, of, a, man. , However,, he, was, interesting, to, me, as, I, was, able, to, read, the, faint, writing, on, the, reverse, as, reading,, "F.H., Bischoff,, Painted, by, hinself.", Foskett, says, only, of, him, "Bischoff,, F.H., (fl., 1823-49), Of, London., Exhibited, at, the, R.A., 1823-49., His, address, was, in, 1823, was, 176, Sloan, Street,, Knightsbridge.", This, made, him, doubly, interesting,, firstly, as, self-portraits, are, always, special, and,, secondly,, the, name, Bischoff,, as, there, are, other, portraits, and, items, in, this, collection, by, Bischoff, which, were, also, purchased, locally, several, years, ago., In, particular, in, the, collection, there, is, a, RA, token, engraved, with, the, name, of, Charles, Ferdinand, Bischoff, (1820-1898),, the, son, of, the, artist, F, H, Bischoff., Here, are, the, front, and, reverse, of, his, ivory, ticket, to, the, Royal, Academy., On, the, front, is, written, "Royal, Academy, Antique, School, 1768", and, on, the, reverse, "Chas, Ferdinand, Bischoff, -, Admitted, 12th, Dec'r, 1840"., ds, 1508, The, final, portrait, for, the, year, was, not, the, least., For, some, reason, the, auctioneers, attributed, it, to, John, Smart,, but, it, was, immediately, clear, it, was, an, early, miniature, portrait, by, George, Engleheart, (1750-1829)., The, sight, size, is, only, 39mm, by, 33mm, and, it, was, offered, in, an, ordinary, ebonised, frame., However,, inside, it, was, still, in, its, original, bracelet, fitting., The, miniature, is, from, his, second, period, 1780-95,, when, he, tended, not, to, sign, his, work, and, was, the, period, of, which, Foskett, writes,, "his, full, powers, developed,, his, colouring, became, strong,, his, draughtsmans, hip, was, good, and, although, he, still, used, small, ivories,, the, quality, of, the, work, was, excellent."  , It, is, not, expected, to, have, as, many, additions, during, 2016., Posted, by, Don, Shelton, at, 7:22, PM, 2, comments:, Wednesday, August, 2015, -, A, new, book, An, apology, for, the, lack, of, new, posts, here,, although, that, is, not, a, sign, of, an, idle, computer., The, research, into, the, 18C, author, Tobias, Smollett, (1721-71), occupies, me, for, several, hours, a, day,, and, so, far, about, 400,000, words, of, new, research, have, been, added, to, the, website, dedicated, to, Smollett., to, his, Lost,, i.e., unrecognised,, Works,, and, to, the, War, of, the, Satirists, involving, Smollett,, Alexander, Pope,, Colley, Cibber,, Henry, Fielding,, and, William, Hogarth,, see, The, Lost, Works, of, Tobias, Smollett, and, the, War, of, the, Satirists, Even, so,, I, believe, the, research, is, still, less, than, half, complete., In, a, nutshell,, the, Smollett, Project, is, a, huge, cryptic, crossword,, one, which, seeks, to, determine, which, anonymous, or, pseudonymous, (a/p), works, published, in, 1737-70, were, authored, or, edited, by, Tobias, Smollett., For, 1732-66, The, London, Magazine, lists, about, 20,000, books,, pamphlets,, and, prints,, published, in, English,, of, which, about, half, were, anonymous, or, pseudonymous., In, addition, there, were, thousands, of, essays,, letters,, reviews,, and, sundry, items, in, periodicals, or, newspapers., But, no, one, has, ever, reviewed, them,, in, a, detailed,, careful,, methodical,, and, logical, manner,, looking, for, a/p, works, by, Smollett,, even, though, Smollett, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, most, prolific, authors, of, the, 18C., The, process, is, akin, to, the, work, of, an, art, historian, who, studies, unsigned, paintings, in, detail,, in, order, to, attribute, an, artist, to, the, painting, and/or, to, identify, a, sitter.,  , I, acknowledge, it, will, take, several, years, until, "conventional, wisdom", accepts, that, a, revision, of, Smollett's, canon, is, required,, but, the, evidence, supporting, all, the, new, attributions, to, him, has, been, tabled, and, is, available, for, academic, scrutiny., Some, scrutiny, has, obviously, started,, as, the, page, views, recorded, for, that, website, are, steadily, rising., [I, recently, decided, to, add, up, page, views, across, all, my, interconnected, websites,, including, Smollett,, to, see, what, the, combined, total, was,, and, was, staggered, to, find, total, page, views, were, over, 750,000.], The, Tobias, Smollett, research, overlaps, with, many, of, Smollett's, contemporaries, and, today,, as, part, of, my, research, into, William, Smellie,, I, came, across, this, pithy, observation, by, John, Glaister,, in, his, 1894, biography, of, William, Smellie,, which, I, cannot, resist, sharing!, "It, is, probably, almost, a, truism, to, say, that, no, man, who, tries, to, reform, the, existing, order, of, things, by, teaching, or, otherwise, escapes, criticism,, and, that, in, most, cases, the, amount, and, persistency, of, the, criticism, evoked, are, in, direct, ratio, to, the, value, of, his, work., This, can, be, found, abundantly, illustrated, in, history.",  , However,, enough, of, Tobias, Smollett, as, I, have, recently, received, a, copy, of, a, major, new, book, on, the, subject, of, miniature, portraits,, which, will, be, of, more, interest, to, visitors, here., It, is, another, wonderful, production, by, Bernd, Pappe,, drawing, on, the, extensive, and, generous, resources, of, the, Louvre, Museum, and, of, the, Tansey, Foundation., This, time, it, is, a, fantastic,, detailed,, and, well, illustrated, monograph, on, Jean-Baptiste, Jacques, Augustin, (1759-1832),, one, of, the, very, best, of, French, miniature, painters, of, the, late, 18C, and, early, 19C., The, book, is, of, 384, pages,, comprising, 130, pages, of, text, and, notes,, followed, by, 100, pages, of, full, colour, illustrations, of, Augustin's, best, works,, and, then, by, a, catalogue, of, over, 1200, works, by, Augustin,, each, with, a, small, black, and, white, image, for, reference, purposes., I, have, also, included, here, an, enlarged, version, of, Augustin's, miniature, self-portrait, which, serves, as, the, frontispiece,, and, which, is, simply, stunning!, The, image, truly, proves, the, adage, that, if, a, good, miniature, portrait,, by, a, master, of, the, art,, is, enlarged, to, life,, or, oil, portrait, size,, it, will, not, be, possible, to, tell, that, it, has, been, so, enlarged., Miniature, portraits, are, generally, treated, as, the, "poor, relations", of, large, oils,, but, in, my, opinion, there, was, far, more, skill, required, for, a, miniature, painted, in, watercolour,, gouarche,, or, in, enamel,, than, there, was, for, an, oil, portrait;, where, any, slip, of, the, brush, was, easily, wiped, away,, or, else, covered, by, a, new, layer, of, oil, paint,, so, that, x-rays, can, now, reveal, where, the, portraitist, had, changed, his, or, her, mind.  , Most, of, the, examples, depicted, in, the, book, are, in, public, or, private, collections, and, so, will, never, be, available, for, purchase,, but, as, a, reference, book, and, catalogue, of, the, work, of, Augustin,, the, book, is, invaluable, as, a, means, of, comparing, and, contrasting, his, work, with, other, masters, of, the, art, of, miniature, portrait, painting., Posted, by, Don, Shelton, at, 7:29, PM, No, comments:, Thursday, February, 2015, -, New, literary, research, -, Tobias, Smollett, 18C, English, Literature, Apologies, to, patient, people,

research, effort, has, increasingly, been, directed, at, 18C, English, Literature., While, there, remains, a, great, deal, more, to, do,, I, have, now, started, to, post, the, research, on, a, new, website., Click, on, this, link, to, reach, it:, The, Lost, Works, of, Tobias, Smollett, and, the, War, of, the, Satirists, After, reading, all, the, evidence, tabled, here,, it, would, be, interesting, to, hear, opinions, on, whether, the, website, discusses, what, may, become, considered, as, the, greatest, literary, discovery, for, many, years??, So, far,, over, 250,, now, nearly, 300,, anonymous, and, pseudonymous, books,, pamphlets,, and, satirical, prints,, amounting, to, over, 25,000, pages, of, 18C, literature,, which, have, lain, unresearched, for, 275, years,, have, been, newly, attributed, to, Smollett., The, 25,000, pages, are, accompanied, by, discussion, of, previously, unrecognised, satires, by, Hogarth,, Fielding,, and, Pope. , If, you,, your, friends,, or, colleagues, have, any, interest, in, Tobias, Smollett,, Henry, Fielding,, William, Hogarth,, Colley, Cibber,, Alexander, Pope,, or, the, London, Theatre, in, 1735-60,, there, will, be, much, to,

Smart, and, Charles, Willson, Peale, John, Smart, at, Philip, Mould , Most, collectors, of, miniature, portraits, will, have, an, opinion, on, who, was, the, best, artist,, with, many, agreeing, that, the, best, British, artist, was, John, Smart., There, is, currently, a, brief, opportunity, to, view, and/or, buy, from, a, selection, of, fine, works, by, him, collected, over, many, years., An, opportunity, to, view, a, collection, like, this,, especially, all, with, the, items, being, available, for, sale,, is, unlikely, to, be, repeated, in, the, foreseeable, future., As, has, been, mentioned, in, the, print, media,, see, press, or , http://online.flipbuilder.com/lawrence/nncx/, an, exhibition, ‘John, Smart:, A, Genius, Magnified’, arranged, by, Emma, Rutherford, and, Philip,

exhibition, showcases, forty-five, portrait, miniatures, and, drawings, from, a, single-owner, collection, and, represents, the, biggest, collection, of, miniatures, by, Smart, to, be, offered, on, the, open, market, for, almost, a, century., An, online, version, of, the, catalogue, (without, essays), can, be, viewed, by, clicking, here., A, price, list, can, be, viewed, here,, although, it, is, highly, recommended, you, get, in, touch, with, Emma, promptly, as, she, has, been, overwhelmed, by, the, amount, of, interest, so, far., To, order, a hard, copy, of, the, catalogue, to, be, sent, via, post,, please, email, by, clicking, here., In, its, nature, the, collection, is, just, as, important, as, other, major, collections,, such, as, the, collection, of, Smart's, work, in, the, Edward, B, Greene, Collection, at, the, Cleveland, Museum, of, Art., Even, more, impressive, is, the, Starr, Collection, of, Miniatures, in, Kansas, City,, where, there, is, a, collection, of, John, Smart, miniature, portraits, which, includes, dated, examples, for, every, year, from, 1760-1810., There, are, printed, catalogues, for, both, these, collections,, which, were, published, in, 1951, and, 1971,, and, which, occasionally, can, be, purchased, via, Abebooks, for, those, interested., Regular, visitors, to, this, site,, will, be, aware, that, earlier, this, year, the, single, miniature, portrait, below, on, paper, of, General, Thomas, Bruce, by, John, Smart, was, purchased, for, this, Artists, and, Ancestors, collection., http://british-miniatures.blogspot.co.nz/2014/09/smart-john-portrait-of-general-thomas.html, That, was, a, highlight, for, this, collector,, as, neither, the, vendor,, nor, the, other, bidders, at, the, auction,, realised, the, miniature, was, by, John, Smart., American, collectors, will, have, their, own, opinions, about, the, best, artist, who, worked, in, America., To, perhaps, help, enable, a, comparison, of, John, Smart, and, Charles, Willson, Peale,, this, collector, was, then, fortunate, enough, to, purchase, at, an, on-line, eBay, auction, a, miniature, portrait, by, Charles, Willson, Peale., http://aminports3.blogspot.com/2014/09/peale-charles-willson-portrait-of.html, Again, the, vendor, did, not, realise, who, the, artist, was,, but, this, time, another, bidder, did, realise, that, Peale, was, the, artist,, so, there, was, some, competition,, although, it, was, still, able, to, be, acquired, for, this, collection, at, well, below, the, normal, market, value., Its, condition, is, a, little, less, than, perfect,, but, at, an, age, of, 250, years, that, is, perhaps, to, be, expected., The, two, miniature, portraits, by, Peale, and, Smart, as, depicted, here,, were, acquired, within, two, months, of, each, other,, and, were, offered, for, auction, by, vendors, who, did, not, know, what, they, were, selling., That, is, the, best, possible, recommendation, for, collectors, to, study, miniatures, sufficiently, well, to, be, able, to, back, their, instincts, when, an, unattributed, work, comes, onto, the, market., Although, on, a, minor, (miniature!), scale,, the, personal, thrill, of, making, a, successful, purchase, and, attribution, against, expert, international, competition,, is, considerable, and,, even, without, the, same, degree, of, $$$, or, £££, signs,, is, perhaps, comparable, to, the, reaction, of, those, owners, of, major, works, who, receive, a, "thumbs, up", from, Philip, Mould, when, subjected, to, his, Fake, or, Fortune,
