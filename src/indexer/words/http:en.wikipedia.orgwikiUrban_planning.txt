[Urban, planning, From, Wikipedia,, the, free, encyclopedia, Jump, to:, navigation,, search, Urban, planning, designs, settlements,, from, the, smallest, towns, to, the, largest, cities., Shown, here, is, Hong, Kong, from, Western, District, overlooking, Kowloon,, across, Victoria, Harbour., Partizánske, in, Slovakia, –, an, example, of, a, typical, planned, European, industrial, city, founded, in, 1938, together, with, a, shoemaking, factory, in, which, practically, all, adult, inhabitants, of, the, city, were, employed., Urban, planning, is, a, technical, and, political, process, concerned, with, the, development, and, use, of, land,, planning, permission,, protection, and, use, of, the, environment,, public, welfare,, and, the, design, of, the, urban, environment,, including, air,, water,, and, the, infrastructure, passing, into, and, out, of, urban, areas,, such, as, transportation,, communications,, and, distribution, networks.[1], Urban, planning, is, also, referred, to, as, urban, and, regional, planning,, regional, planning,, town, planning,, city, planning,, rural, planning, or, some, combination, in, various, areas, worldwide., It, takes, many, forms, and, it, can, share, perspectives, and, practices, with, urban, design.[2], Urban, planning, guides, orderly, development, in, urban,, suburban, and, rural, areas., Although, predominantly, concerned, with, the, planning, of, settlements, and, communities,, urban, planning, is, also, responsible, for, the, planning, and, development, of, water, use, and, resources,, rural, and, agricultural, land,, parks, and, conserving, areas, of, natural, environmental, significance., Practitioners, of, urban, planning, are, concerned, with, research, and, analysis,, strategic, thinking,, architecture,, urban, design,, public, consultation,, policy, recommendations,, implementation, and, management.[3], Urban, planners, work, with, the, cognate, fields, of, architecture,, landscape, architecture,, civil, engineering,, and, public, administration, to, achieve, strategic,, policy, and, sustainability, goals., Early, urban, planners, were, often, members, of, these, cognate, fields., Today, urban, planning, is, a, separate,, independent, professional, discipline., The, discipline, is, the, broader, category, that, includes, different, sub-fields, such, as, land-use, planning,, zoning,, economic, development,, environmental, planning,, and, transportation, planning.[4], Contents, 1, History, 2, Theories, 3, Technical, aspects, 4, Urban, planners, 5, See, also, 6, References, 7, Further, reading, 8, External, links, History[edit], Further, information:, History, of, urban, planning, There, is, evidence, of, urban, planning, and, designed, communities, dating, back, to, the, Mesopotamian,, Indus, Valley,, Minoan,, and, Egyptian, civilizations, in, the, third, millennium, BCE., Archeologists, studying, the, ruins, of, cities, in, these, areas, find, paved, streets, that, were, laid, out, at, right, angles, in, a, grid, pattern.[5], The, idea, of, a, planned, out, urban, area, evolved, as, different, civilizations, adopted, it., Beginning, in, the, 8th, century, BCE,, Greek, city, states, were, primarily, centered, on, orthogonal, (or, grid-like), plans.[6], The, ancient, Romans,, inspired, by, the, Greeks,, also, used, orthogonal, plans, for, their, cities., City, planning, in, the, Roman, world, was, developed, for, military, defense, and, public, convenience., The, spread, of, the, Roman, Empire, subsequently, spread, the, ideas, of, urban, planning., As, the, Roman, Empire, declined,, these, ideas, slowly, disappeared., However,, many, cities, in, Europe, still, held, onto, the, planned, Roman, city, center., Cities, in, Europe, from, the, 9th, to, 14th, centuries,, often, grew, organically, and, sometimes, chaotically., But, many, hundreds, of, new, towns, were, newly, built, according, to, preconceived, plans,, and, many, others, were, enlarged, with, newly, planned, extensions., Most, of, these, were, realized, from, the, 12th, to, 14th, centuries,, with, a, peak-period, at, the, end, of, the, 13th.[7], From, the, 15th, century, on,, much, more, is, recorded, of, urban, design, and, the, people, that, were, involved., In, this, period,, theoretical, treatises, on, architecture, and, urban, planning, start, to, appear, in, which, theoretical, questions, are, addressed, and, designs, of, towns, and, cities, are, described, and, depicted., During, the, Enlightenment, period,, several, European, rulers, ambitiously, attempted, to, redesign, capital, cities., During, the, Second, French, Republic,, Baron, Georges-Eugène, Haussmann,, under, the, direction, of, Napoleon, III,, redesigned, the, city, of, Paris, into, a, more, modern, capital,, with, long,, straight,, wide, boulevards.[8], Planning, and, architecture, went, through, a, paradigm, shift, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century., The, industrialized, cities, of, the, 19th, century, grew, at, a, tremendous, rate., The, pace, and, style, of, this, industrial, construction, was, largely, dictated, by, the, concerns, of, private, business., The, evils, of, urban, life, for, the, working, poor, were, becoming, increasingly, evident, as, a, matter, for, public, concern., The, laissez-faire, style, of, government, management, of, the, economy,, in, fashion, for, most, of, the, Victorian, era,, was, starting, to, give, way, to, a, New, Liberalism, that, championed, intervention, on, the, part, of, the, poor, and, disadvantaged., Around, 1900,, theorists, began, developing, urban, planning, models, to, mitigate, the, consequences, of, the, industrial, age,, by, providing, citizens,, especially, factory, workers,, with, healthier, environments., Urban, planning, started, to, become, professionalized, during, this, time., The, Town, and, Country, Planning, Association, was, founded, in, 1899, and, the, first, academic, course, in, Great, Britain, on, urban, planning, was, offered, by, the, University, of, Liverpool, in, 1909.[9], In, the, 1920s,, the, ideas, of, modernism, and, uniformity, began, to, surface, in, urban, planning,, and, lasted, until, the, 1970s., Many, planners, started, to, believe, that, the, ideas, of, modernism, in, urban, planning, led, to, higher, crime, rates, and, social, problems.[10], Urban, planners, now, focus, more, on, individualism, and, diversity, in, urban, centers., Theories[edit], Further, information:, Theories, of, urban, planning, Planning, theory, is, the, body, of, scientific, concepts,, definitions,, behavioral, relationships,, and, assumptions, that, define, the, body, of, knowledge, of, urban, planning., There, are, eight, procedural, theories, of, planning, that, remain, the, principal, theories, of, planning, procedure, today:, the, rational-comprehensive, approach,, the, incremental, approach,, the, transactive, approach,, the, communicative, approach,, the, advocacy, approach,, the, equity, approach,, the, radical, approach,, and, the, humanist, or, phenomenological, approach.[11], Technical, aspects[edit], Further, information:, Technical, aspects, of, urban, planning, Technical, aspects, of, urban, planning, involve, the, applying, scientific,, technical, processes,, considerations, and, features, that, are, involved, in, planning, for, land, use,, urban, design,, natural, resources,, transportation,, and, infrastructure., Urban, planning, includes, techniques, such, as:, predicting, population, growth,, zoning,, geographic, mapping, and, analysis,, analyzing, park, space,, surveying, the, water, supply,, identifying, transportation, patterns,, recognizing, food, supply, demands,, allocating, healthcare, and, social, services,, and, analyzing, the, impact, of, land, use., Urban, planners[edit], Further, information:, Urban, planner, An, urban, planner, is, a, professional, who, works, in, the, field, of, urban, planning, for, the, purpose, of, optimizing, the, effectiveness, of, a, community's, land, use, and, infrastructure., They, formulate, plans, for, the, development, and, management, of, urban, and, suburban, areas,, typically, analyzing, land, use, compatibility, as, well, as, economic,, environmental, and, social, trends., In, developing, the, plan, for, a, community, (whether, commercial,, residential,, agricultural,, natural, or, recreational),, urban, planners, must, also, consider, a, wide, array, of, issues, such, as, sustainability,, air, pollution,, traffic, congestion,, crime,, land, values,, legislation, and, zoning, codes., The, importance, of, the, urban, planner, is, increasing, throughout, the, 21st, century,, as, modern, society, begins, to, face, issues, of, increased, population, growth,, climate, change, and, unsustainable, development., An, urban, planner, could, be, considered, a, green, collar, professional.[clarification, needed], See,
