Fists is, Wu-Tang, Clan, rapper-turned-actor/director, RZA’s, love, letter, to, the, martial, arts, movies, –, but, he’s, not, the, only, hardcore, fan, of, the, genre, out, there., Martial, arts, films, were, a, bridge, between, different, cultures, long, before, international, cinema, gained, the, sort, of, foothold, it, has, today, in, the, U.S.,, and, there, are, plenty, of, people, who, can, claim, a, kick-ass, fight, scene, as, an, indelible, part, of, their, memory., In, honor, of, all, that Man, with, the, Iron, Fists celebrates,, we’ve, gone, back, through, the, archives, to, pick, out, 12, martial, arts, movie, fight, sequences, that, earned, a, place, in, our, hearts, –, whether, it, was, the, impressive, fight, choreography,, the, sheer, scale, of, the, battle,, or, simply, because, it, featured, some, iconic, martial, arts, stars, throwing, down, against, one, another., Check, out, 12, great, martial, arts, movie, fights, (listed, in, no, particular, order):, –, Neo, vs., Agent, Smith, (The, Matrix), Admittedly,, it’s, hard, to, find, a, Hollywood, film, that, can, match, the, level, of, fight choreography, being, put, out, by, the, Asian, film, industry, –, but, The, Matrix, was, definitely, one, of, the, them, –, thanks, in, no, small, part, to, the, influence, of, legendary, fight, choreographer/director, Woo-ping, Yuen,, whose, work, appears, numerous, times, in, this, list., Aside, from, actors, like, Keanu, Reeves, and, Hugo, Weaving, impressing, us, with, their, level, of, martial, arts, ability, –, and, some, clever, little, touches, to, the, choreography, (throat, jab, FTW!), – the, climatic, battle, between, hacker-turned-hero,, Neo, (Reeves), and, the, nefarious, program, Agent, Smith, (Weaving), included something, that, only, the, best, cinematic, duels, do:, great, dialogue, and, character, development., Hearing, “Mr., Anderson”, utter, the, line, “My, name…, is, NEO!”, before, putting, the, finishing, touches, on, that, Agent, Smith, beatdown, was, at, once, a, pivotal, moment, for, our, hero,, and, a, kick-ass, finale, to, a, great, fight., –, The, Bride, vs., The, Crazy, 88, (Kill, Bill, Vol., 1), While, there, have, been, some, truly, legendary, one-on-one, fights, in, movies,, it’s, a, whole, other, ballgame, when, one, person, takes, on, an, entire, multitude, of, enemies., In, his, own, love-letter, to, the, martial, arts, movie, genre,, Kill, Bill,, writer/director, Quentin, Taratino concocted and, executed, (no, pun), a, fight, sequence, that, stands, toe-to-toe, with, the, very, films, that, inspired, it., All, things, being, honest,, few, people, ever, imagined, that, actress, Uma, Thurman, could, be, taken, seriously, as, an, action, star, –, let, alone, a, martial, arts, action, star., However,, that, all, changed, when, Thurman, (as, the, vengeance-seeking, “Bride”), drew, a, katana, sword, and, took, on, no, less, than, eighty-eight, members, of, O-Ren, Ishii’s, (Lucy, Liu), Yakuza, army, –, including, psycho, teenage, bodyguard,, Gogo, (Chiaki, Kuriyama). Check, out, this, epic, battle, to, the, last, (wo)man, standing:, –, Tang, Lung, vs., Colt, (The Way, of, the, Dragon), There, are, martial, arts, fight, scenes, that, earn, their, reputation, through, sophisticated, choreography, –, and, then, there, are, those, that, are, remembered, for, their, iconic, nature., Even, now,, forty, years, later,, it, is, still, awesome, to, see, Bruce, Lee, battling, Chuck, Norris, in Way, of, the, Dragon., Tang, Lung, (Lee), is, trying, to, defend, family, and, friends, from, a, local, Roman, mafia, –, but, when, he, proves, to, be, an, obstacle,, mob, lieutenant, “Ho”, hires, foreign, martial, artists, to, solve, the, problem, –, including, fearsome, karate, fighter,, Colt, (Norris)., Like, gladiators, of, old,, Tang, and, Colt, have, their, epic, showdown, in, the, halls, of, the, Colosseum, –, and, for, awhile, Colt, holds, the, upper, hand., But, Bruce, Lee, is, Bruce, Lee,, so, losing, was, never, really, an, option., Even, though, the, telegraphed, punches, and, kicks, seem, dated, by, today’s, standards,, the, awesomeness, of, seeing, one, of, the, greatest, martial, artists, of, all, time, battle, one, of, the, most, badass, action, stars, of, all, time, never, fades., Plus:, there’s, a, kitty-cat, referee!, –, Lu, Yan, vs., The, Silent, Monk, (The, Forbidden, Kingdom), There, isn’t, much, we, love, about The, Forbidden, Kingdom, –, a, fluffy, marital, arts, adventure, film, made, by, the, guy, who, directed The, Lion, King –, but, it does contain, a, pretty, epic, showdown, between, two, martial, arts, movie, legends:, Jet, Li, and, Jackie, Chan., Both, men, were, not, exactly, spring, chickens, when, the, movie, was, released, in, 2008, (Li, was, 45,, Chan, 54),, but, all, things, considered,, they, put, on, quite, a, show., When, Drunken, immortal, Lu, Yan, (Chan), enters, the, temple, of, the, silent, monk, (Li),, the, two, have, a, “misunderstanding”, in, the, form, of, a, martial, arts, brawl., While, the, choreography is, a, little, silly, (what, with, all, the, “wire-fu”, aerial, antics),, the, significance, of, seeing, these, two, icons, share, the, screen, more, than, makes, up, for, it., –, Tien, vs., Imperial, Guard, (Ong, Bak, 3), Tony, Jaa, became, a, breakout, marital, arts, movie, star, thanks, to Ong, Bak,, and, there, are, certainly, plenty, of, scenes, from, the, franchise, that, would, easily, qualify, for, this, list., However,, Ong, Bak, 3, features, the, Muay, Thai, fighter, in, one, especially, crazy, scene,, taking, on, the, soldiers, of, evil, Lord, Rajasena., What, is, so, crazy, about, this, particular, sequence,, you, ask?, Well,, for, one, it, features, Tien, (Jaa), looking, feral, enough, to, be, Blanka, from Street, Fighter;, it, also, features, Tien, taking, on, a, multitude, of, opponents, at, once., But, if, all, that, wasn’t, enough,, this, particular, fight, sequence, incorporates, actual, elephants, into, the, complex, choreography, –, yep,, you, read, that, correctly:, ELEPHANTS., –, Ip, Man, vs., General, Miura, (Ip, Man), The, movie Ip, Man –, based, on, real-life, Wing, Chun, martial, arts, master, Yip, Man, –, is, as, much, about, the, history, of, southern, China, as, it, is, the, titular, character., This, is, why, scenes, of, actual, martial, arts, combat, in, the, film, hold, such, weight:, they’re, not, just, battles, between, men,, they, symbolize, the, ups, and, downs, of, China’s, struggle, against, the, Japanese, invasion, of, the, 1930s., Martial, arts, movie, star, Donnie, Yen, plays, Ip, as, the, quiet,, humble,, and, carefully, measured, man, he, was;, however,, when, Ip, is, finally, forced, to, display, his, Wing, Chun, martial, arts, against, the, heartless, General, Miura’s, (Hiroyuki, Ikeuchi), karate, assault,, he, unleashes, the, punishing, wrath, of, not, just, Wing, Chun,, but, all, of, China., In, the, end,, ever, the, disciplined, master,, Ip, Man, spares, his, enemy, and, shows, mercy, –, which, is, more, than, his, enemy, would, ever, do, for, him., –, Chen, Zhen, vs., General, Fujita, (Fist, of, Legend), The, character, of, Chen, Zhen, has, appeared, in, numerous, marital, arts, films, and, TV, series,, and, has, been, played, by, famous, martial, artists, that, include, Bruce, Lee, and, Donnie, Yen., Jet, Li, stepped, into, the, role, of, Chen, for, the, 1994, film Fist, of, Legend,, and, his, showdown, with, World, Kickboxing, champion-turned-actor, Billy, Chow, (as, “Supreme, Killer”, General, Fujita), remains, the, stuff, of, martial, arts, movie…, er,, legend., In, the, hands, of, a, master,, belt, beats, sword, every, time:, –, Iron, Monkeys, vs., Governor, Hin-Hung, (Iron, Monkey), Fight, choreographer/director, Woo-ping, Yuen, gained, fame, with, American, audiences, thanks, to, the, release, of The, Matrix in, 1999,, but, he, had, been, making, kick-ass, marital, arts, films, long, before, that, –, including, the, 1993, film,, Iron, Monkey., A, sort, of, twist, on, the, Robin, Hood, tale,, Iron, Monkey follows, benevolent, doctor, Yang, Tianchun, (Yu, Rongguang), who, moonlights, as, “Iron, Monkey,”, a, masked, hero, who, steals, from, the, rich, and, gives, to, the, poor., The, twist, comes, when, another, physician, named, Wong, Kei-ying (Donnie, Yen), moves, to, town, with, his, young, son;, when, corrupt, local, officials, notice, Wong’s, marital, arts, prowess,, they, mistake, him, for, being, Iron, Monkey, and, exact, revenge., The, finale, of, the, film, sees, the, two, doctors, teaming, up, to, save, Wong’s, son, from, Shaolin, warrior-turned-corrupt, Governor, Hin-Hung, (Yen, Shi-Kwan),, in, a, battle, that, takes, place, on, wooden, poles, over, a, fire, pit., The, scene, remains,, to, this, day,, one, of, the, greatest, “wire-fu”, fight, sequences, ever, put, to, film., ?, –, Rama, &, Andi, vs., Mad, Dog, (The, Raid:, Redemption),  The, Raid:, Redemption was, one, of, the, best, action, films, of, 2011, –, arguably, one, of, the, best, action, films, in, years., The, film, –, about, a, squad, of, cops, stuck, in, an, apartment, complex, filled, with, criminals, –, catapulted, Welsh, director, Gareth, Evans, to, stardom,, while, putting, a, spotlight, on, the, Indonesian, martial, arts, style, pencak, silat., Fight, choreographers, Iko, Uwais, and, Yaya, Ruhian, play, super, cop, Rama, and, super, villain, Mad, Dog,, respectively., In, the, film’s, climatic, battle,, Rama, tries, to, save, his, criminal, mastermind, brother, Andi, (Donni, Alamsyah), from, the, wrath, of, Mad, Dog., What, ensues, is, one, of, the, most brutal martial, arts, battles, we’ve, ever, seen., Check, out, what, it, takes, to, put, a, Mad, Dog, down:, –, Wong, Fei-hung, vs., Axe, Gang, (The, Legend, of, Drunken, Master), Before, The, Bride, battled, the, Crazy, 88, in Kill, Bill or, Rama, took, on, the, nightmarish, machete, gang, in The, Raid:, Redemption,, Jackie, Chan, was, battling, a, horde, of, ax-wielding thugs, while, managing, to, make, us, laugh, at, the, same, time., Legend, of, Drunken, Master, is, the, 1994, sequel, to, the, 1978, classic, Drunken, Master,, which, helped, launch, the, international, stardom, of, both, Jackie, Chan, and, Woo-ping, Yuen., Woo-ping, didn’t, return, to, direct, the, sequel,, but, Legend, of, Drunken, Master, nontheless offers, a, sense, of, both, fun, and, skill, in, its, fight, choreography., Stop, for, a, second, and, consider, just, how, difficult, these, stunts, were, –, executed, in, the, name, of, comedy,, as, much, as, action:, –, Inspector, Ma, Kwun, vs., Jack, (Killzone, –, S.P.L.), I, must, confess, Killzone (a.k.a., Saat, po, lang), is, the, one, film, on, this, list, I haven’t seen, –, but, I, will, be, seeing, it, now,, for, sure., And, this, clip, is, the, reason, why., Donnie, Yen, is, a, martial, arts, star, that, belongs, up, there, with, Bruce, Lee,, Jet, Li,, Jackie, Chan,, etc., –, though, it, somehow, feels, like, he, doesn’t, get, the, recognition, he, deserves, with, international, audiences., In, any, event, Killzone is, a, convoluted, tale, about, where, the, moral, line, lies, in, the, fight, between, cops, and, crooks, –, but, one, thing, that, is, easy, to, understand, is, when, Inspector, Ma, Kwun, (Yen), confronts Jack, (Jing, Wu),, the, knife-wielding, assassin, who, killed, the, men, of, Kwun’s, unit:, –, Yu, Shu, Lien, vs., Jen, Yu, (Crouching, Tiger,, Hidden, Dragon), With, the, exception, of Kill, Bill,, pretty, much, every, entry, on, this, list, has, been, about, male, martial, arts, stars, –, but, ladies, can, be, just, as, formidable, as, guys., Ang, Lee’s, martial, arts, drama Crouching, Tiger,, Hidden, Dragon turned, martial, arts, films, into, Oscar-wining, cinematic, art,, and, the, performances, of, its, stars, –, Chow, Yun-Fat,, Michelle, Yeoh, and, Ziyi, Zhang, –, were, a, major, contributing, factor., Spoiled, rich, girl, Jen, Yu’s, (Zhang), immaturity, brings, chaos, to, the, lives, of, aging, martial, arts, warriors, Li, Mu, Bai, (Yun-Fat), and, Yu, Shu, Lien, (Yeoh), –, an unrequited pair, who, were, trying, to, leave, the, life, of, the, sword, behind,, so, that, they, might, settle, down, together., Despite, the, warriors’, great, patience,, Jen, pushes, a, delicate, situation, to, dire, straits,, and, Yu, Shu, Lien, is, the, one, who, steps, up, to, put, the, young, girl, in, her, place, –, by, way, of, a, kick-ass, duel., Using, just, about, every, weapon, in, a, warrior’s, dojo, against, the, might, of, “Green, Destiny”, –, the, legendary, sword, Jen, stole, from, Li, Mu, Bai, –, Yu, Shu, Lien, helps, brash, Jen, separate, the, fantasy, of, being, a, warrior, from, the, harsh, reality:, –, NEXT, PAGE:, HONORABLE, MENTIONS…, –, Honorable, Mentions, Listen,, we, can’t, list every great, martial, arts, fight, scene, known, to, man, –, and, I’m, sure, there, are, a, few, of, your, favorites, that, were, left, out, of, our, list., But, because, we, love, the, genere, so, much,, here, are, just, a, few, of, the, scenes, we, mulled, over,, but, ultimately, had, to, pass, on,, for, various, reasons., (I, mean, honestly,, this, whole, thing, could’ve, been, Tony, Jaa, fight, scenes…), Tony, Jaa, in The, Protector , This, movie, has, many, highlights,, but, a, one-take, tracking, shot, and, bone-crunching, fight, sequence, top, the, list., –, Hallway, Fight, in Oldboy, This, doesn’t, really, qualify, as, “martial, arts”, –, more, like, ‘epic, brawl’, –, but, it’s, awesome,, nonetheless,, so, we, had, to, give, it, a, shout, out., –, Final, Showdown, in Five, Deadly, Venoms, How, could, we, leave, out, this, Shaw, Brothers, classic,, which, inspired, RZA’s, Wu-Tang, Clan, persona?, Answer:, We, couldn’t., –, Bruce, Lee, vs., Japanese, School, in, The Chinese, Connection, It, wouldn’t, be, right, to, end, a, post, like, this, with, anything, else, BUT a, famous, Bruce, Lee, scene., –, Check, out, more, marital, arts, action, in The, Man, with, the, Iron, Fists,, when, it, hits,
