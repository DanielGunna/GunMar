the, end, of, 2017., In, the, meantime, clues, to, what, is, intended, are, to, be, found, in, Taylor’s, Preliminary, Remarks., The, book’s, title, may, well, be, CONSCIOUS, MATTER.,  , BEING, CONSCIOUS,  , Preliminary, Remarks,  ,  , As, I, begin, writing, this, book, I, am, reading, Ahmad, Fāris, al-Shidyāq., His, Leg, Over, Leg., Its, mode, of, construction,, or, its, way, of, growth,, I, am, inclined, to, adopt, for, the, composition, of, this, book., Perhaps, ‘composition’, is, too, strong, a, word., Perhaps, the, concept, of, ‘serendipitous, making’, would, fit, better,, although, Walpole’s, arrogant, discarding, of, Thomas, Chatterton, is, an, unfortunate, association., I, am, thinking, here, not, so, much, of, my, admiration, of, al, Shidyāq,, and, not, at, all, of, the, attractions, of, parody,, but, rather, of, my, subject, matter., The, life, of, consciousness, is, not, systematic, in, anyway,, or,, at, least,, this, I, will, argue., Systematic, focus, is, simply, a, tool, of, consciousness., If, my, book, follows, al-Shidyāq, (or, for, that, matter, to, compare, with, more, familiar, or, more, local, territory,, Laurence, Sterne), it, will, be, more, like, actual, minds:, conscious,, desiring,, feeling,, sensing,, thinking, etc.,, but, always, a, fusion, of, them, all, and, always, moving, through, time, and, space, (, before,, now, and, after,, here, and, there)., In, this, way, it, may, catch, its, subject, or, resemble, it.,  , But, is, consciousness, a, problem, to, be, addressed?, Or, can, the, subject, be, taken, for, granted, and, there’s, an, end, to, it?, For, most, people, it, can, be, left, unaddressed,, that’s, for, sure., I, have, said, to, several, that, I, have, before, me, an, immense, labour,, which, is, a, work, about, consciousness., Never, have, I, been, asked, why, I, am, bothering, with, this,, especially, at, my, age., No, one, has, confided, to, me, that, they, are, troubled, by, the, topic, and, that, my, setting, about, the, task, is, for, them, thereby, of, interest., Of, course, I, know, the, consensus, would, be, different, confronted, by, a, philosophic, and/or, scientific, community, (e.g., Henry, Marsh,, eminent, neurosurgeon,, on, BBC’s, Artsnight, programme, 04.03.16,, said, ‘Being, our, own, consciousness, is, a, greater, mystery, than, the, Big, Bang, and, the, cosmos’), rather, than, my, usual,, limited, range, of, acquaintances., And, I, must, say, I, am, a, little, perplexed, myself, to, find, I, am, committing, to, such, an, undertaking., When, I, finished, what, is, currently, my, penultimate, book, I, was, of, the, firm, conviction, that, it, would, be, possible, to, retire, from, the, theoretical, life., This, firmness, soon, dissolved., For, one, thing, I, had, forgotten, my, inability, to, leave, loose, ends, untied., There, were, several, threads, left, behind, from, previous, efforts, which, I, saw, a, way, of, tidying, by, being, able, to, combine, them, into, a, novella, extolling, the, evolutionary, advantages, of, being, unnoticed., So, Invisible, Cells, &, Vanishing, Masses, was, followed, by, Thérèse, &, Tiamat., At, the, same, time, I, kept, returning, to, the, penultimate, book,, partly, because, of, my, interest, in, promoting, it,, but, also, because, one, of, its, longest, parts, (which, in, the, context, of, the, parts, of, that, book, is, known, as, a, cell,, and, the, cell, in, particular, known, as, Escape,, Block, 2, Cell, 6,, and, probably, much, too, long, for, any, considerations, appertaining, to, the, aesthetic, balance, of, the, book, as, a, whole), was,, for, some, of, the, subject, matter, intrinsic, to, it,, insufficiently, tightly, woven,, its, pattern, not, fully, established, or, knotted, off,, so, not, long, enough, in, fact,, but, how, long, is, a, piece, of, theory?, More, loose, ends, then.,  , But, before, I’ve, started, is, there, not, already, a, contradiction?, Is, this, not, like, my, playing, chess, against, my, chess-playing, machine,, Kasparov,, dramatizing, the, encounter, as, challenging, quite, legitimately, for, the, world, championship,, but, finding, after, a, few, moves,, the, computer, set, at, one, of, its, more, basic, levels,, that, I, am, already, trapped, and, defeated?, Well, not, quite!, The, mind,, and, as, this, is, only, the, outset, this, is, much, too, affirmative,, like, the, universe, itself,, like, any, of, its, parts,, is, a, simmering, cauldron,, subject, to, the, forces, of, chaos, and, order., Loose, ends, have, to, be, addressed, but, they, will, unravel., Revisiting, the, myth, of, Sisyphus, I, suppose,, although, it, was, a, long, time, ago, I, read, the, Camus.,  , However,, there, is, much, more, to, this, task, than, some, inner, compulsion, for, tidiness., Although, if, this, compulsion, is, a, disorder, of, the, mind, it, should, not, be, underestimated, as, I, do, find, myself,, wherever, I, am,, constantly, straightening, reality,, i.e., aligning, cutlery,, nudging, mats,, adjusting, picture, frames,, etc:, the, attempt, to, impose, order,, something, I, do, not, really, believe, in., The, ‘much, more’, springs, from, a, feeling, of, loathing, towards, a, prevailing, climate, within, science, and, philosophy,, and, more, than, anything, it, is, this, which, has, disturbed, the, repose, I, sought, from, a, proposed, retirement, dedicated, only, to, the, making, and, attempted, ordering, of, marks, on, paper,, canvas, and, digitally, sensitive, surfaces, (drawing,, painting, and, tablet, virtuality)., What, then, provokes, this, loathing?,  , The, matter, is, complicated., To, begin, with, I, am, not, any, kind, of, immaterialist,, nor, do, I, think, that, understanding, reality, requires, any, abandoning, of, ordinary,, philosophical, logic., I, cannot, say, how, in, introduction, I, am, best, described, (this, will, become, clearer, later), but, with, these, disavowals, I, am, saying, that, what, ordinarily, would, be, taken, to, be, positions, hostile, to, science, and, philosophy, I, oppose, too., Perhaps, what, I, am, about, approximates, to, reinstating, naive, or, direct, realism,, and, as, a, result, countering, the, seduction, of, what, in, science, and, philosophy, is, smart, but, careless, thinking, and, insensitive, understanding, (the, kind, of, thinking, which, leads, science,, paradoxically,, to, metaphysics).,  , However, by, way, of, introduction, let, me, approach, the, matter, very,, very, simply., There, is, a, standard, format, adopted, by, film, and, programme-makers, when, attempting, to, educate, or, introduce, the, public, about, or, to, scientific, topics., They, start, with, some, very, general,, theoretical, patter, (leaning, over, backwards, to, make, learning, fun, and, not, alienating),, presented, by, a, mix, of, programme, professionals, and, scientists, active, in, the, field,, to, be, followed, by, what, might, be, mistaken, for, hieroglyphic, text, but, which, is, in, fact, a, string, of, mathematical, equations., It, is, clear, that, most, of, the, audience, will, be, at, a, total, loss, with, this, discourse., The, text, used, is, presented, as, proof,, therefore, as, something, which, is, true., And,, of, course, this, will, be, so, unless, the, mathematical, subject, is, contentious., Typically, in, such, films, and, programmes, the, equations, appear, on, blackboards,, the, chalk, marks, tracing, a, haste, driven, by, creative, frenzy., Somehow, this, heightens, the, emotive, significance, of, proofs, putting, them, on, a, par, with, the, ‘spirituality’, of, art,, e.g., iconic, paintings, by, Jackson, Pollock, or, Francis, Bacon!, The, seeming, hieroglyph, then, undergoes, a, seeming, deciphering, or, translation., There, is, a, movement, from, propositions, in, mathematics, to, propositions, about, reality., But, how, is, this?, Is, there, not, something, problematic, about, the, move, from, mathematical, knowledge, to, ordinary, language,, and, why, should, it, be, thought, that, professional, scientists, are, proficient, at, this, kind, of, translation., In, fact, why, should, it, be, presupposed, that, such, translations, are, possible?, Numbers, are, not, hieroglyphs., So, I, might, chalk, up, on, a, blackboard, 2x, +, 2x, =, 4x, and, then, quickly, cut, to, a, sequence, of, meta-mathematical, equations, (Russellian, fundamentals), and, claim, these, to, be, the, ultimate, mathematical, proof, of, the, primary, equation, so, that, 2x, +, 2x, =, 4x, is, proven, both, universally, and, necessarily, true., I, might, then, add, to, this,, reverting, to, ordinary, discourse,, that, maths, therefore, proves, that, two, of, anything, added, to, two, of, anything, will, give, four, things,, whatever, those, things, are., Prima, facie, this, assertion,, now, an, assertion, about, reality,, might, seem, unobjectionable., Mathematics, then, tells, us, about, the, structure, of, reality,, in, this, simple, case, and, presumably, in, much, more, complex, cases., But, this, is, not, so, straightforward., That, +, is, equivalent, to, ‘added, to’, and, that, x,, in, the, equation,, is, equivalent, to, ‘anything’ , and, =, is, equivalent, to, ‘gives’, is, to, fail, to, identify, +,, x , and, =, (in, the, equation), as, the, specific, mathematical, instruments, that, they, are., Thus, two, reds, added, to, two, reds, (in, paint), do, not, give, four, reds,, any, more, than, two, drops, of, water, added, to, two, drops, of, water, give, four, drops, of, water,, anymore, than, two, vols, of, gas, added, to, two, vols, of, gas, give, four, vols, of, gas,, anymore, than, two, noises, added, to, two, noises, (say, cheering, at, a, football, match), give, four, noises., Back, in, the, real, world, the, whole, is, often, more, than, the, sum, of, its, parts, or, different, from, the, sum, of, its, parts.,  , Again, by, way, of, introduction, and, so, very, simply, we, get, blackboard, hieroglyphics, followed, by, ordinary, language, claims, like, this, opens, up, the, possibility, or, makes, plausible, the, notion, of, parallel, universes, or, the, real, possibility, in, the, future, of, time, travel,, none, of, these, terms, being, technical., Professional, scientists,, mathematicians, say, things, like, this,, and, because, they, wave, the, mathematical, wand, they, are, believed., There, seems, to, be, no, notion, that, what, is, said, outside, the, seeming, hieroglyph, gives, rise, to, a, complex, range, of, conceptual, problems., All, of, this, is, bypassed, by, means, of, an, invitation, to, the, occult,, trying, to, seduce, ordinary, understanding, with, the, temptation, to, entertain, that, reality, is, much, stranger, than, common-sense, supposes., There, is, a, delight, on, the, scientist’s, face, as, the, absurdity, of, what, is, said, is, bounced, into, the, realm, of, truth, by, the, workings, of, proofs., But, even, at, this, early, stage, just, stop, to, consider., ‘Parallel, universes’, might, seem, to, make, sense, but, the, notion, of, the, universe, (the, aggregate, of, all, matter,, energy, and, space), is, the, notion, of, all, there, is, physically,, how, then, can, there, be, a, plurality, of, them,, surely, a, contradiction, in, terms?, Parallel, anyway, is, a, spatial, concept, so, how, can, there, be, a, space, parallel, to, all, of, space., There, is, nothing, unscientific, or, mystical, about, objecting, in, this, way,, it, is, rather, an, insistence, on, logic., The, absurdity, is, one, of, translation, from, apriori, proof, to, ontology., This, is, not, to, say, that, there, cannot, be, material, reality, beyond, the, observable, universe., Or, consider, the, notion, of, time, travel, which, has, become, almost, an, unquestioned, commonplace, in, popular, thinking, and, to, which, some, science, lends, credence,, a, credibility, based, on, equations, involving, space,, time,, mass, and, the, mathematical, complexities, of, relativity., There, is, little, reflection, on, the, logic, of, a, conceptual, structure, that, spans, then,, now, and, next,, or, being, before,, simultaneous, with, or, after., What, sense, can, be, attributed, to, saying, that, something, that, was, then, but, is, not, now, is, nonetheless, now, in, that, we, can, go, to, it, now,, so, that, it, is, then, but, now., Or,, impossible, though, it, is,, if, we, were, to, travel, to, x, that, was, then, but, is, not, now, (now), then, (in, an, entirely, different, sense), x, then, will, become, different, from, the, x, then, that, precedes, now,, but, if, x, then, was, preceded, by, w, at, some, other, then, and, someone, from, some, now, had, travelled, to, that, w, then, then, (in, that, entirely, different, sense), x, then, will, also, be, different, precluding, the, possibility, of, travel, to, x, then., The, whole, concept, is, conceptually, incoherent., The, matter, is, as, bad, if, travelling, in, the, opposite, ‘direction’., Though, metaphorical, we, do, speak, and, understandably, of, ‘travelling’, in, time, towards, the, future,, whereas,, certainly, as, a, matter, of, empirical, fact,, we, do, not, ‘travel’, backwards, in, time., However,, the, notion, of, time-travel, is, not, that, of, living, through, each, next, moment, to, arrive, quite, naturally, at, some, future, date, as, we, might, specify, it, starting, out,, i.e., knowing, that, now, is, Tuesday, and, that, next, will, be, Wednesday, and, living, through, Tuesday, until, what, is, then, now, is, Wednesday., What, time-travel, into, the, future, requires, is, that, what, is, now, is, what, will, be!, We, are, supposed, to, go, from, what, is, now, to, what, will, be, but, for, what, will, be, to, be, now,, but, the, way, of, getting, to, what, will, be, is, without, living, through, the, intervening, period, that, makes, sense, of, what, will, be, being, able, to, be, the, now, of, some, future., What, will, be, has, not, happened, and, so, cannot, exist, now., What, has, not, happened, does, not, exist., The, fiction, that, it, does, by-passes, critical, intelligence, by, means, of, a, willing, suspension, of, disbelief.,  , To, hasty, cognoscenti, these, objections, will, incur, derision, believing, as, they, will, that, the, sophistication, of, concepts, given, ordinary, language, names, like, time-warp, etc.,, have, not, even, been, scratched., Perhaps, these, concepts, are, much, more, sophisticated, than, rudimentary, skirmishes, can, allow, (certainly, the, concept, of, time, is, contentious, between, science, and, philosophy), but, the, trouble, is, that, rarely, do, such, discussions, begin., The, wand, is, waved, and, everyone, is, acquiescent., But, it, is, my, intention, to, inflict, much, more, damage, than, scratches, in, due, course., The, loathing, then, is, for, a, world, in, which, meritocratic, power, and, a, veneer, of, cleverness, conceals, shallow,, hasty, thinking,, if, not, ignorance,, and, yet, expects, deference., There, are, so, many, factors, that, are, a, part, of, this., The, cultural, divide, between, science, and, the, humanities, plays, its, part., Typically, it, is, said, that, scientists, do, not, write, well,, but, what, truth, there, is, in, this, is, not, a, trivial, truth, about, a, formal,, stylistic, difference,, rather, it, is, a, difference, of, substance,, a, difference, in, understanding, how, things, are,, a, difference, in, being, able, to, grasp, our, variable, chaos, of, things;, that, our, reality, is, mutable, (although, mathematics, supposes, it, accounts, for, this, in, the, abstractions, of, chaos, theory, but, on, examination, I, will, argue, this, is, just, a, case, in, point,, and, as, far, removed, from, the, real, as, similar, cases, like, games, theory, and, flumes, theory;, subjects, to, be, returned, to)., For, example,, assessing, whether, from, Turing’s, programming, equations, one, can, derive, truths, about, the, reality, of, thinking, and, consciousness, requires, a, sensitivity, to, and, conceptual, creativity, towards, the, ordinary., Turing, may, not, have, possessed, this,, as, Wittgenstein, may, have, had, to, point, out, to, him, in, their, talk, of, bridges, collapsing., I, am, not, prejudging, how, any, of, these, particular, issues, are, to, be, argued, out, (they, will, be, returned, to, in, detail)., I, am, merely, expressing, at, this, stage, how, appalling, I, think, it, is, that, so, much, complex, theory, which, gets, taken, seriously, is, generated, by, a, lack, of, initial, attention, to, or, understanding, of, basic, concepts,, and, how, as, a, result, the, whole, world, may, be, distorted, both, theoretically, and, practically,, just, as, medieval, religion,, despite, the, seemingly, logical, intricacy, of, its, theodicy,, warped, the, medieval, mind, and, its, social, reality, as, a, whole., The, possible, problems, in, science, are, compounded, by, the, undoubted, success, of, science, in, changing, the, world,, so, that, its, pronouncements, carry, undoubted,, meritocratic, authority., The, ubiquitous, dominance, of, artificial, intelligence,, information, technology, and, robotics, might, lead, one, to, suppose, that, the, theorist, pioneering, these, technological, changes, and, I, suppose, for, that, matter, their, philosophical, acolytes, are, in, the, best, position, to, take, on, the, so-called, (in, philosophy, and, then, influentially, echoed, by, Tom, Stoppard), ‘hard, problem’, of, consciousness., It, is, my, intention, to, challenge, this, presumption,, and, to, challenge, it, to, prevent, our, real, lives, being, stolen, from, us., What, should, be, realised, about, science, despite, all, it, has, contributed, to, the, unrealised, possibilities, of, an, easier, life, (and, in, the, end, this, is, the, net, value, of, science), is, that, scientists, themselves, for, the, most, part, do, not, disassociate, themselves, from, the, existing, economic, order,, and,, instead,, make, positive, contributions, to, its, progress, and, protection., The, systems, of, labour, employed, by, our, economic, order, are, highly, dependent, on, scientific, theory, leading, to, an, attempted, reification, of, social, life., If, the, drift, of, science, in, the, consciousness, debate, is, to, bring, the, centre, of, life, into, a, reified, system, then, a, radicalised, movement, is, required, to, build, a, realist, discourse, in, opposition, before, it, is, too, late,, allowing, us, confidently, and, so, without, apology, to, live, as, centres, of, anarchic, or, uncontrollable, freedom.,  , Scientists, often, pose, as, radical, wizards., Their, knowledge, is, proffered, as, a, sort, of, magical, enlightenment, for, ordinary, understanding, which, paradoxically, science, characterises, as, gripped, by, something, resembling, witchcraft, from, the, Dark, Ages, (Richard, Dawkins!)., The, spell, is, the, maths, and, a, grossly, insensitive, version, of, scientific, method,, the, wizardry, is, a, metaphysical, invasion, of, terrestrial, commonplaces,, backed, by, a, presupposition, that, everything, reduces, to, quantifiable,, measureable, matter., So, that,, for, example, the, solidity, of, the, real, world,, the, world, we, experience, dematerializes, into, an, underlying, reality, of, particles, and, charges,, measurements, of, energy, and, a, preponderance, of, empty, space,, seemingly, not, at, all, the, world, as, ordinary, understanding, experiences, it., The, enticing, smile, of, the, wizard, (like, Brian, Cox, on, the, telly), is, there, before, us, beckoning, us, to,, like, Alice,, abandon, the, mundane, for, the, rabbit-hole, and, Wonderland,, and,, of, course, Dodgson, too, was, a, mathematician, and, logician., But, it, is, a, misunderstanding, to, suppose, that, the, translation, from, one, mode, of, discourse, to, another, is, swapping, a, superior, for, an, inferior, language., Reality, is, as, both, these, languages, describe, it,, and, if, you, lack, the, language, of, solidity, and, materiality, your, grip, on, reality, is, that, of, a, Bowie, avatar,, weightless, and, abandoned, in, space., And,, of, course,, the, scientist’s, radical, posture, is, no, more, than, a, professional, elitism, and, certainly, not, a, radicalism, in, the, traditions, of, real, radicals, like, Rosa, Luxemburg., Scientists, are, careerists,, conformists,, upholders, of, the, status, quo, as, well, as, the, existing, system, of, class, differentiation., Science, is, not, being, used, to, dismantle, the, social, order,, instead, it, fully, cooperates, in, building, Huxley’s, Brave, New, Worlds., In, their, tactile, dealings, with, reality, scientists, are, indistinguishable, from, everyone, else, but, their, institutional, claim, to, knowledge, establishes, a, deference, towards, their, subject, and, so, to, towards, all, the, systems, it, supports., But, we, need, to, say, that, reality, is, (metaphorically), as, much, a, slab, of, solid, concrete, as, it, is, a, worm-infested, plank, of, wood, and, that, one, is, the, other, and, one, not, realer, than, the, other., Remembering, A.J., Ayer,, Mozart’s, Violin, Concerto, No.3, is, both, scientifically, measurable, vibrations, of, catgut, scratching, strings, and, a, sublime, passage, of, the, As, If, (a, concept, deeply, embedded, and, elaborated, in, my, theoretical, history).,  , So, these, are, some, of, the, grounds, of, loathing, on, which, this, path, to, correction, lies., And, what, is, at, issue, is, much, more, than, disputed, theory., The, reification, of, consciousness, is, not, simply, a, theoretical, claim, and, if, true, an, irresistible, reality,, but, an, assault, on, life, itself,, a, social, mechanisation,, a, pacification,, a, social, practice, and, part, of, something, much, larger., The, dominance, of, work,, the, dominance, of, time, and, motion, is, the, landscape, as, a, whole., It, permeates, everything., It, is, an, ethic,, it, is, social, movement,, life, is, for, it, not, it, for, life,, it, drives, the, time, and, space, in, which, we, exist,, nationals, and, migrants, alike,, it, is, the, form, of, every, slogan, in, political, exhortation,, it, is, the, medium, in, which, consciousness, struggles, not, to, suffocate., ‘Hard-working, people, who, do, the, right, thing’, are, not, thereby, granted, the, keys, of, the, kingdom, or, their, children, places, at, Eton., Instead, they, struggle, to, make, ends, meet,, they, take, on, debilitating, debts, that, take, lifetimes, to, repay;, a, life, of, anxiety, and, exhaustion,, incarcerated, in, work, (wage, labour)., This, is, the, negative-side, of, work,, its, positive-side, is, accumulated, capital,, itself, precarious., In, the, early, stages, of, capitalist, development, the, system, lacked, the, professionalisms, to, dragoon, its, potential, labouring, classes,, as, a, result, this, system, was, threatened, by, dissoluteness,, laziness,, depredation,, so, called,, at, the, time,, moral, weaknesses, (of, the, poor),, which, professional, application, transformed, into, criminality, (Foucault)., The, reification, of, society, had, begun, and, on, a, scientific, basis,, driven, by, the, reflexes, of, capital., But, the, path, to, correction, involves, dismantling, the, institutions, of, ‘correction’, and, leads, to, regaining, the, theoretical, high-ground,, where, lazy, people, are, free, to, roam, the, commons, and, do, the, wrong, thing,, and, live, confident, in, the, belief, that, they, are, the, measure, of, all, things., This, is, the, hard, problem, of, consciousness,, why, it, matters,, why, it, ferments, loathing,, and, why, I, need, to, wrestle, it, away, from, those, who, fear, our, disorders, of, mind,, which, (and, to, partly, mis-quote, and, entirely, out, of, context), ‘in’, our, ‘obscure, dens,, dimme, caves,, secret, closets,, merck, clowdie, taverns,, darcke, mistie, victualling, howses, both, loorckinge, hydinge, and, absenting’, ourselves,’, these, unrestrained, disorders, ferment, ‘even, on’, our, ‘ale, benches,, in, the, midst, of’, our, ‘tippling, jugges, and, quaffing, pottes,, great, reasoners, and, talkers, of, devine, matters, &, of, things, appending, unto, the, same.’, (Taken, from, TLS, 5887, review, of, Gerard, Kilroy’s, Edmund, Campion.),  , My, starting, point, with, the, problem, will, be, to, revisit, the, before-mentioned, Block, 2, Cell, 6, of, Invisible, Cells, &, Vanishing, Masses., The, point, will, be, to, extract, from, it, what, it, contains, about, consciousness,, putting, to, one, side, its, main, concern,, namely, the, negation, of, determinism,, although, its, positive, account, of, autonomy, is, very, much, integral, to, the, account, of, consciousness, I, want, to, give., The, extracted, content, will, be, amplified, to, yield, a, fully, articulated, theory, of, consciousness, as, an, irreducible,, physical, property,, the, nature, of, which, does, not, exceed, ordinary, language, and, ordinary, understanding., To, this, extent, consciousness, is, not, a, mystery,, and, the, efforts, to, make, out, that, it, is, amounting, to, theoretical, obfuscation:, a, means, of, gaining, control, of, the, conscious, by, denying, them, an, existence, beyond, religion, or, science,, denying, them, an, existence, within, invisible, cells, (Genet,, Taylor)., Alongside, the, idea, of, consciousness, as, an, irreducible, physical, property, and, fundamental, to, understanding, this, idea, two, other, concepts,, as, I, conceive, the, enterprise,, will, need, detailing., One, is, the, concept, of, direct, perception, and, the, other, the, concept, of, non-representational, thought., Two, concepts, challenging, to, the, axioms, of, science., Much, more, of, this, later.,  , This, then, will, constitute, the, exposition., I, add, to, the, exposition, a, bundle, of, notes,, unsystematic, reflections,, commentaries,, on, a, number, of, texts, (they, demonstrate, the, application, of, ideas, from, the, exposition, in, engaging, with, other, texts)., Reading, these, texts, has, accompanied, the, formation, of, my, approach, to, consciousness, and, the, notes, I, have, made, have, helped, in, clarifying, my, position, to, myself,, as, well, as, suggesting, to, me, a, range, of, topics, that, must, be, dealt, with, before, the, topic, as, a, whole, can, be, concluded., The, texts, are, Leibniz’s, Monadology,, Cooper, and, Leeuwen’s, Alan, Turing:, His, Work, and, Impact,, Strawson’s, Selves, and, Honderich’s, Actual, Consciousness, (all, weighty, undertakings, in, their, own, right)., As, will, become, obvious, there, has, been, much, reading, beyond, these, texts, but, only, these, have, compelled, commentary., I, include, these, notes, because, in, their, own, right, they, are, an, impression, of, how, being, conscious, of, something, can, unfold,, in, this, case, the, being, conscious, of, consciousness, as, a, subject., My, intention, though, is, never, academic,, never, scholarly., I, have, neither, the, time,, given, my, age,, the, resources,, nor, the, inclination, to, produce, a, definitive, textbook, for, students, or, a, work, competing, for, professional, advancement, (those, days, have, gone)., However,, it, is, my, intention, to, produce, a, work, of, rigorous, argument, and, grounded, vision, challenging, the, professional, treatments, of, the, subject, of, consciousness, both, in, philosophy, and, science., I, do, this, in, solidarity, with, what, I, call, the, vanishing, and, unnoticed, masses!, Quite, seriously, I, intend, this, as, a, substantial, addition, to, human, thought,, a, motivation,, ambition, or, possibly, a, grand, delusion, always, present, in, my, own, being, conscious.,  , Before, concluding, these, preliminaries, there, is, something, else., For, good, or, ill,, for, enlightenment, or, otherwise,, I, have, spent, much, of, my, life, in, philosophy., As, a, result, I, have, known, a, number, of, philosophers,, all,, and, how, could, they, be, anything, else,, conscious, beings., Their, being, conscious, beings, a, precondition, of, whatever, identity, or, particularity, they, possessed,, this, precondition, not, being, exclusive, to, philosophers, but, applying, to, almost, all, human, beings,, and, the, reason, why, not, applying, to, some, requiring, no, more, than, a, little, philosophical, imagination, to, determine., Of, the, philosophers, known, I, have, known, not, only, their, works, but, also, them, as, conscious, beings:, as, a, conscious, being, I, have, encountered, them, being, conscious., However,, many, of, those, I, have, known,, and, this, claim, would, be, contested,, no, longer, exist, as, conscious, beings;, they, have, died., Among, those, encountered, who, are, no, more, are, Thomas, Jessop,, Alan, White,, Stuart, Hampshire,, Richard, Wollheim,, Bernard, Williams,, Gerald, Cohen,, Timothy, Sprigge,, Sidney, Morgenbesser,, Anthony, Palmer., In, my, life, I, think, of, these, as, lights, that, no, longer, shine,, lights, whose, illuminations, I, attended, to, for, whatever, my, reasons,, and, those, reasons, were, many., But, what, my, exposition, and, demonstrations, are, about, is, that, being, dead, is, the, death, of, consciousness:, the, death, of, the, body, is, the, death, of, consciousness., So, in, my, account, dualism, has, no, future, whatsoever., And, the, reasons, why, these, deaths, entail, each, other, is, because, of, the, physicality, of, consciousness., Death, and, consciousness, are, absolute, limits, like, being, and, nothingness., Consciousness, is, physical, and, irreducible., There, is, nothing, underlying, which, it, is,, nothing, it, can, be, reduced, to,, it, is, as, we, understand, it,, prima, facie,, it, does, not, require, translation, into, a, more, fundamental, language., To, appreciate, what, it, is, we, have, to, enlarge,, upgrade, and, so, free-up, notions, of, the, physical,, which, for, too, long, have, been, the, prisoner, of, professional, science., The, problems, with, professional, science, is, that, it, confines, what’s, physical, by, means, of, a, metaphysical, straightjacket., Science, will, not, admit, this, though, because, it, cannot, entertain, that, it, is, so,, and, as, a, result, everything, has, to, be, squeezed, (reduced), into, its, confinements.,  , So,, for, these, reasons,, this, work, is, about, being, conscious, and, being, dead, but, without, ever, approaching, what, might, be, called, a, philosophy, of, death., This, work, is, materialist, and, autonomist., Understanding, it, will, be, a, difficult, struggle, but, so, will, be, writing, it.,  ,  , 3., THERESE, &, TIAMAT,  , Rumpledsilkskin, interviews, Roger, Taylor, about, his, new, book, THERESE, &, TIAMAT., (available, from, CreateSpace, and, Kindle),  ,  , Rumpledsilkskin:, Often, we, co-author, but, with, this, new, book, am, I, right, in, thinking, you, have, gone, it, alone?,  , Roger, Taylor:, Well,, you, are, right, to, have, phrased, the, question, that, way., You, might, think, you, would, know, whether, or, not, you, were, involved,, but, the, matter, is, not, so, simple., When, you, have, an, alter-ego,, or,, to, refer, to, your, case,, when, you, have, an, avatar,, it, is, not, always, clear, which, of, you, is, speaking., What, has, to, be, said, about, my, new, book, is, that, nowhere, does, it, acknowledge, you., However,, the, book, contains, two, narrative, voices,, one, the, narrator,, never, referred, to, as, such,, and, the, other, Scaramouche., The, relationship, between, the, two,, mirrors, in, many, ways, our, relationship,, not, that, I, am, able, to, define, precisely, any, of, these, ways.,  , Rumpledsilkskin:, So, there, is, a, character,, Scaramouche,, and, Scaramouche, is, Rumpledsilkskin?,  , Roger, Taylor:, Not, so, fast., To, begin, with,, my, new, book, does, not, contain, characters, in, the, authorial, sense., There, are, names, and, persons,, real,, historical,, as, well, as, fictional,, but, they, are, more, points, of, view, than, characters,, although, an, attempt, is, made, to, draw, a, certain, person, from, historical, obscurity, back, into, the, circle, of, life., Scaramouche,, on, the, other, hand,, is, a, personal,, narrative, voice, but, with, a, fantastical, history, within, the, events, of, the, book., These, things, are, not, true, of, the, other, narrative, voice,, which, is, more, deus, ex, machina, and, more, abstract., This, mirrors, our, relationship, without, either, of, us, being, in, the, book,, but, where, I, have, inputted, content, you, have, inputted, nothing,, although, if, we, were, not, related, in, the, way, we, are, then, this, book, would, not, have, the, structure, it, does, have.,  , Rumpledsilkskin:, Not, so, simple., Not, so, fast., Very, Roger, Taylor,, if, I, may, say, so., But, we, should, move, on., Your, new, book, is, called, Therese, &, Tiamat., So, what, is, it, about?, Can, I, ask, you, that?,  , Roger, Taylor:, Well,, for, now,, let’s, try, to, keep, things, simple, and, fast., Therese, &, Tiamat, is, about, the, unnoticed,, their, enemies,, about, their, escape, and, their, dreamtime.,  , Rumpledsilkskin:, So, who, are, the, unnoticed?,  , Roger, Taylor:, Let, me, give, you, an, example., The, medieval, serf., The, Magna, Carta, is, pure, ideology., It, has, nothing, to, do, with, democracy., It, is, anti-Semitic, and, sexist., It, concerns, the, class, of, what, was, called, freemen,, conveniently, and, wrongly, equated, with, everyman, in, contemporary, misinformation., Magna, Carta, details, their, property, rights, as, against, the, king,, detailing, the, taxes, the, rich, should, not, have, to, pay. , At, most, this, class, counted, for, 10%, of, the, population., The, rest, of, the, population, were, villeins,, the, serfs, or, peasants., They, were, noticed,, but, only, in, the, way, deer, and, salmon, were, noticed., They, were, not, celebrated, in, history, or, society,, in, this, sense, they, were, unnoticed,, apart,, that, is,, from, religion,, where, the, unnoticed, were, given, the, status, of, the, chosen, ones, as, long, as, they, remained, quiet, and, unnoticed,, thus, leaving, the, world, to, the, self-chosen;, freemen., The, fairly, recent, emergence, of, social, history, tries, to, redress, the, balance, but, given, the, subject, is, the, unnoticed, the, data, is, necessarily, scant, and, its, interpretation, prone, to, wishful-thinking.,  , Rumpledsilkskin:, If, this, is, so, how, is, it, you, have, a, subject, to, write, about?,  , Roger, Taylor:, Exactly, so., My, book, is, fantasy,, but, like, social, history, it, plays, with, the, available, data., Its, subject, is, not, the, medieval, serf, but, a, French, woman,, largely, unnoticed,, alive, in, the, C18th,, and, a, woman, who,, according, to, my, book,, was, midwife, to, the, French, Revolution, and, its, Terror.,  , Rumpledsilkskin:, This, woman, is, the, Thérèse, of, your, book?,  , Roger, Taylor:, Thérèse, Levasseur, is, my, uber-shrew., I, bring, her, into, the, light, from, obscurity, but, when, you, blink, she, is, gone, again,, as,, in, my, book,, Jean, Seberg, discovers. , My, thinking, about, her, is, wishful, yet, coincides, with, fact.,  , Rumpledsilkskin:, This, is, the, woman, who, lived, with, Jean, Jacques, Rousseau, as, his, servant., A, reputed, dullard, and,, well,, shrew?,  , Roger, Taylor:, She, was, scolding, ditch-water, in, the, eyes, of, the, intelligentsia, and, so, they, were, blind, to, a, tributary, leading, back, to, the, sea, of, Tiamat.,  , Rumpledsilkskin:, And, Tiamat, is, a, Babylonian, sea-dragon, and, goddess?,  , Roger, Taylor:, Pure, myth., I, connect, her, with, the, sentient, whole, at, the, centre, of, Naomi, Wolf’s, book, Vagina., Life, without, purpose,, anonymous, existence,, a, refusal, to, nominate, essence,, a, life, of, multiple, orgasm., Life, in, the, warm, waters, of, the, primeval, sea, before, the, urge, to, leave, these, waters, and, be, human., Life, before, culture, and, civilisation,, life, as, ecstatic, dream., It, is, this, Thérèse, glimpses, as, she, comes, to, terms, with, Rousseau’s, betrayal, of, her, and, the, trauma, it, introduces, to, her, life., Her, way, back, to, Tiamat, is, the, destruction, of, her, society, and, she, does, this, by, leading, Rousseau’s, theoretical, enterprise, far, beyond, territory, he, would, ever, have, had, the, courage, or, desire, to, cross, alone., She, is, there, at, the, birth, of, divine, being.,  , Rumpledsilkskin:, Well, an, avatar, can, live, with, that., She, is, also, present, at, the, death, of, divine, being., Am, I, understanding, you, correctly?,  , Roger, Taylor:, She, is, the, unseen, muse, in, Rousseau’s, life,, she, drives, him, mad, and, then, she, kills, him., These, things, I, have, her, do.,  , Rumpledsilkskin:, It, might, seem, the, distance, between, Thérèse, taking, her, honoured, seat, at, the, guillotine, to, watch, heads, being, freed, and, Tiamat, being, bitten, in, two, in, a, post-coital, frenzy, by, the, giant, Marduk, is, a, gap, too, far, for, any, narrative, to, sustain,, but, in, Thérèse, &, Tiamat, there, is, historical, linkage., Could, you, explain, this?,  , Roger, Taylor:, There, is, an, event, in, Sardis, in, 545, BC, when, a, baker, girl, is, sawn, in, two., This, is, a, re-enactment,, echoing, dividing, Tiamat, from, being, whole., It, is, an, attempt, to, conceal, an, orgasmic, existence, and, to, make, life, conform, to, rule,, purpose, and,, wait, for, it,, hard-work., The, dialectic, between, these, two, becomes, concentrated, in, an, effigy, of, the, girl,, in, two, halves., History, is, then, a, struggle, between, keeping, her, apart, or, bringing, her, together., The, struggle, between, the, rule, of, law, and, chaos,, the, forces, of, order, and, Assassins,, holy, women, and, harlots., Through, the, centuries, this, links, Lydia,, Delphi,, Constantinople,, Venice, and, in, culmination, the, Rousseau, family, in, Geneva:, from, ancient, history, to, the, Enlightenment., It, is, Thérèse, who, deconstructs, mythical, linkage, in, favour, of, natural,, tidal, change., Of, course, there, is, no, pre-existing, essence, but, neither, is, freedom, exercised, in, choosing, essence., There, is, no, essence,, only, existence,, constant, making, and, re-making,, the, flow, of, Eros, and, Thanatos., The, division, of, woman, is, a, fear, of, the, dialectic., Marduk, murders, because, he, lusts,, Thérèse, kills, because, she, loves., Thérèse, &, Tiamat, asserts, contradiction.,  , Rumpledsilkskin:, Well, thank, you., I, have, read, the, book, and, found, it, deeply, moving., It, is, also, very, funny., Perhaps, it, is, the, only, book, needed., I, would, say, read, it, a, million, times.,  , 4., NEWS, OF, 3, BOOKS,  , 3, BOOKS, associated, with, Rumpledsilkskin, are, now, available, from, Kindle, Books,  , Revised, edition, of, ART, an, ENEMY, of, the, PEOPLE, by, ROGER, TAYLOR.,  , Revised, edition, of, BEYOND, ART, by, ROGER, TAYLOR.,  , INVISIBLE, CELLS, and, VANISHING, MASSES, by, RUMPLEDSILKSKIN, and, ROGER, TAYLOR.,  , For, Rumpledsilkskin, these, books, represent, three, of, four, steps, towards, a, better, theory, of, consciousness., The, fourth, step, will, be, made, available, in, 2017., The, third, step, (INVISIBLE, CELLS, and, VANISHING, MASSES), is, the, most, recent, and, the, most, substantial., It, is, a, difficult,, 250,000-word, text., Its, individual, cells, have, the, conceit, of, being, prison, sentences, during, which, the, prisoner, battles, with, concepts, of, confinement, and, escape., A, sense, of, the, clamour, of, these, battles, is, all, Rumpledsilkskin, feels, able, to, offer, as, introduction, to, the, whole., Rumpledsilkskin, writes,,  , Part, of, my, subject, matter, is, to, give, serious, treatment, to, the, notion, of, “getting, out, of, it”,, another, part, concerns, who, is, to, get, out., The, inevitabilities, of, the, poor, are, the, factum,, the, starting, point., What, does, Bear, the, surfboard-maker, in, Big, Wednesday, say, as, the, surf, heroes, ride, the, unprecedented?, “Oh!, I’m, just, the, garbage, man.”, Generally, the, poor, are, addressed, to, improve, them,, educate, them,, edify, them,, empower, them,, sensitise, them,, quiet, them,, control, them., These, are, the, stratagems, for, creating, illusions, of, change., So, it, is, argued,, the, rich, are, going, to, have, to, overcome, hell, of, a, hump, to, get, into, heaven,, whereas, queuing, garbage, men, are, the, last, made, first., For, this, illusory, privilege, they, are, exhorted, to, love, those, who, trespass, against, them., My, work, is, firmly, set, in, the, notion, of, irreconcilable, enemies., Being, poor, is, to, confront, reality, as, problematic,, something, to, defend, oneself, against,, something, to, be, escaped, from., “Getting, out, of, it”, is, defence, and, escape,, and, virtuality, is, one, of, the, forms, of, “getting, out, of, it”., Socially, developed, and, controlled, forms, of, virtuality, are, generally, commodified,, but, commodified, entertainment, is, bootlegged, like, booze, and, has, its, non-commodified, forms, like, poteen, and, alpine, eau, de, vie., And,, of, course, the, objects, of, art, can, be, appropriated, for, any, purpose, whatsoever,, just, as, art, has, appropriated, the, objects, of, not, art, as, objects, of, art.,  , This, philosophical, journey, begun, a, long, time, ago,, whichever, moment, it, was, when, it, began,, is, now, to, be, completed, in, these, cells., There, was, no, way, for, me, to, have, envisaged, this, precise, ending, at, the, outset,, despite, a, determination, to, arrive, where, I, am., In, fact, at, the, beginning, I, did, not, even, possess, my, present, virtual, existence., The, destination, is, virtuality, and, class, and, underclass, and, escape., The, possibilities, of, virtuality, have, multiplied, since, I, started, my, kind, of, life., Those, possibilities, are, part, and, parcel, of, the, aspirations, of, self-consciousness, and, autonomy,, and, all, these, particles, including, the, aspirations, were, all, interwoven,, even, if, unrecognised,, in, the, embryonic, vision., And, so,, my, kind, of, life,, my, sentence,, starts, by, revisiting, and, reflecting, on, various, stopping, points, on, the, journey,, as, well, as, striking, out, across, a, vast, territory, still, uncrossed., Following, will, not, be, easy,, it, will, not, be, an, instant, thing,, and, the, subject, matter, is, irreducibly, difficult., For, escape, none, of, this, is, necessary,, but, for, the, defence, of, escape, it, may, well, be,, certainly, nothing, “out, there”, goes, half, far, enough.,  , There, is, a, collectiveness, to, vanishing,, a, shared, conspiracy., This, is, a, global,, empirical, scepticism., The, alternative, worlds, that, are, turned, to, and, created, take, both, individual, and, collective, forms., There, is, nothing, solipsistic, about, mass, disappearance., Moreover,, vanishing, is, always, double-edged., Spasmodically, the, masses, reappear., Suddenly, they, are, in, the, streets, pointing., The, excesses, of, the, existing, order, do, not, go, unnoticed., Or, they, reappear, as, heroes, to, fulfil, their, own, fantasies., But, the, masses, will, never, again, sacrifice, a, generation, or, two, for, a, future, that, never, comes., The, masses, are, playing, the, long, game, now., The, masses, are, playing, games., Fundamentalists, of, all, persuasions, desperately, struggle, to, bring, them, back., For, fundamentalists, the, life, of, the, masses, is, not, for, playing, games,, it, is, instead, austerity,, struggle, and, suffering,, but, this, is, a, megalomaniacal, game, fundamentalist, can, play, only, at, the, expense, of, the, masses, and, the, masses, have, found, ways, not, to, pay, the, price.,  , And, the, clamour, includes, this, digressive, prolegomenon, to, INVISIBLE, CELLS, AND, VANISHING, MASSES, (Kindle, Books).,  , PROLEGOMENON,  , The, Norwegian, would, not, be, a, problem, if, he, kept, the, world, he, inhabits, to, himself,, just, as, his, private, fantasy.,  , His, actual, behaviour, is, unintelligible, if, thought, embedded, in, wholesome, Scandinavian, society., Instead, though,, there,, like, everywhere,, is, as, tight, as, an, asthmatic, seizure., Screaming, Nordic, noir!, Pus-filled, globules, are, expelled, from, the, congested, mass, as, the, social, body, struggles, for, its, breath., It, is, asked, “Why?”, That, is, why,, no, longer, inexplicable, horror.,  , Murdering, someone, is, thought, clearly, wrong, but, imagining, murdering, someone, is, less, clear-cut., We, might, then, say, the, Norwegian, could, imagine, whatever, he, liked., This, is, close, to, the, foundation, of, the, argument, in, INVISIBLE, CELLS, AND, THE, VANISHING, MASSES, (ICVM)., But, nothing, is, clear-cut., In, Elizabethan,, political, culture, (Elizabeth, I), treason, laws, forbade, any, subject, to, “compass”, (imagine), the, death, of, a, monarch., Today, militant, Islam, is, just, as, eager, to, repress, deviant, daydreams., How, though, do, you, police, these, prescriptions?, Not, by, means, of, any, regard, for, the, truth., Instead, truth, gives, way, to, suspicion, and, policing, suspicion, requires, a, reign, of, terror,, in, which, case, imagining, is, left, intangible,, the, threat, to, it, accidental.,  , The, Australian, Outback, is, a, harsh, place,, and, how, did, the, aborigine, cope, there?, By, means, of, great, material, ingenuity, but, also, by, means, of, dreamtime., Walkabout, is, inhabiting, a, fantasy, landscape, formed, out, of, stories, about, the, old, woman, and, the, old, fella., There, is, an, element, of, religious, belief, about, this, but, it, is, more, comic, than, zealous,, more, fall-about, than, solemn., Unless, seduced, by, bourgeois, élitism, Abos, repudiate, high, seriousness., Dreamtime, is, for, having, a, good, time., It, allows, you, to, eat, your, babies, when, you’re, starving.,  , Communism, is, the, utilitarian, solution, to, perennial, exploitation, of, the, masses., It, was, once, popular, aspiration,, now, it, sounds, like, “smoking, is, good, for, you”., ICVM, will, demonstrate, the, rationality, of, communism, and, will, expose, the, repression, of, this, truth., However,, although, communism’s, moment, could, come, again,, its, use, in, ICVM, is, as, an, exemplar, or, measure,, rather, like, the, kingdom, of, heaven, is, used, to, measure, earthly, reality,, or, like, Rousseau’s, general, will, measures, existing, power, relations., Moreover,, one, reading, of, communism’s, end-game, is, of, virtual, existence, in, a, virtual, universe,, and, what, ICVM, argues, is, not, only, is, a, strand, of, this, always, possible, but, now, its, possibility, is, extensive,, yet, it, only, exists, by, proxy, in, the, form, of, mutant, virtuality,, which, is, virtual, escape, nonetheless, but,, therefore,, dismissible, by, the, media, as, criminal, insanity., Maybe, this, is, where, everything, is, stuck, for, a, virtual, eternity.,  , If, you, think, that, working, hard,, rolling, up, your, sleeves, and, doing, the, right, thing, is, sick,, if, you, think, that, all, of, morality, and, all, of, politics, is, sick,, if, you, think, all, religion, is, sick,, if, you, think, the, pursuit, of, knowledge, and, progress, and, economic, growth, is, sick,, if, you, think, all, of, these, are, diseases, of, private, property,, and, if, you, think, virtual, existence, for, its, own, sake, is, freedom, or, escape,, then, you, must, be, criminal, and, insane., Musn’t, you?, This, is, not, the, prerogative, of, a, starry, few,, as, Nietzsche, thought,, but, the, mass, nebulae, of, the, celestial, herd., This, criminality, and, insanity, is, the, commonsense, repudiation, of, received, sense,, and, things, are, so, fixed, that, what, repudiates, received, sense, is, axiomatically, criminal, and, insane., These, then, are, the, norms, and, whatever, challenges, them., Hegemony, creates, this, criminal, insanity.,  , People, are, leaving, the, social, space, but, media, society, does, its, utmost, to, prevent, this., Every, pretext, is, used., The, economic, crisis, is, used, to, preach, the, doctrine, of, all, being, in, it, together., The, Olympics, presents, an, idea, of, the, world, coming, together., Every, trick, is, used, to, secure, a, global,, secure,, benign, community, of, consumers., Awaiting, the, aftermath, of, global, bonding, in, the, stadia, is, a, giant, landscape, of, corporate, selling.,  , In, opposition, to, received, sense, what, we, have, is, a, dialectical, materialist, treatment, of, virtuality,, and, this, generates, both, a, critique, of, morality,, politics,, culture,, religion,, global, capitalism,, science,, philosophical, logic,, theory, of, mind,, celebrity,, as, well, as, a, defence, of, the, unnoticed,, anonymity, and, dreamtime.,  , What, is, completely, wrong, with, professional, psychiatry’s, analysis, of, mass, killers,, apart, from, the, spurious, idea, that, it, (the, analysis), is, the, first, port, of, call, in, order, to, achieve, understanding,, is, that, it, supposes, everything, is, revealed, by, the, set, of, lonely,, angry, fantasists., How, imprecise, is, this?, It, is, from, this, set, also, that, critical, theory, emanates., “All, the, lonely, people, where, do, they, all, come, from?”, The, antidote, to, conformist, socialisation, is, what, inflates, the, set, beyond, any, of, the, uses, of, psychiatric, explanation., As, though, the, distinction, between, fantasy, and, reality, is, self-evident., Was, monetarism, fantasy, or, reality?, Was, Thatcher, essentially, lonely?, Certainly, she, was, angry., Oh,, but, she, was, a, mass, killer, too!, So, the, theory, is, correct, then!, But, something, has, gone, wrong., “Of, course, it, has,, don’t, you, know, that, everything, is, measured, by, received, sense?”, Well, yes, everything, is, but, as, every, madman, complains, “You, measure, with, electro-convulsive, shock, and, how, long, is, an, electro-convulsive, shock?, Oh, yes!, However, long, you, say, it, is.”,  , The, vanishing, masses, and, their, invisible, cells, now, have, a, startling, analogue, or, image., The, Dutch, art-scientist,, Jalila, Essaidi, in, collaboration, with, Dr, Abdoel, El, Ghalbzouri, are, progressing, a, new, material., Some, are, calling, it, Rumpled, Silk, Skin., Human, skin, and, spider, silk, have, been, synthesised, by, way, of, first, adding, spider, genes, to, the, genome, of, goats,, then, separating, from, goat’s, milk, its, resulting, silky, content,, and, then, spinning, and, weaving, this, content, into, a, material, on, which, human, cells, are, grown., Why, should, you, do, this?, Jalila, was, inspired, by, a, tale, about, Genghis, Khan’s, horsemen, riding, into, battle, wearing, silk, vests, as, armour, against, enemy, arrows., Jalila, tried, firing, bullets, at, her, Rumpled, Silk, Skin, to, find, that, although, at, full, speed, the, bullets, penetrated,, at, reduced, speed, they, did, not., She, said,, moving, the, idea, even, further,, “…why, bother, with, a, vest:, imagine, replacing, keratin,, the, protein, responsible, for, the, toughness, of, human, skin,, with, this, spider, silk, protein.”,  , Rumpledsilkskin’s, idea, (this, web-sites, avatar, and, co-author, of, the, forthcoming, ICVM), predates, this, armour, of, mass, defence, by, some, 40, years., Both, ideas, point, to, protection,
