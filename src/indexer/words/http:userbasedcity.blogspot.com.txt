functioning, of, cities, as, complex, systems., I'm, sorry, tot, say, that, it, is, written, only, in, Dutch., 2, comments, 19.5.08, Basic, functioning, of, the, sim/game, A, scematic, overview, of, the, functioning, of, the, simulation/game:, Impuls, Central, growth, versus, decentral, growth, Modeling, and, simulation, Tests:, small, scale, tests, Heights:, Traffic, Calculations:, these, are, extracts, from, the, excell, file,, for, more, details, check, the, excell, file, itself, Larger, scale, tests:, Heights, Relation, of, the, city, to, it's, environnement?, 0, comments, 16.5.08, Scoring, system, -, calculations, I've, been, working, on, an, excell, file, to, do, calculations., I, have, absolutely, no, experience, with, excell, so, some, things, could, probably, have, been, done, a, lot, more, simple., So, if, you, see, something, in, there, that, could, be, better,, please, tell, The, excell, file, should, make, the, calculations, of, the, game, while, playing., This, means, that, I, would, constantly, need, to, ad, all, change, into, the, excell, file,, but, this, way, the, players, can, just, play, without, counting, all, the, time., It, also, makes, alot, more, complicated, things, possible, that, wouldn't, be, possible, otherwise., In, the, file, I, made, the, first, page, wich, basically, says, the, fucntion, of, each, tile., In, each, tile, there, is, a, combination, of, letters., The, first, one, gives, the, function,, next, the, height,, next, the, owner,, etc., This, way, I, can, just, add, all, the, info, on, one, tile, in, this, playing, field., In, the, next, tab, there, is, a, simple, viual, representation, wich, woul, possibly, make, things, easier, to, oversee., Then, the, other, tabs, do, calculations, based, on, the, current, situation., They, say, how, much, a, player, earns, each, round., They, dont, keep, track, of, what, a, player, owns,, or, what, he, buys,, builts,, etc., This, all, happens, in, RL, with, the, real, money., The, excell, file, just, says, how, much, a, player, will, earn, in, rent,, pay, taxes,, etc., If, you're, interested, take, a, look, here., I've, also, added, some, comments, in, the, excell, itself, about, specific, questions, I, had., Maybe, some, of, you, are, more, experienced, with, excell, and, can, help, me, out, there, XLS:, http://colsonalexander.googlepages.com/GAMEEXCELL.xls,

Technorati, Profile, 19.4.08, Physical, boardgame, -, limitations?, The, matrix, system, can, be, transformed, into, a, more, simple, system, quiete, easily:, Which, would, lead, to, a, scoreboard, similar, to, this., Which, gives, you, the, total, tax, for, each, builing, height, (per, building,, not, all, buildings, together)., And, the, increase, in, case, you, are, just, adding, new, floors,, for, simpler, calculations:, But, a, first, problem, is, the, incentive, side, of, it., Normaly, players, surrounding, a, high, building, recieve, most, compensation., But, with, system, like, above,, which, is, not, space-specific, this, isn't, possible., Here, an, exaple, of, how, it, would, work, with, the, matrix, system:, Another, proble, is,, how, do, you, actually, make, it, interesting, for, a, player, not, to, build, on, that, piece, of, land., Because, giving, it, a, high, incentive, might, compensate, the, fact, that, it, is, closed, in,, but, wont, stop, the, player, from, building, a, skyscraper, on, it, for, example., 0, comments, 18.4.08, Game, Design, Document, Here, is, the, general, explanation, of, what, a, User, Based, City, -, Game, should, be, able, to,

usage,, complexity, often, tends, to, be, used, to, characterize, something, with, many, parts, in, intricate, arrangement., In, science, there, are, at, this, time, a, number, of, approaches, to, characterizing, complexity,, many, of, which, are, reflected, in, this, article., Seth, Lloyd, of, M.I.T., writes, that, he, once, gave, a, presentation, which, set, out, 32, definitions, of, complexity.[1], Complex, systems, is, a, subfield, of, a, systems, science, or, systemics,, which, studies, the, common, properties, of, systems, considered, complex, in, nature,, society, and, science., It, is, also, called, complex, systems, theory,, complexity, science,, study, of, complex, systems, and/or, sciences, of, complexity., The, key, problems, of, such, systems, are, difficulties, with, their, formal, modeling, and, simulation., From, such, perspective,, in, different, research, contexts, complex, systems, are, defined, on, the, base, of, their, different, attributes., At, present,, the, consensus, related, to, one, universal, definition, of, complex, system, does, not, exist, yet., In, these, endeavors,, scientists, often, seek, simple, non-linear, coupling, rules, which, lead, to, complex, phenomena, (rather, than, describe, -, see, above),, but, this, need, not, be, the, case., Human, societies, (and, probably, human, brains), are, complex, systems, in, which, neither, the, components, nor, the, couplings, are, simple., Nevertheless,, they, exhibit, many, of, the, hallmarks, of, complex, systems., Complex, adaptive, systems, are, special, cases, of, complex, systems., They, are, complex, in, that, they, are, diverse, and, made, up, of, multiple, interconnected, elements, and, adaptive, in, that, they, have, the, capacity, to, change, and, learn, from, experience., The, term, complex, adaptive, systems, (CAS), was, coined, at, the, interdisciplinary, Santa, Fe, Institute, (SFI),, by, John, H., Holland,, Murray, Gell-Mann, and, others., Emergence:, In, philosophy,, systems, theory, and, the, sciences,, emergence, refers, to, the, way, complex, systems, and, patterns, arise, out, of, a, multiplicity, of, relatively, simple, interactions., Emergence, is, central, to, the, theory, of, complex, systems., For, professor, Jeffrey, Goldstein,, emergence, can, be, defined, as:, "the, arising, of, novel, and, coherent, structures,, patterns, and, properties, during, the, process, of, self-organization, in, complex, systems."(Corning, 2002), Systems, theory, is, an, interdisciplinary, field, of, science, and, the, study, of, the, nature, of, complex, systems, in, nature,, society,, and, science., More, specificially,, it, is, a, framework, by, which, one, can, analyze, and/or, describe, any, group, of, objects, that, work, in, concert, to, produce, some, result., This, could, be, a, single, organism,, any, organization, or, society,, or, any, electro-mechanical, or, informational, artifact., Living, systems, theory, is, a, general, theory, about, the, existence, of, all, living, systems,, their, structure,, interaction,, behavior, and, development., This, work, is, created, by, James, Grier, Miller,, which, was, intended, to, formalize, the, concept, of, "life"., According, to, Miller's, original, conception, as, spelled, out, in, his, magnum, opus, Living, Systems,, a, "living, system", must, contain, each, of, 20, "critical, subsystems",, which, are, defined, by, their, functions, and, visible, in, numerous, systems,, from, simple, cells, to, organisms,, countries,, and, societies., Systems, Thinking:, It, is, a, unique, approach, to, problem, solving,, in, that, it, views, certain, 'problems', as, a, part, of, the, overall, system, so, focusing, on, these, outcomes, will, only, further, develop, the, undesired, element, or, problem., Systems, thinking, is, a, framework, that, is, based, on, the, belief, that, the, component, parts, of, a, system, will, act, differently, when, the, systems, relationships, are, removed, and, it, is, viewed, in, isolation., The, only, way, to, fully, understand, why, a, problem, or, element, occurs, and, persists, is, to, understand, the, part, in, relation, to, the, whole.Standing, in, contrast, to, Descartes',, scientific, reductionism, and, philosophical, analysis,, it, proposes, to, view, systems, in, a, holistic, manner., Consistent, with, systems, philosophy,, systems, thinking, concerns, an, understanding, of, a, system, by, examining, the, linkages, and, interactions, between, the, elements, that, comprise, the, entirety, of, the, system., Systems, thinking, attempts, to, illustrate, that, events, are, separated, by, distance, and, time, and, that, small, catalytic, events, can, cause, large, changes, in, complex, systems., Acknowledging, that, an, improvement, in, one, area, of, a, system, can, adversely, affect, another, area, of, the, system,, it, promotes, organizational, communication, at, all, levels, in, order, to, avoid, the, silo, effect., Systems, thinking, techniques, may, be, used, to, study, any, kind, of, system, —, natural,, scientific,, engineered,, human,, or, conceptual., Autopoiesis, literally, means, "auto, (self)-creation", (from, the, Greek:, auto, -, αυτό, for, self-, and, poiesis, -, ποίησις, for, creation, or, production), and, expresses, a, fundamental, dialectic, between, structure, and, function., The, term, autopoiesis, was, originally, conceived, as, an, attempt, to, characterize, the, nature, of, living, systems., A, canonical, example, of, an, autopoietic, system, is, the, biological, cell., The, eukaryotic, cell,, for, example,, is, made, of, various, biochemical, components, such, as, nucleic, acids, and, proteins,, and, is, organized, into, bounded, structures, such, as, the, cell, nucleus,, various, organelles,, a, cell, membrane, and, cytoskeleton., These, structures,, based, on, an, external, flow, of, molecules, and, energy,, produce, the, components, which,, in, turn,, continue, to, maintain, the, organized, bounded, structure, that, gives, rise, to, these, components., An, autopoietic, system, is, to, be, contrasted, with, an, allopoietic, system,, such, as, a, car, factory,, which, uses, raw, materials, (components), to, generate, a, car, (an, organized, structure), which, is, something, other, than, itself, (a, factory)., More, generally,, the, term, autopoiesis, resembles, the, dynamics, of, a, non-equilibrium, system;, that, is,, organized, states, (sometimes, also, called, dissipative, structures), that, remain, stable, for, long, periods, of, time, despite, matter, and, energy, continually, flowing, through, them., From, a, very, general, point, of, view,, the, notion, of, autopoiesis, is, often, associated, with, that, of, self-organization., However,, an, autopoietic, system, is, autonomous, and, operationally, closed,, in, the, sense, that, every, process, within, it, directly, helps, maintaining, the, whole., Autopoietic, systems, are, structurally, coupled, with, their, medium, in, dialect, dynamic, of, changes, that, can, be, recalled, as, sensory-motor, coupling., This, continuous, dynamics, is, considered, as, knowledge, and, can, be, observed, throughout, life-forms., An, application, of, the, concept, to, sociology, can, be, found, in, Luhmann's, Systems, Theory., Control, theory, is, an, interdisciplinary, branch, of, engineering, and, mathematics,, that, deals, with, the, behavior, of, dynamical, systems., The, desired, output, of, a, system, is, called, the, reference., When, one, or, more, output, variables, of, a, system, need, to, follow, a, certain, reference, over, time,, a, controller, manipulates, the, inputs, to, a, system, to, obtain, the, desired, effect, on, the, output, of, the, system., Cybernetics, is, the, interdisciplinary, study, of, the, structure, of, complex, systems,, especially, communication, processes,, control, mechanisms, and, feedback, principles., Cybernetics, is, closely, related, to, control, theory, and, systems, theory., The, term, cybernetics, stems, from, the, Greek, Κυβερνήτης, (kybernetes,, steersman,, governor,, pilot,, or, rudder, —, the, same, root, as, government)., Cybernetics, is, a, broad, field, of, study,, but, the, essential, goal, of, cybernetics, is, to, understand, and, define, the, functions, and, processes, of, systems, that, have, goals,, and, that, participate, in, circular,, causal, chains, that, move, from, action, to, sensing, to, comparison, with, desired, goal, to, action., Studies, of, this, field, are, all, ultimately, means, of, examining, different, forms, of, systems, and, applying, what, is, known, to, make, the, design, and, function, of, any, system,, including, artificial, systems, such, as, business, management,, more, efficient, and, effective., Collective, intelligence, is, a, form, of, intelligence, that, emerges, from, the, collaboration, and, competition, of, many, individuals., Collective, intelligence, appears, in, a, wide, variety, of, forms, of, consensus, decision, making, in, bacteria,, animals,, humans,, and, computers., The, study, of, collective, intelligence, may, properly, be, considered, a, subfield, of, sociology,, of, business,, of, computer, science,, and, of, mass, behavior, —, a, field, that, studies, collective, behavior, from, the, level, of, quarks, to, the, level, of, bacterial,, plant,, animal,, and, human, societies., Swarm, intelligence, (SI), is, artificial, intelligence, based, on, the, collective, behavior, of, decentralized,, self-organized, systems., The, expression, was, introduced, by, Gerardo, Beni, and, Jing, Wang, in, 1989,, in, the, context, of, cellular, robotic, systems., SI, systems, are, typically, made, up, of, a, population, of, simple, agents, interacting, locally, with, one, another, and, with, their, environment., Although, there, is, no, centralized, control, structure, dictating, how, individual, agents, should, behave,, local, interactions, between, such, agents, lead, to, the, emergence, of, global, behavior., Natural, examples, of, SI, include, ant, colonies,, bird, flocking,, animal, herding,, bacterial, growth,, and, fish, schooling., In, SI, systems,, the, agents, follow, very, simple, rules, generally, out, of, the, need, for, survial, which, leads, to, very, complex, rules/algorithms, at, the, systems, level., The, application, of, swarm, principles, to, robots, is, called, swarm, robotics,, while, 'swarm, intelligence', refers, to, the, more, general, set, of, algorithms., Game, theory, is, a, branch, of, applied, mathematics, which, is, used, in, the, social, sciences, (most, notably, economics),, biology,, computer, science, and, philosophy., Game, theory, attempts, to, mathematically, capture, behavior, in, strategic, situations,, where, an, individual's, success, in, making, choices, depends, on, the, choices, of, others., While, initially, developed, to, analyze, competitions, where, one, individual, does, better, at, another's, expense, (zero, sum, games),, it, has, been, expanded, to, treat, a, wide, class, of, interactions,, which, are, classified, according, to, several, criteria., Location, Visitors, Translate, Blog,  ]
