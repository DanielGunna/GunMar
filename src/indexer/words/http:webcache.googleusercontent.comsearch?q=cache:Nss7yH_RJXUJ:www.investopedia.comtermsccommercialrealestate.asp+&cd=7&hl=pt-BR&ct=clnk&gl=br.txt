Newsletters, Site, Log, In, Advisor, Insights, Log, In, Commercial, Real, Estate, Share, What, is, 'Commercial, Real, Estate', Commercial, real, estate, is, property, that, is, used, solely, for, business, purposes, and, that, are, leased, out, to, provide, a, workspace, rather, than, a, living, space., Ranging, from, a, single, gas, station, to, a, huge, shopping, center,, commercial, real, estate, includes, retailers, of, all, kinds,, office, space,, hotels,, strip, malls,, restaurants, and, convenience, stores., Next, Up, Real, Estate, Single, Net, Lease, Private, Equity, Real, Estate, Gross, Lease, BREAKING, DOWN, 'Commercial, Real, Estate', Commercial, real, estate, is, one, of, the, three, main, types, of, real, estate,, along, with, residential, and, industrial., As, its, name, implies,, commercial, real, estate, is, used, in, commerce, (residential, real, estate, is, used, for, living, purposes,, while, industrial, real, estate, is, used, for, the, manufacture, and, production, of, goods)., While, some, businesses, own, the, buildings, they, occupy,, the, more, typical, scenario, is, that, an, investor, owns, the, building, and, collects, rent, from, each, business, that, operates, there., While, residential, real, estate, lease, rates, may, be, quoted, in, an, annual, sum, or, a, monthly, rent,, commercial, real, estate, is, customarily, quoted, in, annual, rental, dollars, per, square, foot. , Lease, Lowdown, Leases, can, run, from, one, year, to, 10, years, or, more,, with, office, and, retail, space, typically, averaging, from, five, to, 10, years., “Larger, tenants, tend, to, have, longer, leases,”, said, Brian, McAuliffe,, an, executive, managing, director, in, CBRE, Group's, (CBG), Capital, Markets, division., “Shorter-term, leases, provide, more, flexibility, to, adjust, lease, rents, while, longer, leases, provide, more, security,, especially, with, credit, tenants.”, (For, more,, see:, Exploring, Real, Estate, Investments.), There, are, four, primary, types, of, commercial, property, leases,, each, requiring, different, levels, of, responsibility, from, the, landlord, and, the, tenant., A, single, net, lease, makes, the, tenant, responsible, for, paying, property, taxes., A, double-net, (NN), lease, makes, the, tenant, responsible, for, paying, property, taxes, and, insurance., A, triple-net, (NNN), lease, makes, the, tenant, responsible, for, paying, property, taxes,, insurance, and, maintenance., Under, a, gross, lease,, the, tenant, pays, only, rent,, and, the, landlord, pays, for, the, building's, property, taxes,, insurance, and, maintenance., Commercial, Real, Estate, Classifications, Commercial, real, estate, is, categorized, into, different, classes., Office, space,, for, example,, is, divided, into, one, of, three, classes:, class, A,, class, B, or, class, C., Class, A, represents, the, best, buildings, in, terms, of, aesthetics,, age,, quality, of, infrastructure, and, location., Class, B, buildings, are, usually, older, and, not, as, good-looking, as, Class, A, buildings., These, buildings, are, often, targeted, by, investors, for, restoration., Class, C, buildings, are, the, oldest,, usually, over, 20, years, of, age,, located, in, less, attractive, areas, and, in, need, of, maintenance., Commercial, Real, Estate, Companies, A, commercial, real, estate, firm, advises, on, how, to, best, negotiate, lease, agreements, that, will, attract, and, keep, tenants, —, property, owners, need, to, strike, a, balance, between, maximizing, rents, and, minimizing, vacancies, and, tenant, turnover., Turnover, can, be, costly, for, owners, because, a, space, must, be, adapted, to, meet, the, specific, needs, of, different, tenants, —, say,, if, a, restaurant, is, moving, into, a, property, once, occupied, by, a, yoga, studio. , There, are, many, firms, in, the, commercial, real, estate, space., CBRE, is, the, largest, in, the, world., Other, big, players, include, Jones, Lang, LaSalle,, Cushman, &, Wakefield,, Inc.,, Newmark, Grubb, Knight, Frank,, and, DTZ., These, companies, help, source, commercial, real, estate,, appraise, value,, broker, purchases, and, sales,, manage, upkeep,, find, and, retain, tenants,, negotiate, leases,, and, navigate, financing, options., “A, full-service, company, satisfies, all, of, a, client's, real, estate, needs,, whether, they, be, individuals,, limited, partnerships, or, institutions,”, said, McAuliffe. , The, specialized, knowledge, of, a, commercial, real, estate, company, is, helpful, as, the, rules, and, regulations, governing, such, property, vary, by, state,, county,, municipality, and, industry, and, size., Commercial, Real, Estate, Outlook, The, U.S., commercial, property, market, took, a, hit, during, the, 2008-2009, recession,, but, it, has, experienced, annual, gains, since, 2010, and, has, since, recovered, almost, all, recession-era, losses., Washington-based, Urban, Land, Institute, recently, released, a, forecast, of, real, estate, trends, that, predicts, commercial, real, estate, prices, will, continue, to, sharply, rise, for, another, year., The, Real, Estate, Consensus, Forecast, surveyed, 46, industry, economists, and, analysts., It, sees, commercial, property, increasing, an, average, of, 7.6%, annually, through, 2017,, which, is, up, from, historical, long-term, increases, of, 5.3%, annually., (For, related, reading,, see:, Will, Higher, Interest, Rates, Crush, Real, Estate?), The, rents, collected, from, commercial, property, are, also, on, the, rise., Newmark, Grubb, Knight, Frank, recently, reported, that, the, national, average, for, office, space, rent, was, $27.76, a, square, foot, in, the, first, quarter, of, 2015,, up, 4%, from, a, year, earlier,, while, the, price, asked, for, industrial, space, was, $5.70, a, square, foot,, up, 7%.,  , Investing, in, Commercial, Real, Estate, Investing, in, commercial, real, estate, can, be, lucrative, and, serve, as, a, good, hedge, against, the, volatility, of, the, stock, market., Investors, can, make, money, via, appreciation, when, they, sell,, but, most, returns, are, generated, through, rents, collected, from, tenants., In, most, cases,, properties, are, sold, by, the, building, —, one, office, building,, one, restaurant,, one, factory,, etc., However,, if, a, developer, wants, more, capital, to, expand, a, project, or, wishes, to, see, the, returns, more, quickly,, the, project, will, be, broken, down, into, smaller, units, rather, than, sold, as, a, whole., (To, read, more, about, commercial, properties,, check, out, our, Exploring, Real, Estate, Investments, tutorial.), Advantages, to, Commercial, Real, Estate, One, of, the, biggest, advantages, of, commercial, real, estate, is, the, attractive, leasing, rates., In, areas, where, the, amount, of, new, construction, is, either, limited, by, land, or, law,, commercial, real, estate, can, have, impressive, returns, and, considerable, monthly, cash, flow., Industrial, buildings, generally, rent, at, a, lower, rate,, though, they, also, have, lower, overhead, costs, compared, to, an, office, tower., Commercial, real, estate, also, benefits, from, comparably, longer, lease, contracts, with, tenants, than, residential, real, estate., This, gives, the, commercial, real, estate, holder, a, considerable, amount, of, cash, flow, stability,, as, long, as, the, building, is, occupied, by, long-term, tenants., Disadvantages, to, Commercial, Real, Estate, Rules, and, regulations, are, the, primary, deterrent, for, most, people, wanting, to, invest, in, commercial, real, estate., The, taxes,, mechanics, of, purchase, and, maintenance, responsibilities, for, commercial, properties, are, buried, in, layers, of, legalese, that, shift, according, to, state,, county,, industry,, size,, zoning, and, many, other, designations., Most, investors, in, commercial, real, estate, either, have, specialized, knowledge, or, a, payroll, of, people, who, do., Another, hurdle, is, the, increased, risk, brought, with, tenant, turnover., With, residences,, the, facilities, requirements, of, a, given, tenant, are, almost, the, same, as, any, previous, or, future, tenant., With, a, commercial, property,, each, tenant, may, have, very, different, needs, that, require, costly, refurbishing. , The, building, owner, then, has, to, adapt, the, space, to, accommodate, each, tenant's, specialized, trade., A, commercial, property, with, low, vacancy, but, high, tenant, turnover, may, still, lose, money, due, to, the, cost, of, renovations, for, incoming, tenants., Who, Should, Invest, Those, who, have, a, business,, for, starters., It, can, be, financially, beneficial, to, own, your, own, workspace, rather, than, rent, it., Aside, from, that,, people, best, suited, for, investing, in, commercial, real, estate, are, those, who, either, have, a, considerable, amount, of, knowledge, about, the, industry, and, its, legal,, financial, and, regulatory, aspects,, or, can, employ, people, who, do., Commercial, properties, area, high-risk,, high-reward, area, of, real, estate, investing, that, will, appeal, to, sophisticated, investors, looking, for, a, challenge., As, you, may, have, guessed,, such, an, investor, is, likely, to, already, be, a, high, net, worth, individual:, Investing, often, requires, a, considerable, amount, of, startup, capital., That, said,, there, is, a, wide, range, of, commercial, properties,, from, mega, malls, and, office, towers, to, small, warehouses, and, single, shop, buildings., When, looking, at, commercial, properties, purely, as, an, investment,, the, most, important, factor, is, supply, and, demand., The, ideal, property, is, located, in, an, area, where, vacancy, is, low, and, the, space, available, for, new, developments, is, limited., Low, supply, and, high, demand, means, favorable, rental, rates, as, well, as, the, hedge, of, a, higher, rate, of, appreciation., The, strength, of, the, local, economy, of, the, area, will, also, affect, the, value, of, your, purchase,, so, you, will, want, to, check, employment, rates, via, the, Bureau, of, Labor, Statistics, (BLS), along, with, other, economic, growth, and, strength, metrics., Whatever, sort, of, property,, or, scale,, you, can, think, of,, just, make, sure, that, you, can, handle, the, time, and, costs, associated, with, an, investment, in, commercial, real, estate., How, to, Invest:, Directly, Finding, direct, investments, is, straightforward: Commercial, real, estate, firms, like, those, listed, above, all, have, a, range, of, listings, nationwide., Prominent, websites, for, residential, property,, such, as, Trulia, and, Realtor.com,, also, include, searchable, databases, of, commercial, listings., Another, site,, LoopNet,, specializes, in, commercial, property., An, investor, can, purchase, a, small, retail, space, or, storage, center, directly, or, through, a, private, partnership,, but, the, down, payment, requirements, tend, to, be, much, higher, than, for, residential, properties:, think, 30%, at, least., Real, estate, limited, partnerships, are, another, option,, though, these, also, often, require, a, considerable, investment., How, to, Invest:, Indirectly, Michael, Orzano, director, of, global, equity, indices, at, S&P, Dow, Jones, Indices, —, it, puts, out, the, S&P/Case-Shiller, Home, Price, Indices,, a, leading, measure, of, home, prices, in, the, U.S., —, cautions, against, buying, property, outright,, given, the, many, headaches, that, plague, management, companies, and/or, landlords:, “Direct, investment, in, commercial, real, estate, is, not, practical, for, most, investors,, given, the, large, investment, required, to, purchase, a, single, property, and, the, oversight, required, to, manage, the, building, or, buildings.”, Investors, who, don't, want, to, deal, with, all, the, hassles, of, direct, ownership, (or, don't, have, the, capital, to, purchase, entire, properties), can, still, get, into, the, game, in, several, ways., One, is, via, real, estate, investment, trusts, (REITs)., Commercial, real, estate, REITs, hold, a, portfolio, of, properties, (as, a, mutual, fund, holds, stocks, or, bonds),, but, are, publicly, traded;, this, makes, them, easy, to, buy, and, sell,, providing, liquidity, in, a, field, that, is, notoriously, illiquid., The, managers, of, REITs, handle, all, the, details, of, purchase,, maintenance,, tenants,, and, so, on., They, also, receive, special, tax, considerations, and, typically, offer, investors, high, yields;, they, can, be, geared, towards, providing, income,, capital, appreciation, or, both., “The, most, convenient, way, for, most, individual, investors, to, tap, the, commercial, real, estate, marketplace, is, through, REITs,”, says, Christian, Thomas,, an, investment, consultant, with, Glastonbury,, Conn.-based, USI, Advisors., “REITs, were, established, by, Congress, just, for, that, purpose,, and, most, have, daily, pricing.”, (For, more,, see:, What, Are, the, Risks, of, REITs?)., And,, if, you, want, further, diversification,, "index-based, products,, such, as, ETFs, that, track, property, and, REIT, benchmarks,, provide, a, cost-effective, means, of, accessing, a, diversified, portfolio, of, REITs,”, Orzano, notes., (See, the, performance, chart, of, one, such,, the, iShares, Industrial/Office, Real, Estate, ETF,, below.), Another, way, to, tap, into, the, commercial, realm, is, via, commercial, mortgage-backed, securities, (CMBS),, interest-paying, bonds, that, hold, bundles, of, commercial, mortgages., Issuance, of, CMBS is, expected, to, rise, to, $150, billion, in, 2017, from, an, anticipated, $115, billion, in, 2015,,
