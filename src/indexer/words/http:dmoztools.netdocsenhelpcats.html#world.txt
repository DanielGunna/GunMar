DMOZ, editors, determine, the, exact, placement, of, each, site, listed, in, the, directory, based, on, its, content., You, should, pick, one, category, where, you'd, like, your, site, to, be, listed., To, expedite, the, review, process,, try, to, pick, the, specific, category, that, corresponds, to, the, subject, matter, of, the, site., Suggesting, to, a, category, that, is, too, broad,, or, only, marginally, related, to, the, sites, content,, will, significantly, delay, the, site, from, being, reviewed, and, listed., DMOZ, categories, are, specialized, enough, so, that, in, most, cases, a, site, doesn't, need, to, be, listed, in, more, than, one, place., If, a, site, offers, information, on, a, wide, variety, of, topics,, it, will, be, placed, in, a, broader, category, rather, than, in, many, specialized, subcategories., For, example,, if, you, have, a, site, selling, tickets, for, concerts,, football, games,, and, amusement, parks,, the, site, would, not, be, placed, in, all, three, categories., It, will, most, likely, be, placed, in, a, category, for, site, selling, tickets, to, entertainment, events., If, your, site, is, focused, on, a, specific, regional, area,, you, may, suggest, your, site, to, both, a, subject, category,, and, a, category, in, the, Regional, branch., Can, I, be, listed, in, the, same, category, as, my, competitor?, DMOZ, prides, itself, on, being, a, Web, resource, free, of, commercial, bias, and, self-interest., Volunteer, editors, list, sites, in, the, most, appropriate, category, solely, based, on, content, found, on, the, site., Editors, do, not, consider, a, company's, competitors, when, listing, a, site., My, competitor's, site, is, listed,, why, isn't, mine?, Each, site, is, reviewed, individualy, and, objectively,, on, a, case-by-case, basis., Only, the, content, of, the, site, is, reviewed,, and, no, consideration, is, given, to, if, or, how, a, competitor's, site, is, listed., Why, is, my, site, only, listed, in, the, Regional, branch?, A, site, is, listed, in, Regional, branch, when, it, provides, information, about, a, specific, region,, and/or, when, it, is, directly, relevant, to, a, population, within, a, specific, geographic, area., Where, do, non-English, web, sites, get, listed?, All, sites, containing, non-English, language, content, should, be, listed, under, the, respective, language, under, World., Check, out, the, category, description, and, the, FAQ, for, the, World, category, for, more, information, about, this, area, of, DMOZ., Where, do, Adult, oriented, sites, get, listed?, All, sexually, explicit, sites, are, listed, in, the, Adult, category., Please, do, not, suggest, sexually, explicit, sites, to, categories, outside, the, Adult, branch., DMOZ, has, strict, policies, not, to, list, these, sites, outside, the, Adult, branch., The, Adult, category, has, PICS, tags, to, prevent, child, safe, browsers, from, accessing, that, part, of, the, directory., The, Adult, category, does, not, show, up, on, the, main, DMOZ, page., See, the, official, Adult, Guidelines,, as, well, as, the, Adult, FAQ, for, more, information, regarding, DMOZ, policy, about, adult, content., Does, DMOZ, have, a, category, sites, targeted, to, Kids, and, Teens?, In, an, effort, to, ensure, safe, searching, for, our, younger, audience,, DMOZ, has, developed, a, "Kid, Safe", area, of, the, directory, with, specific, guidelines, targeted, toward, child, safety, on, the, Internet., The, Kids, and, Teens, directory, is, linked, on, the, front, page, of, DMOZ., Not, only, unique, in, its, design,, Kids, and, Teens, is, actually, a, semi-separate, community, within, DMOZ., How, do, I, suggest, a, new, category?, We, welcome, all, suggestions, for, new, categories!, You, can, send, your, request, to, the, editor, of, the, parent, category, where, you'd, like, the, new, category, created,, make, your, suggestion, in, our, public, forum,, Resource-Zone, or, you, can, send, your, suggestion, to, DMOZ, Staff., Due, to, the, volume, of, requests, and, feedback,, staff, may, not, be, able, to, inform, you, of, our, decision., Last, update:, Sun, Jul, 03, 07:48, EDT, 2016,
