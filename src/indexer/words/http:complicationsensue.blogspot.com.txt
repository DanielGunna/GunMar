firebrand, for, writers., And, a, good, friend., And, a, wit,, and, a, style,, and, a, voice., Damn, it., I, met, Denis, McGrath, on, a, plane, to, South, Africa., We, were, parachuting, in, on, a, show, where, the, previous, writing, team,, who, were, on, a, plane, going, the, other, way,, had, not, got, along, too, well, with, the, showrunner., When, we, got, there,, we, had, to, retcon, some, sort, of, sense, out, of, the, episodes, that, had, been, shot,, and, then, rewrite, the, next, script, literally, over, the, course, of, 24, hours., We, got, along, like, gangbusters., Denis, was, a, New, York, native, who'd, moved, to, Toronto, as, a, kid., He, was, big,, and, he, was, loud,, and, he, was, funny,, and, he, was, whip, smart., He, liked, to, complain., He, was, generous., He, cared., He, loved, stories., We, spent, a, lot, of, time, breaking, story, above, a, nice, restaurant,, having, them, bring, us, takeout, on, actual, plates,, since, we, were, right, upstairs., We, decided, his, talk, show, would, be, called,, "Here's, Why, I, Hate, That.", A, couple, years, later,, Denis, and, I, instigated, the, Writer, Mafia, Party, At, TIFF,, which, became, an, annual, event, for, a, decade., Starting, at, The, Paddock, and, moving, to, Czehoski,, it, was, the, antidote, to, all, the, producer, parties, at, the, Toronto, International, Film, Festival., No, free, drinks,, but, your, friends, were, there., Like, him,, it, was, big,, it, was, loud,, it, was, fun,, it, was, packed, to, the, gills, with, brains, and, creativity., He, would, hold, court, at, the, Writer, Mafia, Party., He, did, not, get, around, easily,, so, friends, would, come, to, him,, and, bask, in, him., He, always, had, a, bunch, of, Ryerson, kids, around, him, who, were, starting, to, break, in., He, was, one, of, the, top, television, writers, in, Canada,, but, he, also, taught,, because, he, didn't, want, to, keep, it, all, for, himself., He, said, in, every, class, there, was, one, kid, you, knew, was, going, to, do, it., That, was, my, experience, too., You, really, taught, the, class, for, that, one, kid, that, had, it., He, had, a, million, friends;, he, had, a, few, bosom, buddies, who, went, back, to, his, high, school, days., But, he, always, made, time, for, me, when, I, showed, up, in, town., He, was, a, hell, of, a, writer., He, was, certainly, one, of, the, best, television, writers, in, Canada., When,, as, a, juror, for, the, WGC, awards,, I, read, a, script, that, really, popped,, more, than, once, it, turned, out, to, be, Denis's., I, remember, an, episode, of, The, Border, where, every, act, out, not, only, amped, the, story, out,, it, made, you, have, to, rethink, everything, you'd, seen, up, to, then., He, blogged, passionately., He, got, himself, in, trouble, calling, a, certain, very, powerful, individual, a, fatuous, gasbag,, someone, who, could, easily, reach, out, and, discourage, people, from, hiring, him., He, ranted, about, Canadian, networks, that, refused, to, believe, in, Canadian, shows,, always, trying, to, get, permission, to, stop, funding, them,, even, though, shows, like, Corner, Gas, and, Durham, County, were, successful, and, good., He, was, a, permanent, fixture, in, the, Writer's, Guild, of, Canada,, a, long, time, counsellor, for, Ontario,, and, a, member, of, the, negotiating, committee., I'm, glad, I, was, not, one, of, the, producers, on, the, other, side., He, was, not, afraid, to, call, shenanigans, when, he, saw, them., Like, a, rising, tide,, he, lifted, everyone, around, him., Damn, it,, I, miss, him., 10:56, PM, 5, comments, Post, a, Comment, Sunday,, March, 19,, 2017, Eeyore, Was, Not, Just, Any, Donkey, I'm, playing, a, couple, of, new, games,, and, they, have, amazing, gameplay., But, something's, missing, for, me, with, their, characters., Now,, granted,, you, can, have, a, pretty, good, game, without, strong, characterization., A, game, can, be, superfun, without, it., But, it, can't, make, you, care, about, the, characters., It, can't, move, you., I, have, a, long-running, beef, about, many, fantasy, and, SF, and, historical, games., Characters, are, defined, primarily, by, their, situations., Say,, for, example,, you're, an, outcast., Members, of, the, Tribe, are, mean, to, you., The, character, you, play, is,, naturally,, spunky,, and, doesn't, let, the, meanies, get, her, down., But, suppose, you, were, a, Jew, in, 1930s, Germany,, or, a, Muslim, or, a, trans, person, in, South, Carolina, now., You, do, not, fit, in;, some, people, are, mean, to, you., But, they, are, mean, to, different, degrees, and, in, different, ways., Some, will, mock, you., Some, will, hit, you., Some, will, pretend, you, don't, exist,, because, they're, not, fundamentally, mean, and, they're, embarrassed, about, it., Some, will, be, mean, if, other, people, are, around,, but, nice, to, you, if, other, people, are, not., We, expect, characters, from, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, to, be, people, with, personalities., Their, attitudes, are, colored, by, their, situation;, they're, taught, to, react, to, you, a, certain, way., But, some, people, are, angry, and, just, looking, for, someone, to, take, it, out, on., For, some,, duty, is, important, and, they, might, hurt, you, but, only, because, they, think, they're, supposed, to;, it's, not, personal., People, are, different., I, miss, that, in, a, lot, of, fantasy, and, historical, and, sf, games., I, can't, wait, for, the, cave, man, game, where, you, meet, a, Neanderthal,, and, he's, a, bit, of, a, joker,, but, actually,, you, realize,, actually, kind, of, an, asshole., People, also, have, their, own, stories, going, on., I, can't, wait, till, I'm, playing, a, game, and, I, meet, a, member, of, the, Other, Tribe,, and, she's, really, upset, about, something, that, just, happened, (like, she, just, broke, up, with, her, boyfriend), and, meeting, me, is, not, the, most, important, thing, in, her, day,, I'm, just, a, weird, happenstance., In, A., A., Milne's, Winnie, the, Pooh,, the, animals, are, people., When, you, meet, Eeyore,, he's, a, self-pitying, mope., In, fact,, he, is, such, a, specific, self-pitying, mope, that, I, feel, positive, that,, if, I'd, gone, to, a, garden, party, at, A., A., Milne's, house,, I'd, have, been, able, to, figure, out, which, of, his, friends, A., A., was, making, fun, of., So, if, there, are, three, kids, from, the, Tribe, harassing, the, playing, in, a, prehistoric, or, post-Apocalyptic, game,, then, maybe, one, of, them, is, really, intent, on, hurting, you,, and, obviously, angry, at, your, very, existence., But, a, second, kid, is, trying, to, pull, him, away, because, she, was, enjoying, the, game, they, were, playing, and, you're, nothing, to, her., And, another, is, obvious, upset, at, what, the, first, one, is, doing,, but, doesn't, want, to, rock, the, boat., Just, because, you're, writing, historical, or, pre-historic, characters, doesn't, mean, you, can't, write, people., Modern, homo, sapiens, â, meaning, humans, who, you, could, dress, up, and, put, in, the, subway, and, they'd, look, completely, normal, â, have, been, around, for, at, least, a, hundred, thousand, years., A, hundred, thousand, years, ago, they, probably, believed, the, mountain, was, a, god, and, the, stream, was, a, god, too, and, so, forth., But, don't, tell, me, that, some, of, them, weren't, really, nice, people,, and, some, of, them, were, jerks,, and, some, of, them, you, had, to, catch, on, a, good, day,, and, some, of, them, were, egotistical., Some, of, them, wanted, to, be, chief, of, the, tribe,, and, some, just, wanted, to, get, with, the, ladies, or, the, men,, and, some, were, no, use, for, anything, but, okay, in, a, pinch,, and, some, were, smart, and, clever, and, useless, in, a, fight., And, I, guarantee, you, some, would, not, listen, to, anybody,, and, some, could, make, you, feel, good, when, you, fell, on, your, face,, and, some, just, made, you, feel, stupid,, and, the, kids, didn't, listen, to, their, elders, as, much, as, the, elders, wanted,, because, people, have, been, complaining, about, that, at, least, since, the, invention, of, writing., (Seriously,, we, have, texts, from, the, Romans, and, even, the, ancient, Egyptians, saying,, basically,, "Kids, these, days,, amirite?"), When, you're, writing, aliens,, other, species,, people, from, other, times, and, places,, try, writing, them, like, specific, people, that, you, know., Write, them, so, specifically, that, your, friends, will, recognize, them., Give, them, the, flaws, of, the, people, you're, basing, them, on., And, then,, and, only, then,, put, on, the, pointy, ears., Then, they'll, really, create, a, reality., Then, I'll, really, care., 10:35, PM, 0, comments, Post, a, Comment, Monday,, March, 13,, 2017, Assorted, Questions, Would, you, be, willing, to, read, what, I, have, done, so, far, and,, in, addition,, give, me, some, advice, about, getting, it, in, the, hands, of, a, producer?I, used, to, do, that,, for, a, fee,, but, I, don't, do, that, any, more,, except, for, friends., Certainly,, if, you, assist, me,, I, would, not, mind, at, all, sharing, proceeds, with, you.What, you, are, looking, for, is, an, agent., An, agent, finds, a, producer, to, pay, you,, and, takes, 10%., I, am, working, to, get, the, synopsis, for, my, screenplay, exactly, right., It, took, me, a, month, to, get, the, perfect, log, line., Good!, Most, people, don't, spend, enough, time, on, their, hook., They, just, charge, ahead, and, write, the, script., Then, they, write, the, query, letter., I've, critiqued, query, letters, in, the, past,, for, a, fee,, and, about, half, the, time,, as, I'm, trying, to, improve, the, query,, I, can, easily, think, of, a, better, concept., Of, course, by, then, the, script, is, written, and, nobody, wants, to, rip, up, their, script, and, write, a, better, one., Professionals, do, it, all, the, time., They, don't, want, to,, but, they, do., You, will, see, that, I, am, an, accomplished, writer., In, fact,, my, mantra, is, that, I, steadfastly, refuse, to, start, a, sentence, with, 'the',, a, habit, left, over, from, the, promise, of, at, least, a, grade, of, 75%, in, English, Literature, if, a, student, submitted, material, exclusively, without, ever,

doesn't, speak., As, I, start, Act, II,, I, introduce, an, old, women,, who, is, really, the, cop,, in, makeup, prosthetics, to, look, like, an, old, woman., Do, I, tell, the, reader, that, the, cop, and, the, old, woman, are, one, and, the, same?, Or, do, I, let, the, reader, know, when, everyone, else, finds, out?, A, friend, of, mine, says, âthe, director, and, the, crew, need, to, know, right, away.â, A., They, will,, but, youâre, not, writing, a, shooting, script., Youâre, writing, a, selling, script., A, selling, script, should, read, the, way, you, want, the, audience, to, experience, the, movie., Later, on,, should, your, script, go, into, production,, youâll, make, everything, clear;, but, in, a, selling, script,, secrets, should, remain, secrets, until, theyâre, revealed., You, can,, if, you, want,, write, something, like, âWeâll, see, her, again,â, to, let, us, know, to, pay, attention, to, this, particular, cop;, itâs, the, equivalent, of, the, camera, dwelling, on, this, particular, cop, for, just, long, enough, that, we, know, we, should, remember, her, later., Actually,, why, doesn't, she, speak?, What's, the, point, of, introducing, her, at, all, if, we're, not, going, to, notice, her?, Another, question:, is, she, the, main, character?, If, so,, maybe, we, should, know, she's, in, disguise., If, the, main, character, knows, critical, things, we, don't, know,, it, alienates, us, from, him, or, her., You, can, do, it,, but, we, won't, identify, with, him, or, her, as, much., 1:25, AM, 0, comments, Post, a, Comment, Friday,, March, 03,, 2017, We, Happy, Few, -, Update, -, Meat, Boy, We, have, now,, finally,, at, the, last, minute,, got, everything, recorded, for, this, sprint,, including, at, least, seven, little, old, ladies, for, Hoard, House., Guess, how, many, actors?, Have, a, listen, when, the, update, comes, and, tell, me, how, many, you, think, there, are., As, I, mentioned, last, week,, I, did, a, massive, casting, session, for, a, character, named, Ed, MacMillan,, affectionately, known, around, the, office, as, Meat, Boy., (Obviously, he, is, in, no, way, an, homage, to, anyone, associated, with, the, game, Super, Meat, Boy.), I, found, an, amazing, actor,, Joe, Sims,, who, has, won, all, sorts, of, awards, for, his, radio, work., (I, didnât, know, heâd, won, awards, until, we, cast, him., I, generally, ignore, CVs, when, Iâm, casting, voices., It, takes, much, less, time, to, listen, to, a, voice, reel, and, decide, whether, the, actor, is, inhabiting, the, roles, he, plays.), Joe, will, break, your, heart,, I, hope,, as, Meat, Boy., Heâs, also, assorted, bookies,, bobbies,, lads, and, soldiers., We, had, fun., In, other, news,, affordances., Affordances, is, a, fancy, word, for, âthings, look, like, youâre, supposed, to, use, them, a, certain, way.â, I, read, a, great, book, by, Don, Norman, called, The, Design, of, Everyday, Things., Itâs, about, doors, that, you, canât, figure, out, whether, to, push, or, pull, on, them,, and, how, to, design, things, so, theyâre, intuitive., Itâs, actually, super, helpful, for, game, design., You, might, dig, it., Well,, we, put, some, phone, booths, in, the, game,, because,, you, know,, iconic., Canât, have, Britain, without, red, telephone, boxes., But, then, you, guys, said,, âWe, want, to, pick, up, the, phones, and, hear, something.â, So, we, put, some, voices, on, the, phone., And, a, baseball, game, between, the, Dublin, Dukes, and, the, New, York, Yankees., But, then, you, guys, said,, âThereâs, voices,, but, thereâs, no, gameplay.â, Gosh,, you, people, are, demanding., So, Lisa, and, I, came, up, with, a, story, and, some, gameplay, for, the, phone, booths., It, wonât, be, in, this, update,, but, maybe, it, will, be, in, the, next., So, I, hope, yâall, feel, the, love., Labels:, We, Happy, Few, 2:36, PM, 0, comments, Post, a, Comment, Friday,, February, 24,, 2017, We, Happy, Few, Update, -, Casting, Challenges, I, was, not, satisfied, with, what, we, were, able, to, do, with, one, particular, character, in, a, recording, session, with, an, otherwise, wonderful, voice, actor., Our, voice, actor, is, very, good, at, accents,, but, this, is, a, fairly, hard, role, â, a, developmentally, disabled, adult, who, has, to, break, your, heart., So, I, fired, off, a, casting, call, to, the, UK., Saying, âdevelopmentally, disabled, characterâ, to, the, entire, pool, of, agents, in, the, UK, is, a, little, bit, of, waving, a, red, flag, in, front, of, the, Running, of, the, Bulls., Playing, disabled, is, an, artistic, challenge,, so, it, shows, your, acting, chops., The, clip, will, almost, certainly, go, on, your, reel., I, got, 80, submissions, in, about, three, hours, late, on, a, Thursday, afternoon., So, I, got, to, wade, through, 80, submissions., One, weird, thing, about, voice, character, submissions, is, the, headshots., They, send, me, headshots., Why, would, I, care, about, headshots?, I, donât, care, what, the, actor, looks, like., All, right,, itâs, nice, that, Alex, Wyndham, could, actually, pass, for, Arthur, if, we, did, the, movie,, but, he, could, look, like, Shirley, Temple, for, all, I, care., When, we, do, the, recording, sessions,, we, donât, have, the, camera, on,, so, I, literally, do, not, know, what, half, of, my, actors, look, like., I, winnow, those, 80, submissions, to, 9, Iâd, like, to, hear, from;, plus, I, go, through, my, last, casting, call, and, ping, the, agents, whose, clients, were, great, but, not, right, for, those, roles., The, actors, will, record, an, MP3,, and, a, dozen, actors, will, come, down, to, three, or, four., Iâll, audition, those, guys, on, the, phone., The, lucky, actor, â, by, âluckyâ, I, mean, âprobably, spent, a, decade, or, two, painstakingly, learning, how, to, turn, his, talent, into, craftâ, â, then, gets, to, record, this, one, particular, part, for, about, fifteen, minutes,, plus, a, bunch, of, other, stuff, for, forty-five, minutes., And, the, scene, will, play, for, about, a, minute, and, a, half, in, the, game., It, is, a, ridiculous, amount, of, work, for, a, role, youâre, going, to, see, on, screen, in, the, first, playthrough, for, 90, seconds., This, is, why, recording, voice, actors, is, expensive, even, for, short, recordings, -, youâre, not, paying, for, 15, minutes, of, work,, youâre, paying, for, the, lifetime, of, experience, that, is, needed, to, deliver, a, great, 15, minutes, of, work., But, if, those, two, minutes, break, your, heart,, then, they, add, meaning, to, the, hour, or, two, of, gameplay, following, that, encounter., They, show, us, a, side, of, Arthur, we, wouldnât, know, without, them., So, you, care., I, mean,, thatâs, the, point, of, the, narrative,, after, all:, to, make, you, care., So, thatâs, why, I, was, up, till, midnight, on, a, Thursday., The, rest, of,

Inktip., One, producer, contacted, me, to, ask, if, I, would, add, an, angel, to, to, script,, turn, it, into, a, feature, film, script, and, then, tone, it, down, to, family, friendly., I, asked, if, we, could, chat, by, phone., We, had, a, good, rapport, and, I, enjoyed, hearing, her, ideas., I, developed, a, new, synopsis,, tweaked, it, after, several, email, exchanges, until, she, said, that, she, loved, it., I, waited, a, few, days., Then, I, emailed, to, ask, what, she, would, like, to, do, next., I, had, asked, her, about, her, budget, earlier, and, she, didn't, want, to, discuss,

haven't, added, those, changes, to, the, script, because, the, changes, are, major,, would, certainly, surprise, the, readers, who, followed, the, book, series,, and, I'm, not, sure, I, want, to, write, a, screenplay, with, no, budget, in, mind., I've, never, worked, gratis., Should, I, write, a, screenplay, for, her, without, knowing, the, budget,, or, if, she, has, the, funds, to, pay, me?That, would, be, "no.", She, has,, at, this, point,, read, a, script,, made, notes,, and, read, a, synopsis., She's, invested,, at, most,, two, hours, in, your, project., You've, probably, invested, several, days, to, a, week., It, costs, nothing, for, a, producer, to, say,, "Hey,, this, would, be, great, if, it, were, set, in, a, PT, boat, in, the, South, Pacific, in, 1943.", It, costs, you, time, to, rewrite., At, the, end, of, all, that, time,, the, producer, can, say,, "Y'know, what..., never, mind.", You're, stuck, with, a, version, of, your, script, that, you, don't, necessarily, believe, in., If, someone, gives, you, notes, that, make, your, script, better,, there's, nothing, wrong, with, taking, those, notes., Even, if, the, producer, doesn't, want, the, script, afterwards,, you, still, have, a, better, script., "Put, not, your, trust, in, princes,", as, the, Bible, says., Assume, that, some, portion, of, whatever, a, producer, says, is, optimism,, and,

the, right, place., Last, night, I, suggested, she, think, about, "what, is, your, hero's, greatest, fear?, The, action, sequence, is, where, she, confronts, and, surmounts, it.", She, sort, of, lit, up, and, disappeared, into, her, writer's, brain,, and, this, morning, told, me,, "I've, got, the, whole, thing.", It's, not, about, the, monkeys., It's, never, about, the, monkeys., A, great, third,

Death, Star, is, not, really, about, where, the, X-wings, go., It, is, about, Luke, surrendering, to, the, Force, and, taking, the, path, to, becoming, a, Jedi, like, his, father., There, are, plenty, of, movies, where, the, third, act, action, sequence, is, not, about, the, hero, achieving, his, or, her, destiny,, or, completing, his, or, her, journey., The, action, is, about, the, hero, accomplishing, his, external, goal., However,, they, are, less, satisfying,, I, find,, than, movies, in, which, the, action, sequence, is, not, only, the, physical, resolution,, but, the, dramatic, resolution., What, does, your, hero, have, to, do, in, order, to, complete, his, or, her, journey?, Actually,, this, is, true, of, all, action, sequences,, in, the, broadest, sense., A, sex, scene, should, never, be, about, the, sex, (unless, you're, writing, a, porno,, obviously)., A, sex, scene, should, be, a, dialog, scene, without, words,, where, the, characters, are, using, sex, to,

realize, this., The, reason, I, have, this, particular, tool, in, my, writer's, toolkit, is, that, John, Rogers, wrote, about, this, in, some, detail, a, dozen, years, ago., He, phrases, it, like, this:, Don't, write, action, scenes., Write, suspense, scenes, that, require, action, to, resolve., That, is, excellent, advice, any, time,, but, particularly, excellent, advice, for, your, finale.,

changing, the, timing, of, the, scene, â, I, try, to, make, the, new, words, fit, as, closely, as, possible, to, where, the, old, words, lived,, or, at, least, take, up, the, same, amount, of, time,, so, I, donât, bump, other, lines, that, are, still, working., Shouldnât, we, have, made, these, changes, before, the, animators, went, to, work?, Sure., But, itâs, very, hard, to, read,

character,, then, I, pretty, much, have, to, tell, a, science, fiction, story., So, if, you, make, a, bunch, of, decisions, on, the, easy, stuff,, you're, restricting, your, range, of, choices, for, the, hard, stuff., That's, bass, ackwards., You, want, as, much, room, as, possible, when, you're, doing, the, hard, stuff,, since, you, can, probably, handle, a, restricted, range, of, choices, on, the, easy, stuff., In, other, words,, don't, paint, yourself, into, a, corner, on, the, easy, stuff., What, happens, if, you, do, paint, yourself, into, a, corner, on, the, easy, stuff, is, either, (a), you, accept, a, poor, solution, on, the, hard, stuff,, because, you, don't, see, any, good, way, to, do, it;, or, (b), you, rip, up, a, bunch, of, stuff, that, was, working,, because, otherwise, you, can't, make, the, hard, stuff, work., In, game, development,, if, your, game, hangs, on, a, fresh, new, gameplay, mechanic,, then, try, to, get, that, working, before, you, put, any, environments, into, the, game., Spearhead,, for, example,, created, a, three-on-three, science, fiction, soccer, game., The, first, playable, build, was, pretty, much, dots, chasing, another, dot, around, a, grey, box;, but, the, fun, was, already, there., In, screenplay, writing,, if, you're, weak, on, characters,, then, consider, writing, only, the, faintest, of, sketchiest, of, plot, outlines,, and, then, really, spending, some, time, thinking, about, what, characters, could, most, interestingly, inhabit, that, plot, â, as, opposed, to, working, out, a, really, detailed, plot, and, then, trying, to, shoehorn, some, characters, into, it., Or,, if, you're, good, on, characters, but, weak, on, plot,, take, some, relatively, simple, characters,, and, build, a, fairly, detailed,, surprising-yet-inevitable, plot, around, them, before, you, move, to, fleshing, them, out., You, get, several, benefits, from, this., One,, you, develop, your, creative, muscles., If, you, are, good, at, situps, but, bad, at, pushups,, and, you, do, a, bunch, of, pushups,, you, will, have, stronger, biceps,, and, now, you, can, do, both, pushups, and, situps., Two,, your, creative, project, is, strong, both, in, the, area, you, find, hard, and, the, area, you, find, easy,, instead, of, just, in, the, area, you, find, easy., Three,, when, you're, working, on, stuff, that, scares, you,, you, will, often, make, more, interesting, choices, than, you, would, if, you, were, working, on, stuff, you, understand, well., Creativity, is, usually, a, dance, between, structure, and, improvisation., If, you, force, yourself, to, improvise,, you'll, come, up, with, stuff, you, might, not, otherwise, have, thought, of., Four,, if, you, work, on, the, hard, stuff, first,, and, utterly, fail,, you, haven't, wasted, any, time, on, the, easy, stuff., The, finicky, AI, tech, never, really, worked,, and, the, studio, was, left, with, a, whole, bunch, of, bespoke, environments, and, animations., If, you, really, hate, writing, a, character, based, screenplay,, then, after, you've, banged, some, characters, around, for, a, few, weeks,, you, might, just, toss, the, project, and, go, write, some, hook-driven, action, thriller, where, you, can, get, away, with, snappy, banter, in, the, place, of, actual, characterization., If, you, really, cannot, write, an, interesting, plot,, then, you'll, find, that, out, when, you, attempt, to, plot, out, your, suspense, thriller,, and, you, can, chuck, it, and, go, write, that, achingly, personal, coming, of, age, story., So:, work, on, the, part, that, scares, you, first!, 2:55, PM, 1, comments, Post, a, Comment, Wednesday,, November, 30,, 2016, What, should, I, ask, for?, Q., I, just, picked, up, my, first, "LA", option, for, a, short, story, I, wrote., I'll, be, getting, 2%, net, if, it, gets, made., Now, I've, read, articles, on, net, versus, gross, in, the, industry, and, my, agent, ways, I, should, just, be, happy, at, this, stage, of, my, career, that, it, was, picked, up......, so, of, course, I, signed., However, as, a, writer, moving, forward, is, there, anything, else, I, should, be, aware, of, or, ask, for, that, doesn't, normally, fall, within, the, option, contract?, The, standard, definition, of, net, profits, is, "you, don't, see, any, profits.", So, whether, you, get, 2%, of, nothing, or, 5%, of, nothing, is, unimportant., On, the, other, hand, as, a, newbie, you're, not, going, to, get, gross., It's, pretty, rare, for, even, a, veteran, writer, to, get, gross, participation., If, the, movie, is, a, hit,, you, won't, get, more, cash, from, the, movie,, but, you, will, get, asked, to, write, other, people's, movies, at, a, much, better, salary., I, like, to, ask, for, the, right, of, first, refusal, (ROFR), to, write, sequels,, prequels, and, spin-offs,, as, well, as, TV, pilots., Sometimes, that, turns, into, ROFR, provided, thatÂ I, get, a, credit, on, the, script., (No, one, can, guarantee, I, get, a, credit, because, it's, arbitrated, by, the, Guild.), If, they're, optioning, your, story, or, novel,, you, can, often, ask, for, ROFR, to, write, the, initial, script., Very, likely, they, will, take, it, away, from, you, after, the, first, draft,, but, you'll, get, a, screenwriting, credit, on, the, movie, because, when, you, adapted, the, script, you, brought, in, the, plot, and, the, characters., If, you, don't, write, the, first, draft,, the, most, you'd, get, would, be, a, "Based, on, a, short, story, by", credit., When, I'm, optioning, a, script,, I, like, to, ask, for, a, production, bonus, based, on, the, budget, of, the, film., The, WGC,, but, not, the, WGA,, has, this, in, the, standard, contract., Bear, in, mind, the, minimum, scale, percentage, is, a, floor,, not, a, cap,, so, you, can, negotiate, more,, if, they, really, want, the, script., The, nice, thing, about, a, percentage, is, that, the, producer, can't, really, plead, poverty., "But, our, budget, is, tiny.", "No, problem,, then, I, get, 2.5%, of, tiny.", Bear, in, mind, anything, that, looks, like, "Writer, will, be, consulted", bla, bla, bla, is, meaningless, and, unenforceable., "What, do, you, think.", "It, sucks, because, this, this, and, this.", "Thanks,, you've, been, consulted.", Likewise, anything, that, looks, like, "Writer, will, be, considered.", "What, do, you, think, about, Joe?", "That, guy?, F*&&, him.", You've, been, considered., Remember,, you, can, insist, on, any, contractual, term,, so, long, as, you're, willing, to, walk, away., I've, heard, that, Sylvester, Stallone, turned, down, $200,000, for, the, script, to, Rocky,, because, they, wouldn't, agree, for, him, to, star, in, it., He, was, broke, at, the, time., Later,, someone, else, bought, the, script, for, scale,, but, with, him, to, star, in, it., You, could, probably, tell, that, story, about, a, thousand, other, guys, who, never, sold, their, script, to, anyone, because, they, insisted, on, starring, in, it., By, the, same, token,, if, you're, not, willing, to, walk, away,, it's, hard, to, get, anything., You, don't, get, the, contract, you, deserve,, you, get, the, contract, you, negotiate., 99%, of, the, time, it's, better, to, have, an, agent, negotiate, for, you., But, you, don't, want, to, leave, the, negotiating, to, the, agent., You, want, them, to, be, the, face, of, the, negotiation,, but, ultimately, you, have, to, tell, them, what, your, dealbreakers, are, and, how, hard, to, haggle,, and, how, upset, you'll, be, if, they, don't, make, a, deal., Labels:, contracts, 1:58, PM, 0, comments, Post, a, Comment, Saturday,, November, 26,, 2016, Clams., Don't, use, them., As, a, public, service,, here, are, the, two, boards, from, the,

AM, 0, comments, Post, a, Comment, Friday,, November, 25,, 2016, It's, Never, "Just", a, Joke, We, had, an, interesting, office, conversation, today,, about, the, late, comedian/troll, Andy, Kaufman,, which, then, drifted, into, whether, sexist, and, racist, jokes, are, okay., I, don't, appreciate, them., One, of, the, women, in, the, office, said, she, enjoys, them, because, "it's, just, a, joke.", But, why, do, we, tell, jokes?, Jokes, are, meant, to, make, us, uncomfortable, in, some, way., We, laugh, when, something, goes, wrong., A, joke, is, always, a, setup, that, is, derailed., There, are, absurdist, jokes,, of, course,, that, are, just, all, about, the, derail:, "I, went, to, a, restaurant, that, serves, 'breakfast, anytime.', So, I, asked, for, French, toast, in, the, Renaissance.", --, Stephen, Wright, Our, expectations, are, foiled,, and, we, laugh, out, of, the, cognitive, dissonance., But, most, jokes, are, at, someone's, expense., "Tragedy,", as, Mel, Brooks, said,, "is, I, stub, my, toe., Comedy, is, you, die.", For, example:, My, lover's, been, bugging, me, for, the, key, to, my, apartmentâ¦, finally, I, said,, 'No,, I'll, let, you, out, when, I'm, ready.', --, Heidi, Foss, To, dissect, my, friend, Heidi's, joke, a, bit,, the, setup, is, the, assumed, attempt, on, the, part, of, the, lover, to, have, a, closer, relationship., The, derail, is, that, the, lover, is, actually, imprisoned., Note, that, the, joke, works, because, it's, sort, of, horrifying., ("When, I'm, ready", is, a, nice, touch, because, it, mirrors, the, normal, conversation:, 'I'm, not, ready', for, a, closer, relationship.), Stereotype, jokes, are, at, the, expense, of, a, whole, group, of, people:, Q., How, many, Harvard, students, does, it, take, to, screw, in, a, lightbulb?, A., Just, one., He, stands, on, the, ladder,, and, the, whole, world, revolves, around, him., The, point, of, the, joke, is, that, Harvard, students, are, conceited., Here's, another:, Two, blondes, were, talking., "Last, year,", one, said,, "I, slept, with, two, Brazilian, guys.", "Oh, my, God!", said, the, other., "How, many, is, a, 'brazilian'"?, The, point, of, the, joke, is, that, blonde, women, are, stupid., Oh,, and, slutty., So, why, do, I, think, it's, not, okay, to, tell, racist, or, sexist, jokes?, Because, the, point, of, a, joke, about, a, stereotype, is, that, it's, only, funny, if, the, listener, believes, that, the, stereotype, is,, in, some, way,, true., Change, one, word, in, the, joke:, Q., How, many, Columbia, students, does, it, take, to, screw, in, a, lightbulb?, A., Just, one., He, stands, on, the, ladder,, and, the, whole, world, revolves, around, him., That, joke, isn't, funny,, because, almost, no, one, thinks, that, Columbia, students, are, particularly, conceited., Two, Canadians, were, talking., "Last, year,", one, said,, "I, slept, with, two, Brazilian, guys.", "Oh, my, God!", said, the, other., "How, many, is, a, 'brazilian'"?, What?, Huh?, Not, funny., No, one, thinks, Canadians, are, particularly, dumb., Now,, jokes, at, the, expense, of, Harvard, students, aren't, particularly, awful., Harvard, students, are, on, top, of, the, academic, heap., So, the, joke, is, sort, of, "telling, truth, to, power.", But, jokes, at, the, expense, of, blondes, are, not, completely, innocent., If, I, tell, a, blonde, joke,, I'm, saying, that,, to, some, extent,, the, intelligence, of, women, with, blonde, hair, is, suspect., "But, it's, just, a, joke.", Well,, nothing, is, "just", a, joke., If, people, didn't, already, suspect, blondes, of, being, dumb,, the, joke, wouldn't, land., Now,, there, are, stereotypes, that, are, hurtful,, and, stereotypes, nobody, really, minds:, Q., How, many, New, Yorkers, does, it, take, to, screw, in, a, lightbulb?, A., None, of, your, fucking, business!, Most, New, Yorkers, will, laugh, at, that, joke,, because, they'd, agree, that, New, Yorkers, are, brusque., Q., How, many, Zen, Buddhists, does, it, take, to, screw, in, a, lighbulb., A., Three., What?, Oh., Zen, Buddhists, are, inscrutable., Right., But, then, we, get, into, jokes, based, on, not, so, innocent, stereotypes., For, example,, jokes, about, how, stingy, [Hittites], are., [Hittites], don't, find, them, funny,, because, they, don't, see, themselves, in, them., And,, the, stereotype, of, [Hittites], as, being, stingy, is, part, of, a, whole, package, of, anti-Semitism, that,, in, the, middle, of, the, last, century,, ended, up, in, homicidal, violence., Similarly,, jokes, about, how, lazy, [Sumerians], are,, or, how, dishonest, [Assyrians], are,, are, part, of, a, whole, package, of, racism, that, ends, up, with, unarmed, [Sumerians], being, shot, by, cops,, and, candidates, accusing, [Assyrians], of, being, rapists, and, murderers, that, should, be, kept, out, of, the, country., The, point, is:, when, you, tell, a, joke, based, on, a, nasty, stereotype,, you, are, saying, the, stereotype, is,, in, some, way,, true., Nothing, is, ever, "just", a, joke., By, making, a, joke,, the, teller, is, saying, that, the, stereotype, is, in, some, way, true., And, by, laughing, at, it,, you, are, agreeing., In, fact,, the, whole, reason, for, these, jokes, is, so, that, the, teller, can, put, down, a, group, of, people, and, get, away, with, it;, and, the, listener, can, buy, into, the, putdown, and, get, away, with, it., But, in, this, case, somebody's, not, telling, truth, to, power;, they're, telling, lies,, and, they're, punching, down., Of, course,, it's, impossible, to, dissect, racist, or, sexist, humor, without, sounding, terribly, unfunny,, like, you, "don't, get, the, joke":, Q., How, many, militant, feminists, does, it, take, to, screw, in, a, lightbulb?, A., THAT'S, NOT, FUNNY., But, jokes, have, power., We, wouldn't, tell, jokes, if, they, didn't., Jokes, are, how, we, allow, ourselves, to, communicate, truths, that, can't, be, communicated, openly., That's, why, traditionally, the, court, jester, is, the, only, person, who's, allowed, to, confront, the, King;, he's, allowed, that, privilege, because, his, jokes, are, deniable., That's, why,, in, dictatorships,, you, can, go, to, prison, for, telling, a, joke, at, the, expense, of, the, dictator., That's, why, some, cartoons, making, fun, of, Mohammed, triggered, riots., Jokes, based, on, false, stereotypes, have, the, parallel, power, that, they, can, communicate, a, lie, that, no, one, dares, communicate, openly, any, more., The, reason, some, white, people, tell, jokes, about, lazy, [Sumerians], is, because, they, don't, dare, say, things, like,, "Well,, everyone, knows, how, lazy, [Sumerians], are.", But, turn, it, into, a, joke,, and, "it's, just, a, joke,", and, you, get, away, with, it., And, they, are, all, the, more, hurtful, because, the, target, is, supposed, to, laugh, them, off., So, the, target, has, no, recourse,, unless, they're, witty, enough, to, craft, a, good, comeback., And, that's, why, it's, never, "just", a, joke., 7:38, PM, 4, comments, Post, a, Comment, Wednesday,, November, 16,, 2016, Some, Quick, and, Dirty, Thoughts, about, Richard, Rouse, III..., ...'s, talk, about, Dynamic, Stories, at, MIGS., These, are, my, notes, as, I, wrote, them, up, for, my, Compulsion, Games, teammates..., The, complete, powerpoint, is,

boring, if, all, the, streams, are, of, the, same, stuff., Types, of, dynamic, story:, a., Explorable, story, space, What, weâre, doing, in, WHF, and, what, most, AAA, games, do, these, days:, bits, of, narrative, that, you, discover, wandering, around., Hopefully, thereâs, enough, that, few, players, discover, all, of, it., Doesnât, have, to, mean, environmental, narrative., Her, Story, allows, you, discover, bits, of, video, through, a, text, parser., You, never, actually, go, anywhere., b., Open, ended, story, Give, the, player, enough, bits, of, a, story, that, s/he, can, find, his/her, own, meaning, in, it,, but, not, so, much, that, you, force, the, player, into, your, interpretation., One, player, may, come, away, with, a, very, different, experience, than, another., c.,

really, itâs, just, one, choice, repeated:, Mass, Effect's, Paragon/Renegade., Bioshock's, Harvest/Rescue., Or,, choices,, but, only, some, of, which, change, the, story,, and, then, only, change, a, little, bit, of, the, story:, Walking, Dead., d., Shifting, story, elements, Procedurally, generated, story., In, Richardâs, game,, The, Church, in, the, Darkness,, you, are, there, to, rescue, someone, from, a, cult., Sometimes, the, cult, is, a, suicide, Jim-Jones-style, cult., However,, sometimes,, itâs, just, a, bunch, of, hippies, who, want, to, be, left, alone., The, Blade, Runner, game, changed, who, was, a, replicant, from, playthrough, to, playthrough., In, both, examples,, the, payoff, is, you, Actually, Have, to, Pay, Attention, to, the, story, around, you., If, it, turns, out, that, in, the, story, they're, just, nice, hippies,, or, humans,, you're, not, supposed, to, go, shooting, them., e., Character, Simulation, The, Sims., The, Civilization, franchise., Characters, have, personalities, and, react, to, your, actions, according, to, them., Faction-based, systems:, characters, will, react, differently, to, your, dwarf, rogue, depending, on, how, they, feel, about, dwarves, and/or, rogues,, and, how, nice, youâve, been, to, their, friends., The, player, here, is, choosing, what, story, s/he, wants, to, be, part, of., f., Drama, Management, Here, Richardâs, talking, about, games, like, FaÃ§ade, that, try, to, make, a, story, out, of, whatever, it, is, you, are, doing., Shadow, of, Mordorâs, nemesis, system, turns, an, NPC, into, your, nemesis, if, heâs, killed, you, before., Wot, I, Thought, The, Holy, Grail, of, game, narrative, is, emergent, narrative., Emergent, gameplay, is, when, you, design, systems, the, players, can, use, in, ways, the, developers, did, not, plan, for,, e.g., rocket, jumping., Most, of, the, dynamic, storytelling, methods, listed, are, not, emergent., The, Shadow, of, Mordor, people, like, to, claim, that, SoMâs, nemesis, stories, are, emergent,, but, someone, had, to, write, and, record, all, the, nasty, things, the, orcs, say, to, you, when, you, come, back, from, the, dead,, or, they, do., On, Stories:, TpoD, I, pitched, the, idea, of, a, sort, of, Collectible, Card, Game, or, faction-based, narrative., I.e., NPCs, have, a, basic, reaction, to, you,, which, changes, according, to, what, you, do, with, other, NPCs., So, if, you, kill, someoneâs, brother,, they, will, no, longer, sell, you, a, sword,, but, they, might, fight, you., If, you, marry, their, brother,, they, might, tell, you, where, some, loot, is., This, is, not, emergent, narrative,, either., It, feels, more, like, it,, because, you, discover, the, story, branches, according, to, your, own, wanderings, through, the, game., But, someone, has, to, write, each, branch, of, each, NPCâs, story, tree., (In, the, end, we, just, went, with, a, straight, ahead, story, tree, for, Stories:, TpoD., Nothing, wrong, with, a, story, tree,, theyâre, just, hard, to, write, so, every, path, feels, like, a, good, story,, in, which, the, seeds, of, the, ending, are, in, the, beginning., And, theyâre, a, lot, of, work.), To, make, really, emergent, narrative,, youâd, have, to, create, narrative, building, blocks, that, players, can, arrange, in, different, ways., Say, you, have, one, building, block:, dudeâs, getting, a, divorce., Second, building, block:, dudeâs, sleeping, with, someone, whoâs, not, his, wife., Both, of, these, are, narratively, fraught, events,, but, they, have, a, different, meaning,, and, tell, a, different, story, depending, on, their, arrangement., If, you, see:, dude, sleeping, around, ->, getting, a, divorce, Then, the, player, probably, interpolates, the, story, âhe, cheated,, so, his, spouse, is, dumping, him.â, But, if, you, see:, dude, getting, a, divorce, ->, sleeps, around, Then, you, might, interpolate,, âfinally, free, of, his, toxic, marriage,, dude, is, seeing, other, people.â, This, method, is, probably, hella, difficult, to, pull, off,, and, Iâm, not, sure, Iâd, want, to, do, it, in, a, game., But, then:, Q., Knock, knock., A., Whoâs, there?, Q., Control, freak., Now, you, say,, âControl, freak, who?â, So, there, you, have, it., Weâre, doing, a, lot, of, environmental, narrative,, and, some, open, ended, story, telling,, but, the, other, techniques, will, have, to, wait, for, some, future, game., 5:43, PM, 0, comments, Post, a, Comment, Monday,, November, 07,, 2016, We, Happy, Few, Update, -, Trumpocalypse, Edition, What, I, did, in,

This, week, I, wrote, it, up,, and, Iâve, started, in, on, the, scenes,, including, one, with, our, Hammer, [Films], Villain., Thereâs, a, fair, amount, of, carnage;, weâll, have, to, redo, some, minutes, of, animation., But, the, story, will, be, better, for, it, â, more, jeopardy,, and, more, aligning, of, player, objective, with, player, character, objective., Also, did, the, same, for, our, Mad, Scotsman,, although, his, story, is, holding, up, a, bit, better., We, can, probably, keep, most, of, our, animation,, but, some, of, the, dialog, in, those, cutscenes, will, change., Meanwhile,, Lisa, is, creating, gobs, of, environmental, narrative, for, all, sorts, of, places., Environmental, narrative, comprises, the, letters, and, diaries, and, signs, and, objects, that, you, might, find, here, and, there, that, tells, you, what, has, been, happening, in, the, place, you're, lurking, about., It, creates, the, worldiness, of, the, world., All, of, which, means, more,

needed, eleven, lines, from, our, Mad, Scotsman, for, some, revisions, weâre, making, to, a, scene, in, the, Train, Station., But, an, actorâs, minimum, call, is, an, hour., So, Iâve, been, writing, barks, for, him, â, 225, of, them., That, should, round, out, the, hour,, eh?, Iâve, been, working, on, rethinking, the, playthrough, for, She, Who, Must, Not, Be, Named., G, had, an, issue, that, she, did, not, seem, to, be, in, enough, jeopardy;, and, that, the, player, characterâs, motivations, didnât, line, up, enough, with, the, playerâs, own, motivations., So, Iâve, been, reworking, the, story, logic, and, the, characters, involved., This, will, involved, a, fair, amount, of, carnage, â, animations, we, have, to, throw, out, â, but, it, will, result, in, a, more, powerful, story, and, better, integration, between, gameplay, and, story., And,, Iâve, done, a, pass, on, the, journal, text., You, are, reading, your, journal,, right?, Rest, of, the, team, posted, here..., Labels:, We, Happy, Few, 9:44, PM, 0, comments, Post, a, Comment, Learning, to, write, stylish, English?, Read, Raymond, Chandler., I, used, to, teach, the, English, side, of, the, SAT, for, the, Princeton, Review,, an, SAT, prep, company., I, had, the, advanced, class,, which, was, about, 50%, Korean, immigrants, who, were, still, learning, idiomatic, English., I, told, them, the, best, thing, they, could, do, to, improve, their, English, was, read, Raymond, Chandler., He's, the, guy, who, wrote, The, Big, Sleep, and, Farewell,, My, Lovely., You, know,, the, Humphrey, Bogart, movies., (Or,, at, least,, the, movies, I, remember, as, starring, Humphrey, Bogart,, even, when, it, was, actually, Robert, Mitchum.), See,, you, don't, need, great, literature, to, learn, English., In, fact, it's, not, idea., First,, great, literature, is, taxing, on, your, brain., Second, and, more, importantly,, it's, all, about, nuance., When, you, don't, already, know, the, nuances,, you're, apt, to, muddy, your, learning., What, you, need, is, stylish, writing., Â Raymond, Chandler, had, style, to, burn:, "It, was, a, blonde., A, blonde, to, make, a, bishop, kick, a, hole, in, a, stained-glass, window.", "The, girl, gave, him, a, look, which, ought, to, have, stuck, at, least, four, inches, out, of, his, back.", "There, was, a, desert, wind, blowing, that, night., It, was, one, of, those, hot, dry, Santa, Anas, that, come, down, through, the, mountain, passes, and, curl, your, hair, and, make, your, nerves, jump, and, your, skin, itch., On, nights, like, that, every, booze, party, ends, in, a, fight., Meek, little, wives, feel, the, edge, of, the, carving, knife, and, study, their, husbands', necks., Anything, can, happen., You, can, even, get, a, full, glass, of, beer, at, a, cocktail, lounge.", "She, lowered, her, lashes, until, they, almost, cuddled, her, cheeks, and, slowly, raised, them, again,, like, a, theatre, curtain., I, was, to, get, to, know, that, trick., That, was, supposed, to, make, me, roll, over, on, my, back, with, all, four, paws, in, the, air.", âIn, writing, a, novel,, when, in, doubt,, have, two, guys, come, through, the, door, with, guns.â, That, last, one, is, indeed, his, plotting, style., Don't, read, Chandler, for, an, airtight, plot., Read, Chandler, for, how, to, turn, short, old, words, into, magic;, for, how, to, give, your, sentences, rhythms, that, have, the, sway, and, slash, of, poetry, without, reminding, you, that, you're, reading, words, on, a, page., Read, Chandler, because, his, books, are, very, hard, to, put, down., 2:24, PM, 1, comments, Post, a, Comment, Tuesday,, October, 18,, 2016, A, Brief, Note, about, Story, in, Deus, Ex:, Mankind, Divided, I'm, enjoying, Deus, Ex, as, a, series, of, stealth, puzzles., The, story, raises, some, points, about, craft, that, I'm, working, on, myself., The, world, is, one, in, which, "augs", such, as, Adam, Jensen,, our, gravel-voiced, hero,, are, discriminated, against, after, a, worldwide, accident, caused, many, of, them, to, go, haywire., There, is, terrorism, by, augs,, unless, it, is, by, provocateurs, seeking, to, blame, augs., There's, political, infighting, within, Jensen's, organization,, TF29,, and, Jensen, is, also, involved,, you, quickly, learn,, with, an, aug, organization, that, suspects, TF29, is, being, used, against, augs., There, are, global, stakes., Jensen, seeks, justice, against, terrorists,, and, truth, against, plotters., Now, I'm, only, about, 20, hours, in,, and, I'm, a, bit, of, a, completionist,, so, I'm, not, to, Golem, City, yet., But, what, I, would, love, to, see, more, of, isÂ personalÂ stakes., What, does, all, this, mean, to, Jensen?, You, get, to, choose, what, Jensen, says, about, all, this,, so, he, doesn't, really, have, his, own, a, point, of, view., It's, received, wisdom, in, a, Hollywood, action, movie, that, the, hero, should, have, global, stakes, andÂ personal, stakes., John, McClane, is, trying, to, save, a, towerful, of, hostages,, including, his, ex-wife., Why?, Because, we, can't, relate, to, a, towerful, of, hostages., Â "One, death, is, a, tragedy., A, million, is, a, statistic,", as, Stalin, said., That's, why, King, Kong, has, to, have, Fay, Wray, in, his, hand., She's, there, to, give, Kong, a, personal, goal,, without, which, he's, just, an, ape, run, amok., A, story, needs, jeopardy, or, stakes., You'd, think, you, have, jeopardy, in, a, video, game,, because, the, hero, can, get, killed,, but, after, the, 37th, time, you, reboot, him,, it, stops, feeling, like, real, jeopardy., So, you, need, stakes., And, global, stakes, don't, create, emotional, engagement, by, themselves., I, mean,, did, you, sob, with, relief, when, your, Captain, Shepherd, saved, all, sentient, life, from, the, Reapers?, I, bet, you, had, more, emotional, connection, when, Joel, in, The, Last, of, Us, did, that, thing, that, he, did, at, the, end, --, because, it, involved, his, relationship, with, one, person., Heroes, have, girlfriends, (or, boyfriends,, or, wards,, or, moms), to, humanize, them;, it's, the, same, reason, that, heroes, with, flaws, are, more, engaging., We'd, care, about, Peter, Parker, less, if, Mary, Jane, weren't, in, danger., Fighting, crime, is, abstract;, saving, the, girl, he, loves, is, personal., I'm, not, saying, Adam, needs, a, girlfriend, (or, a, boyfriend,, or, a, ward,, or, a, mom)., But, if, the, global, stakes, were, tied, up, in, personal, stakes,, I, feel, the, emotional, engagement, would, be, stronger., E.g.,, rather, than, having, him, investigate, a, bombing,, have, him, investigate, a, bombing, that, put, his, best, friend, in, a, coma., Rather, than, have, him, prove, that, an, aug, organization, didn't, commit, a, terrorist, act,, have, him, prove, that, an, aug, organization, of, which, his, ex, girlfriend, is, a, memberÂ did, not, commit, a, terrorist, act, and, therefore, she, should, not, be, executed.Â (Or, his, boyfriend,, or, his, ward,, or, his, mom.), Or,, maybe, his, girlfriend,, or, boyfriend,, or, mom,, has, turned, against, him, because, they, think, augs, are, terrorists., Or, they, think, augs, are, terrorists, and, should, all, be, locked, up, except, for, Adam, and, one, or, two, "good, augs.", Or, a, judge, is, going, to, take, away, his, kid, because, he, thinks, augs, are, terrorists., Ha, ha,, I, know,, Adam, Jensen, would, never, have, a, kid., (But, what, if, he, did?, And, he, had, to, choose, whether, to, make, his, kid, an, aug,, or, let, his, kid, stay, in, a, wheelchair?), (There, are, in, fact, side, quests, which, create, some, personal, stakes;, but, they're, missions, he, does, for, people, he, runs, into,, mostly,, not, people, who, are, necessarily, part, of, his, life., If, he, fails, these, people,, he, doesn't, lose, anything.), Look,, I'm, painting, in, very, broad, strokes, here., There, are, much, more, surprising,, provocative, and, challenging, ways, to, make, global, stakes, personal., I'm, just, using, these, as, examples., I, also, tend, to, think,, by, the, way,, that, it's, much, easier, to, follow, a, story, when, there, are, personal, stakes., And, it, gives, the, storytellers, something, to, sink, their, teeth, into., I, bring, this, up, because, this, is, an, argument, I, have, with, Guillaume, and, David, every, now, and, then., The, player, character, stories, in, We, Happy, Few, are, all, intensely, personal., At, a, couple, of, points, during, our, development, of, the, game,, G, and, David, have, complained, that, the, stakes, weren't, global, enough., "I, know, Arthur's, trying, to, find, his, brother,, but, that's, not, necessarily, what, the, player, is, trying, to, do.", I, rewrote, the, ending, recently, to, make, sure, that, the, player, gets, both, a, satisfying, end, to, Arthur's, story,, and, a, satisfying, ending, to, his, ownÂ story,, that, is,, the, story, of, his, gameplay., We, have, done, a, fair, amount, of, work, aligning, player, motivation, with, player, character, motivation., When, those, two, are, aligned,, you, get, the, player, engaged, both, emotionally, and, intellectually., When, we, release, the, story,, let, me, know, how, we, did., UPDATE:, Â Turns, out, Jensen's, boss,, Jim, Miller, has, a, kid, who, needs, an, augmentation, to, walk, again,, and, he, and, his, ex-husband, disagree, about, that, ..., and, suddenly, I, care, a, lot, about, Miller, and, how, his, story, is, going, to, end., 10:12, PM, 1, comments, Post, a, Comment, Sunday,, October, 02,, 2016, How, do, I, break, in, as, a, writer:, Games, version, Q., I've, always, had, a, strong, interest, in, writing, which, is, why, I, went, on, to, pursue, a, degree, in, English., I, would, like, very, much, to, pursue, know, what, it, would, take, for, me, to, become, part, of, a, team, of, creators., Is, it, better, to, have, Master's, degree, as, opposed, to, a, Bachelor's?, Would, it, be, preferable, to, have, degrees, in, different, fields, of, study?, Does, Compulsion, Games, offer, internships, for, individuals, seeking, experience, and, exposure?, We, don't, offer, internships., We're, a, small, team, of, 25, fairly, experienced, people., The, company, philosophy, is, that, if, you're, good, enough, to, work, there,, you're, good, enough, to, pay., The, game, industry,, like, showbiz,, is, not, particularly, interested, in, whether, you, have, a, parchment, in, a, frame, with, Praeses, et, Socii, Universitatis, on, it., We're, interested, in, whether, you, have, skills,, experience, and, talent., So, if, you're, an, artist,, we, don't, care, if, you, went, to, art, school,, we, want, to, see, your, portfolio., Now, obviously, you, learn, a, lot, in, art, school,, and, you, can, put, together, a, good, portfolio, there,, so, many, games, artists, went, to, art, school., But, it's, the, portfolio,, not, the, credential., Same, for, programming., Show, us, what, you've, done,, and, we'll, give, you, a, programming, test., Pass, the, programming, test,, and, we'll, interview, you., You, may, very, well, have, learned, to, program, in, a, computer, science, department,, but, if, you, taught, yourself, online,, or, out, of, books,, that's, cool., The, head, of, the, company, started, working, at, 17, as, a, programmer., My, first, wife, taught, herself, to, program, after, finishing, her, Ph., D., in, Folklore,, and, she's, been, a, programmer, ever, since., (She, figured, that, if, she, could, learn, 14, dead, languages,, computer, languages, couldn't, be, that, hard., She, was, right,, too.), What, schools, do, teach, you, is, the, tools., For, example,, Montreal's, CÃ©gep, du, Vieux, MontrÃ©al, will, teach, you, Unreal., (For, free,, if, you're, a, QuÃ©becer.), Level, Designers, and, Environmental, Artists, make, the, world, of, our, game, in, Unreal, 4., However,, I, don't, know, how, you, become, a, game, writer., My, path, involved, having, written, a, hit, comedy, film, and, directed, a, bunch, of, shorts., I, moved, into, games, laterally., I, did, not, have, to, convince, anyone, that, I, could, write, dialog,, or, tell, a, story., My, first, few, game, writing, jobs, did, not, involve, any, special, software,, or, even, much, in, the, way, of, the, elaborate, spreadsheets, we're, using, to, track, dialog, in, We, Happy, Few., So, there, were, no, software, tools, to, know., (Basically, I, now, use, Google, Sheets,, Google, Docs,, Final, Draft, and, Pro, Tools., Pro, Tools, is, the, only, serious, badass, professional, bit, of, software., It's, for, editing, sound.), I, actually, do, have, an, MFA,, but, I, think, the, most, valuable, part, of, my, MFA, was, having, an, excuse, to, muck, about, with, cameras, for, three, years., I, did, learn, a, few, things, about, directing, actors, and, cutting, audio,, but, I, did, not, learn, to, write, at, UCLA,, or, Yale., I, learned, to, write, by, writing,, for, free, and, then, for, money,, for, many,, many, years., I, don't, have, a, terribly, good, idea, how, someone, becomes, a, pro, games, writer., You, can, attend, game, jams., There's, good, info, inÂ The, Game, Narrative, Toolbox,, which, my, friend, Ann, Lemay, contributed, to., Better,, you, can, teach, yourself, Twine, (it's, trivial, to, learn), and, create, an, interactive, HTML, text, narrative, which, someone, can, easily, play., Even, better,, you, can, learn, how, to, make, mods,, and, create, story, modules, in, various, game, engines,, e.g., you, could, create, your, own, Shadowrun, story., There, are, some, amazing, mods, out, there,, and, modding, communities, full, of, volunteers, that, make, them., If, you, can, show, us, a, mod, you, made,, that, ought, to, show, us, that, you, know, how, to, make, a, video, game, narrative., Game, societies, are, good,, e.g., the, IGDA., But, there, are, no, agents, in, game, writing., In, TV, you, write, a, spec, and, a, spec, pilot,, get, an, agent,, and, get, pitched, to, showrunners., I'm, not, sure, what, the, equivalent, is, in, games., If, anyone, reading, this, has, a, better, idea, how, to, become, a, game, writer,, please, write, in!, 5:51, PM, 0, comments, Post, a, Comment, Saturday,, October, 01,, 2016, A, new, Final, Draft!, As, soon, as, I, get, back, to, writing, script, pages, (as, opposed, to, barks),, I'm, going, to, be, trying, out, Final, Draft, 10., There, are, two, main, script, formatting, programs,, Final, Draft, and, Screenwriter., (There's, also, CeltX,, which, is, free,, but, I, don't, know, any, pros, who, use, it.), I, have, friends, who, swear, by, Screenwriter, (and, at, Final, Draft!)., Personally,, I've, always, found, Final, Draft, easier, and, more, intuitive, to, use., It's, probably, not, an, accident, that, Final, Draft, started, out, as, a, Mac, program, and, Screenwriter, started, out, on, PC., Screenwriter, is, powerful, once, you, learn, how, to, use, it,, but, you, have, to, just, somehow, know, that,, for, example,, the, way, to, get, a, parenthetical, is, to, type, an, open, parenthesis, at, the, beginning, of, a, line, of, dialog., Or, read, the, manual,, I, suppose., Crazy,, right?, The, people, who, make, Final, Draft, have, just, come, out, with, Final, Draft, 10,, the, latest, edition, of, the, 25-year-old, software., It, has, some, neat, tricks:, Alt, Dialog, You, can, now, hide, alt, dialog, lines, right, in, the, script., You, can, have, three, versions, of, a, line, of, dialog,, and, quickly, switch, between, them., Handy, if, you're, punching, up, a, script., This, is, really, neat., Beat, Board, Final, Draft, 9, had, index, cards, based, on, your, formatted, script., Each, scene, in, Script, View, turned, into, an, index, card, in, Scene, Navigator, view., You, could, shuffle, your, index, cards, around., However,, unless, your, screen, is, much, bigger, than, mine,, you, rarely, have, enough, real, estate, to, see, all, your, index, cards., I've, wound, up, printing, them, out, and, moving, them, around, on, the, kitchen, table., Beat, Board, is, a, more, sophisticated, way, of, viewing, your, whole, story., You, have, a, scene, timeline;, you, can, hang, your, scenes, on, the, timeline,, and, quickly, view, them., You, can, color, code, them,, for, example, if, you, want, to, track, dramatic, beats, vs., action, bears,, or, two, subplots., Being, able, to, view, the, whole, timeline, makes, it, easier, to, see, if, your, structure, is, unbalanced., Collaboration, Tools, At, Compulsion,, we, have, a, lot, of, shared, Google, Documents., I, share, the, encounter, dialog, with, the, level, designers, and, the, audio, people., That, way, we, can, track, a, line, from, writing, to, recording, to, editing, to, integration., Up, till, now,, the, only, way, to, co-write, a, script, in, Final, Draft, is, to, email, versions, back, and, forth., That's, the, way, I, prefer, to, work., But, when, you, go, over, the, script, on, the, phone, (did, you, know, phones, can, be, used, for, talking?),, only, one, person, can, talk., FD, 10, allows, several, writers, to, open, the, same, script, and, edit, it, at, the, same, time,, just, like, you, can, with, a, Google, Doc., Now,, this, is, not, a, proper, review, of, FD, 10., The, folks, at, Final, Draft, were, kind, enough, to, give, me, a, review, copy,, but, as, it, happens,, I, am, doing, everything, at, the, moment, except, writing, dialog, pages., I'm, helping, a, game, cast, an, actor., I'm, writing, barks., I'm, editing, audio., So, I'm, going, to, have, to, wait, until, I'm, back, to, dialog, pages, before, I, can, tell, you, how, well, all, these, handy, new, tools, work., Tune, in, later!, 5:34, PM, 0, comments, Post, a, Comment, Sunday,, September, 18,, 2016, Points, If, you, want, Canadian, government, support, for, your, movie,, you, need, Canadians, in, key, positions., There, are, ten, possible, points,, for, director,, producer,, writer,, editor,, composer,, key, cast,, etc., The, current, government, is, planning, to, reduce, the, requirement, so, you, don't, need, Canadian, writers., I, have, some, experience, that, may, be, relevant., In, the, 90s,, I, worked, for, a, few, indie, production, companies, in, LA, that, were, trying, to, make, movies, in, Canada., Specifically,, they, were, trying, to, make, Quebec, co-productions, so, they, could, access, Canadian, and, Quebecois, government, subsidies, that, amounted, to, about, 25%, of, a, film's, budget., A, wholly, Canadian, production, needed, 10, out, of, 10, points., That, wasn't, very, attractive, to, an, LA, production, company, because, there, were, very, few, bankable, stars, willing, to, appear, in, a, co-production., (Donald, Sutherland, came, up, a, lot.), There, were, also, not, a, lot, of, Canadian, film, directors, acceptable, to, foreign, distributors., However,, a, co-production, could, allocate, some, of, those, roles, to, the, co-production, company., So, a, UK-Canada, co-production, could, have,, say,, a, British, director, if, it, had, a, script, by, a, Canadian., It, could, have, a, British, co-star., Moreover,, each, co-production, company, got, to, have, one, American, cast, member,, so, the, top, two, cast, members, would, be, bankable, Americans., The, point, wasn't, to, make, movies, about, British, or, Canadian, culture., The, point, was, to, make, low-budget, direct-to-video, movies, for, the, international, sales, market;, in, other, words,, American, thrillers, and, action, movies, and, family, films, and, so, forth., The, characters, were, all, supposed, to, be, Americans,, and, the, stories, set, in, the, US., I, worked, on,, for, example,, an, Israeli-Canadian, co-pro;, a, French-Israeli-Canadian, co-pro;, a, Dutch-Canadian, co-pro;, a, French-Canadian-Israeli, co-pro, shot, financed, through, a, Welsh, TV, station, and, shot, in, Poland., The, Canadian, government, is, now, considering, changing, the, Broadcast, Act, as, regards, 10-out-of-10, native, Canadian, productions, that, access, Federal, subsidies., They, are, considering, reducing, the, required, points, to, 6, out, of, 10., So,, let, me, tell, you, what, will, happen:, American, producers, will, swoop, in, and, start, making, American, movies, with, Canadian, government, money., These, movies, will, be, shot, in, Canada., They, will, have, Canadian, composers, and, Canadian, editors., The, name-below-the-title, cast, will, be, Canadian., But, they, will, be, American, movies., The, mailboxes, will, be, blue,, not, red., The, lawyers, will, wear, suits,, not, robes., The, stories, will, be, generic, thrillers, and, action, movies, and, cabin-in-the-woods, horror, movies., These, American, movies, will, snaffle, up, all, the, Federal, funds, for, movies,, so, very, few, actually, Canadian, stories, get, told., No, more, Les, Invasions, Barbares;, no, more, Atarnajuat:, The, Fast, Runner;, no, more, Incendies;, no, more, Away, from, Her;, no, more, Bon, Cop, /, Bad, Cop., Just, Porky's, and, Resident, Evil, from, now, on., Canada, already, has, support, for, service, productions, --, films, that, shoot, up, here, to, take, advantage, of, the, weakened, state, of, the, Canadian, dollarette., This, would, be, taxpayers, funding, American, stories., Apparently, the, government, is, also, considering, loosening, up, the, CMF, rules,, so, American-written, TV, shows, can, satisfy, Canadian, content, requirements, for, broadcasters., Now,, there, are, some, good, proposed, changes., For, example,, under, current, rules,, a, Canadian, produced, show, can't, touch, cultural, subsidies, without, a, Canadian, broadcaster., This, requirement, may, be, scotched,, and, good, riddance., I've, had, TV, show, pitches, that, had, interest, from,, say,, the, BBC,, but, couldn't, get, a, Canadian, broadcaster,, and, therefore, didn't, get, made., But, the, 6-out-of-10, proposal, would, mean, the, elimination, of, Canadian, culture, on, film, and, television., Canadian, film, and, TV, would, become, strictly, service, for, American, producers, looking, to, save, a, few, bucks., That's, not, why, we, have, the, Broadcast, Act., I, know, this, isn't, coming, from, the, top., Lisa, and, I, were, honoured, to, have, Justin, Trudeau, over, to, lunch, years, ago,, when, he, was, running, for, his, first, seat, in, Parliament., He, was, gung-ho, about, the, need, for, Canada, to, support, its, own, culture., More, than, that:, when, I, argued, that, Canadian, movies, were, good, for, tourism,, he, made, the, point, that, films, that, show, the, dark, side, of, Canada, were, important, too., A, nation, needs, its, voice., I, spent, a, decade, working, for, American, companies, trying, to, get, around, Canadian, cultural, content, rules, to, make, American, movies, with, Canadian, taxpayer, money., They, hired, Americans, and, Dutch, guys, and, British, guys, who, had, "permanent, residence", in, Canada, but, actually, lived, in, LA., One, of, the, movies, had, an, American, writer,, so, they, found, an, Israeli, in, Tel, Aviv, with, the, same, name, and, gave, him, the, credit., Producers, will, perform, shenanigans, if, they, possibly., Reduce, the, points,, and, you, open, the, floodgates., Don't, be, surprised, when, all, the, culture, flows, out., 12:30, AM, 1, comments, Post, a, Comment, Saturday,, September, 17,, 2016, Predictability, Drama, is, conflict., Someone, wants, something;, they, can't, get, it., To, make, it, a, complete, story,, they, get, it,, or, they, don't, get, it., However,, drama, also, needs, conflict, between, what, the, audience, expects,, and, what, happens., Even, if, we, know, the, outcome,, we, need, to, not, know, how, it's, going, to, get, there,, or, at, least, not, know, how, we're, going, to, feel, about, it., I, recently, read, a, few, pages, of, a, script, about, an, Important, Social, Issue., As, sometimes, happens, in, scripts, about, Important, Social, Issues,, the, good, people, were, good,, and, the, bad, people, were, bad., I, knew, what, was, going, to, happen, and, I, knew, how, I, was, supposed, to, feel, about, it., And,, indeed,, events, unfolded, as, expected., In, this, case,, the, problem, was, that, the, main, character, was, the, person, bearing, the, brunt, of, the, Important, Social, Issue,, i.e., the, victim, of, discrimination., It's, much, harder, to, make, a, compelling, story, about, a, suffering, saint., There's, conflict,, all, right, --, the, saint, can't, get, what, he, wants, --, but, I'm, not, pulled, in, because, there's, none, of, this, second, sort, of, dramatic, tension., How, are, events, going, to, unfold?, How, am, I, going, to, feel, about, them?, However,, what, if, the, same, story, had, been, told, from, another, perspective, --, from, the, persecutor's, point, of, view?, What, if, we, humanized, the, bad, guy,, and, showed, him, torn, between, his, reasons, for, persecuting,, and, his, dawning, recognition, that, maybe, he's, not, righteous., (Are, we, the, baddies?), Then, I, wouldn't, be, sure, how, to, feel., And, I, wouldn't, know, exactly, what, was, going, to, happen., Or,, if, the, saint, isn't, really, a, saint, but, a, bit, of, a, jackass., Or, if, the, saint, has, doubts., I, realize, that, there, are, movies, about, saintly, figures,, from, Jackie, to, Martin, to, Jesus., We, know, the, stations, of, the, cross,, and, we, get, a, certain, catharsis, from, watching, a, passion, play., There's, no, dramatic, tension., Instead,, there's, comfort, in, knowing, exactly, how, we're, going, to, feel., It's, the, sort, of, comfort, we're, seeking, when, we, watch, "mac'n'cheese", TV,, where, we, know, the, cops, will, catch, the, bad, guys, and, we're, not, even, in, much, doubt, how, they'll, do, it., Or, watching, an, old, Star, Trek, episode., But, take, a, look, at, your, work., Is, there, not, only, tension, between, the, characters,, but, tension, between, the, audience's, assumptions, and, how, you, tell, the, story?, Then, you're, off, to, the, races., 10:24, AM, 0, comments, Post, a, Comment, Monday,, August, 22,, 2016, Two, TV, Writers, Watch, a, TV, Show, So, we, watched, THE, GET, DOWN, on, Netflix,, Baz, Luhrmann's, show, about, the, birth, of, rap, during, the, disco, era., I, gather, this, show, has, provoked, some, controversy,, being, a, show, about, black, and, Puerto, Rican, people, in, the, South, Bronx, in, the, 70's, made, by, a, white, dude, from, Australia., I, don't, really, care, if, it's, accurate., I'm, not, watching, Baz, Luhrmann, because, he's, a, documentarian., I'm, watching, him, because, ROMEO+JULIET, and, MOULIN, ROUGE!, Oh,, and, because, I, lived, New, York, in, the, 70's,, and, yeah,, it, was, like, that,, dirty, and, beautiful,, and, full, of, despair, and, dreams., Anyway,, an, hour, into, the, show,, after, all, sorts, of, michegas,, a, character, tells, the, hero, about, a, secret, dance, event, called, the, Get, Down,, and, asks,, "Have, you, ever, heard, of, someone, named, Grandmaster, Flash,", and, chills, went, down, my, spine,, because, this, is, the, epoch, of, disco, and, the, kid, is, a, rapper, without, knowing, it,, and, yes,, I, have, heard, of, Grandmaster, Flash., And, I, look, on, the, TV,, and, I, realize, there's, another, 15, minutes, of, this., Whut?, No., No,, Mr., Luhrmann., That, is, your, out., That, is, how, you, end, your, pilot., So, we, turned, it, off., Not, that, we, weren't, enjoying, it., But, that, was, the, perfect, ending, to, the, episode., So, we, made, an, executive, decision., TV, writers, watch, differently., I, have, many, times, gone, to, a, movie, with, my, friend, Doug,, a, movie, writer,, and, afterwards, we, fix, the, plot., Lisa, sometimes, accuses, me, of, having, ruined, TV, for, her,, because, she, now, sees, the, seams, and, stitches, of, the, shows, she's, watching, â, when, the, seams, and, stitches, are, showing,, that, is., On, the, other, hand,, when, you, see, something, really, great,, you, appreciate, it, all, the, more., And, you, can, turn, off, the, show, an, hour, in, if, it's, earned, its, out., 9:17, PM, 0, comments, Post, a, Comment, Morgan, le, Fay--, King, Arthur's, lover, and, nemesis, --was, a, teenage, girl, once..., Thinking, of, Buying, Art?, Read,
