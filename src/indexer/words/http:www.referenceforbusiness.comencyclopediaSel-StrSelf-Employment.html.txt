Self-Employment, SELF-EMPLOYMENT, Classification, of, someone, as, employed, or, self-employed, depends, on, several, factors,, including, degree, of, independence,, the, freedom, to, hire, others, to, do, the, work, taken, on,, the, freedom, to, work, for, others,, and, the, assumption, of, risks., Courts, have, held, that, the, individual, does, not, necessarily, have, to, provide, the, equipment, to, do, the, job,, as, in, the, case, of, independent, television, and, film, mixers, working, on, equipment, owned, by, client, production, companies., A, worker's, status, as, a, self-employed, worker, can, be, reinforced, by, having, multiple, clients,, being, paid, based, on, work, done, instead, of, on, hours, worked,, or, obtaining, an, employer, identification, number, from, the, Internal, Revenue, Service, (IRS), by, filing, form, SS-4., Working, under, a, business, name, also, helps, reinforce, this, status., For, some, self-employed, workers,, their, business, name, is, simply, their, own, name., Stipulating, in, written, contracts, that, either, party, can, be, dismissed, on, 30, days', notice, helps, differentiate, self-employed, workers, from, employees,, who, often, cannot, be, fired, at, will., Printing, invoices,, business, cards,, and, stationery, also, help, identify, a, worker, as, being, self-employed., In, addition,, employees, have, more, statutory, rights,, benefits,, and, protections, than, self-employed, workers,, who, must, generally, negotiate, protections, and, obtain, their, own, insurance,, retirement, plans,, etc., In, other, words,, self-employed, workers, typically, do, not, receive, fringe, benefits, or, pay, Social, Security,, Medicare,, and, income, tax, installments, directly., Variations, of, the, term, include, "independent, contractors,", "free, agents,", "freelancers,", "consultants,", "sole, proprietors,", and,, creatively,, "soloists,", "virtual, employees,", "corporate, refugees,", "corporate, mutineers,", "lone, wolves,", "lone, rangers,", and, "lone, eagles.", While, agencies, and, organizations, did, not, collect, accurate, and, consistent, statistics, of, employed, versus, self-employed, workers, until, the, Decennial, Census, in, 1940,, the, data, available, from, the, late, 19th, century, and, the, early, 20th, century, suggest, that, a, significant, portion, of, the, work, force, was, self-employed., Furthermore,, the, systematic, survey, and, classification, of, the, self-employed, in, 1940, indicated, that, 10, million, people, were, self-employed, as, unincorporated, businesses, largely, performing, agricultural,, fishing,, and, forestry, tasks., These, 10, million, self-employed, workers, accounted, for, about, 20, percent, of, the, work, force, in, 1940., In, contrast,, there, were, still, around, 10, million, self-employed, workers, in, mid-1999, (10.1, million, as, of, May, 1999),, but, they, accounted, for, only, about, 9, percent, of, the, total, work, force., Moreover,, the, percentage, of, self-employed, agricultural, workers, has, plummeted:, whereas, self-employed, agricultural, workers, represented, 90, percent, of, the, self-employed, in, 1940,, they, represented, about, 8, percent, in, 1999., Instead,, service, and, executive/administrative, occupations, supplanted, farming-related, ones, as, the, primary, occupations, of, the, self-employed,, together, accounting, for, almost, 30, percent, of, all, self-employed, workers, in, the, mid-, to, late, 1990s,, according, to, the, U.S., Bureau, of, Labor, Statistics, (BLS)., Self-employment, declined, after, World, War, II,, dropping, to, under, 7, percent, of, the, labor, pool, by, 1969,, but, it, began, to, increase, slowly, by, the, mid-1970s., Self-employment, received, increased, attention, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, as, many, large, firms, responded, to, the, growth, of, competition, and, a, lingering, recession, by, "downsizing,", or, reducing, the, size, of, their, "permanent", staffs, and, hiring, temporary, employees, and, contracting, with, self-employed, workers, to, reduce, overhead., Some, such, groups, of, businesses, have, been, called, "virtual, corporations,", as, they, perform, functions, formerly, grouped, under, a, single, corporation,, but, legally, do, not, exist, under, one, ownership., While, in, the, past, a, large, company, using, freelancers, seemed, to, imply, a, crisis,, it, became, a, commonplace, way, to, control, costs, and, try, out, new, talent, in, the, 1990s., The, increase, in, self-employment,, moreover,, can, be, attributed, partially, to, workers', compensation,, social, security,, and, job, protection, laws,, which, have, made, employers, cautious, about, hiring, full-time, employees., In, addition,, sometimes, smaller, companies, only, can, afford, to, temporarily, hire, professionals, who, have, had, experience, at, larger,, more, sophisticated, companies., While, self-employment, has, a, number, of, benefits, such, as, independence, and, job, flexibility,, it, also, has, some, drawbacks., Intermittent, income, is, one, of, the, most, important, difficulties, the, newly, independent, businessperson, must, face., Downtime, can, be, avoided, by, overscheduling, or, moonlighting,, working, a, salaried, job,, also., New, business, owners, are, advised, not, to, rely, on, their, enterprises, for, income, for, at, least, the, first, six, months;, comfortable, returns, may, not, follow, for, months, afterward., SELF-EMPLOYMENT, DATA, One, of, the, primary, sources, for, statistics, on, self-employment, in, the, United, States, is, the, monthly, Current, Population, Survey, (CPS)., The, CPS, was, launched, in, 1940, as, part, of, an, effort, to, determine, monthly, unemployment, levels,, because, the, Great, Depression, still, affected, the, country, at, the, time., This, survey, includes, data, on, different, classes, of, workers—as, well, as, on, other, aspects, of, employment, such, as, industry, and, occupation—which, refers, to, the, distinction, between, agricultural, and, nonagricultural, workers, and, between, wage, and, self-employed, workers,, in, addition, to, other, classes, of, workers, not, relevant, here., The, CPS, tracks, whether, people, over, the, age, of, 16, are, employed,, unemployed, (seeking, employment),, or, not, in, the, work, force, at, all., Those, who, have, jobs, are, then, classified, as, employed, by, government,, private, companies,, or, nonprofit, organizations,, or, as, self-employed., Workers, indicating, they, are, employed, by, government,, private, companies,, or, non-profit, organizations, are, classified, as, wage, and, salary, workers,, whereas, workers, indicating, they, are, self-employed, are, classified, as, self-employed,, if, their, business, is, not, incorporated., If, self-employed, workers, have, incorporated, businesses,, they, are, classified, as, wage, and, salary, workers,, because, they, are, technically, employees, of, their, own, businesses, according, to, the, law., (Incorporation, establishes, a, company, as, a, legal, entity—the, corporation—which, is, permitted, to, enter, into, contracts, and, open, bank, accounts., A, corporation, also, has, tax, advantages.), This, method, of, questioning, has, largely, been, consistent, since, 1948,, with, the, exception, of, the, distinction, between, being, self-employed, and, owning, an, incorporated, business,, which, was, adopted, in, 1967., The, BLS, also, has, another, relevant, survey:, the, Contingent, and, Alternative, Work, Arrangements, Supplement, to, the, Current, Population, Survey., This, survey, is, conducted, every, two, years, and, it, tracks, self-employed, workers, classified, as, independent, contractors., Respondents, who, indicated, they, were, self-employed, but, not, incorporated, in, CPS, survey, are, asked, if, they, are, self-employed, as, independent, contractors,, independent, consultants,, or, freelance, workers., TYPES, OF, SELF-EMPLOYMENT, The, Bureau, of, Labor, Statistics, distinguishes, between, two, types, of, self-employed, workers:, independent, contractors, and, business, owners, who, have, not, incorporated, their, businesses, (as, mentioned, above,, owners, of, incorporated, businesses, are, not, classified, as, self-employed, according, to, BLS, criteria)., Independent, contractors, include, workers, who, are, self-employed, on, a, contract, basis., The, contracts, they, receive, contracts, specify, the, type, and, amount, of, work, they, are, to, perform, as, well, as, work-related, arrangements, and, legal, issues., There, are, many, different, types, of, independent, contractors:, professionals, leaving, corporate, life,, youngsters, delivering, papers,, single, parents, stuffing, envelopes, at, home,, and, construction-related, workers., Professional, and, white, collar, self-employment, services, include, editing,, developing, and, running, training, programs,, writing,, graphic, design,, consulting,, and, financial, services., On, the, other, hand,, self-employed, business, owners, (e.g., family, and, home, business, owners), refer, to, operations, that, have, not, been, incorporated,, which, generally, have, few, employees., Self-employed, business, owners, take, the, form, of, anything, from, restaurant, owners, to, store, owners., The, overall, number, of, self-employed, workers, in, the, United, States, in, the, late, 1990s, stood, at, about, 10, million., In, general,, male, independent, contractors, tended, to, work, as, managers,, construction, workers,, writers, and, artists,, and, real, estate, and, insurance, agents, in, the, late, 1990s,, whereas, female, independent, contractors, tended, to, work, as, managers,, writers, and, artists,, real, estate, and, insurance, agents,, salespeople,, and, childcare, providers,, according, to, the, BLS., Overall,, about, 17, percent, of, self-employed, workers, performed, executive,, administrative,, and, managerial, tasks, during, this, period., These, workers, either, ran, their, own, businesses, or, were, self-employed, as, accountants, and, other, professionals., By, 2006,, the, BLS, expects, the, percentage, of, self-employed, professionals, to, reach, 18.7., Self-employed, workers, performing, service-related, tasks, such, as, providing, child, care, or, home, health, care, services, accounted, for, 11.5, percent, of, all, self-employed, workers, during, this, period, and, the, percentage, of, self-employed, service, workers, is, forecast, to, reach, 12.6, percent, by, 2006., CHARACTERISTICS, OF, THE, SELF-EMPLOYED, Various, personal, characteristics, seem, to, steer, people, into, self-employment,, such, as, being, the, oldest, child, or, having, parents, who, were, self-employed., In, addition,, individuals, are, more, likely, to, become, self-employed, if, they, have, been, fired, from, more, than, one, job,, have, been, previously, employed, in, small, businesses,, are, college, graduates,, are, realistic, risk, takers,, and, are, well-organized, and, good, at, organizing, others., Furthermore,, many, are, immigrants, or, children, of, immigrants., Some, personality, requirements, for, success, as, a, self-employed, worker, are, confidence,, a, positive, outlook,, friendliness,, and, the, determination, to, succeed., Self-employed, individuals, as, a, whole, tend, to, work, longer, hours, (an, additional, 4, hours, per, week,, according, to, the, Bureau, of, Labor, Statistics), and, work, harder, than, their, wage, and, salary, counterparts—and, they, do, it, for, irregular, pay, and,, frequently,, fewer, benefits., About, 26, percent, of, all, independent, contractors, worked, less, than, 35, hours, a, week,, while, 30, percent, worked, 49, hours, a, week, in, the, late, 1990s., The, average, work, for, all, independent, contracts, was, 46.3, hours., In, addition,, the, income, and, assets, of, self-employed, workers, are, dependent, on, their, work, contributions, in, a, more, intimate, way, than, are, those, of, their, wage, and, salary, counterparts., Not, surprisingly,, a, study, of, certified, public, accountants, in, 1986, found, the, self-employed, ones, to, have, higher, levels, of, organizational, commitment., In, addition,, self-employed, workers, who, were, independent, contractors, earned, more, on, average, than, their, wage, and, salary, counterparts., For, example,, the, BLS, reported, that, independent, contractors, earned, an, average, of, $587, per, week, in, 1997,, whereas, wage, and, salary, workers, averaged, $510, per, week., Studies, concerning, the, amount, of, education, of, self-employed, individuals, point, out, that, higher, education, generally, may, lead, to, higher, pay., The, BLS, indicated, that, college, graduate, independent, contractors, averaged, $752, per, week,, while, high, school, graduate, independent, contractors, averaged, $512, per, week., Independent, contractors, who, did, not, graduate, from, high, school, averaged, even, less:, $398, per, week., Furthermore,, education, also, can, play, a, key, role, in, whether, or, not, a, worker, is, self-employed,, although, it, depends, to, some, extent, on, how, being, self-employed, is, defined., A, common, assumption, has, been, that, those, with, a, higher, level, of, education, are, more, apt, to, be, self-employed., Studies, based, on, unincorporated, self-employed, workers, have, confirmed, this, belief, to, some, extent, by, showing, a, moderate, correlation, between, education, level, and, self-employment., For, example,, a, higher, proportion, of, independent, contractors, have, four, years, of, college, or, more, than, wage, and, salary, workers, do,, according, to, the, Bureau, of, Labor, Statistics., Approximately, 34, percent, of, independent, contractors, between, the, age, of, 25, and, 64—who, make, up, about, 50, percent, all, self-employed, workers—had, college, degrees, in, the, late, 1990s,, while, 29, percent, of, their, wage, and, salary, counterparts, had, college, degrees., The, self-employed, have, been, found, to, report, lower, absences,, which, has, been, attributed, not, to, superior, health, but, the, feeling, of, being, indispensable., In, fact,, their, jobs, tend, to, be, more, physically, and, psychologically, stressful, due, to, the, investments, in, energy, the, jobs, demand., Yet, certain, stress, factors, are, generally, absent, from, self-employment—such, as, corporate, meetings, and, employee, discipline, problems,, although, dealing, with, clients, presents, its, own, stress,, such, as, rush, orders, and, negotiations., Age, is, a, significant, characteristic, when, examining, self-employment, trends., As, workers, get, older,, their, chances, of, being, self-employed, increases., For, example,, 2.5, percent, of, workers, 20-24, years, old, are, self-employed,, whereas, 10.5, percent, of, workers, 45-54, years, old, and, 26, percent, of, workers, 65, and, over, are, self-employed,, according, to, BLS, statistics, from, the, mid-1990s., The, BLS, attributes, this, trend, to, the, greater, prevalence, of, self-employment, when, older, workers, first, entered, the, work, force, and, to, the, inclination, of, older, workers, to, launch, post-retirement, careers, or, second, careers., Moreover,, younger, workers, often, lack, the, necessary, skills, and, funds, to, become, self-employed., Based, on, numbers,, the, largest, group, of, self-employed, workers, is, the, group, of, workers, 35-44, year, old,, which, totals, about, 1.9, million., In, addition,, about, 7, percent, of, working, women, are, self-employed,, whereas, 10, percent, of, working, men, are, self-employed., SMALL, BUSINESSES, AND, HOME, BUSINESSES, Small, business, ownership, is, a, significant, part, self-employment,, which, accounts, for, about, 50, percent, of, self-employed, workers., As, previously, mentioned,, the, BLS, does, not, classify, such, business, owners, who, have, incorporated, their, businesses, as, self-employed., A, study, of, small, businesses, by, Robert, L., Aronson, indicated, that, 31, percent, of, the, small, businesses, in, the, retail, industry, employed, no, workers, and, 67, percent, in, the, construction, industry, employed, no, workers,, indicating, a, significant, amount, of, self-employment, among, small, businesses., The, self-employed, small, business, owner, must, make, many, management, decisions,, such, as, keeping, precise, accounting, and, tax, records,, projecting, cash, flow,, and, making, purchasing, decisions., More, successful, individuals, can—and, frequently, must—hire, another, professional, to, take, on, some, of, these, tasks,, particularly, accounting,, but, also, sometimes, filing,, manufacturing,, billing,, maintaining, databases,, mailing, brochures,, or, selling., Self-employment, is, often, associated, with, working, at, home., However,, wage, and, salary, workers, also, work, at, home, under, various, arrangements, with, their, employers,, so, this, characteristic, is, not, exclusive, to, self-employed, workers., In, 1997,, managers, and, professionals, accounted, for, the, largest, share, of, home-based, self-employed, workers—1.7, million, workers—according, to, the, BLS., Other, leading, fields, of, home-based, self-employment, that, year, included, sales,, service,, and, precision, production., The, service, industry, accounted, for, 2.1, million, home-based, workers,, followed, by, construction, workers, with, 726,000, and, retail, workers, with, 532,000., The, personal, computer, and, communications, technology, have, made, working, at, home, more, feasible, throughout, the, 1980s, and, 1990s., Mastering, these, technologies, has, become, essential, for, those, without, staffs., Through, cellular, telephones, and, pagers,, the, self-employed, professional, can, stay, in, touch, with, clients, throughout, the, day., Fax, machines, and, modems, make, business, over, a, large, geographic, area, feasible, and, help, the, one-person, office, get, work, out, quickly., Computerized, spreadsheet, and, database, programs, are, necessary, to, deal, with, administrative, tasks, quickly, and, efficiently., In, addition,, on-line, services, and, electronic, bulletin, boards, made, instantaneous, local,, cross-country,, and, international, networking, and, research, feasible., Consultants, can, also, use, their, computers, to, "manufacture", or, "distribute'", their, work, product., In, most, cases,, they, make, their, work, process, more, efficient,, as, well., About, 55, percent, of, all, home-based, self-employed, workers, used, a, computer, for, their, work, in, 1997., BECOMING, SELF-EMPLOYED, Many, articles, and, books, on, self-employment, urge, people, to, systematically, plan, their, foray, into, self-employment,, whether, they, intend, to, be, independent, contractors, or, business, owners., The, first, step, is, developing, a, business, plan,, which, includes, determining, individual, interests,, skills,, strengths,, weaknesses,, and, so, on., This, step, also, involves, figuring, out, who, the, potential, customs, and, competitors, will, be, as, well, as, researching, the, market, for, the, intended, line, of, business., In, addition,, part, of, planning, for, self-employment, should, include, establishing, contacts—potential, clients—in, the, intended, market., Next,, those, preparing, for, self-employment, must, begin, marketing, themselves., One, technique,, while, time-consuming, and, expensive,, is, making, cold, calls, and, using, mailing, lists, to, introduce, services, and, skills., In, addition,, self-employed, workers, should, emphasize, their, individual, expertise,, which, marketers, refer, to, as, "unique, selling, propositions.", Speaking, at, conventions, and, writing, for, trade, journals, on, topics, of, professional, competence, are, effective, ways, of, going, about, emphasizing, individual, expertise., However,, marketing, is, not, only, essential, in, the, beginning, but, also, throughout, a, career, as, a, self-employed, worker., Self-employed, workers, also, must, set, competitive, fees., However,, they, often, make, the, mistake, of, undercharging, for, their, services, or, products, at, the, beginning, of, their, enterprises,, at, times, even, doing, work, for, free, with, the, hope, of, impressing, new, clients., This, is, partly, due, to, a, lack, of, confidence, and, partly, because, of, their, justified, concerns, about, competing, in, the, marketplace., This, can, pose, a, serious, dilemma,, as, underpricing, may, not, necessarily, lead, to, more, contracts;, in, fact,, it, can, suggest, a, lack, of, quality., The, best, way, of, setting, prices, is, finding, out, how, much, other, self-employed, workers, in, the, same, field, are, charging, and, basing, fees, on, this, information., As, they, begin, their, enterprises,, self-employed, individuals, feel, compelled, to, accept, a, variety, of, assignments, due, to, sheer, scarcity, of, work., However,, specialization, can, help, ensure, their, long-term, survival., For, one, thing,, corporate, clients, can, often, find, a, generalist's, abilities, in-house., Also,, specialization, may, allow, professionals, to, broaden, their, client, base, geographically—freeing, their, fortunes, from, fluctuations, in, the, local, economy., These, factors, can, enable, the, specialist, to, earn, higher, fees, and, work, more, consistently., Paradoxically,, one's, work, as, a, specialist, can, garner, referrals, outside, one's, specialty,, so, specialization, might, not, be, as, limiting, as, a, strict, definition, would, imply., The, self-employed, should, be, cautioned, against, changing, their, specialties, too, often,, as, this, can, confuse, clients, and, make, their, own, operations, inefficient., Depending, on, the, line, of, business,, self-employed, workers, may, also, have, to, obtain, financing, for, supplies, and, equipment., Hence,, research, of, various, methods, of, financing, may, be, necessary., Finally,, being, self-employed, requires, attention, to, administrative, matters, such, as, record, keeping,, accounting,, insurance,, and, maintaining, equipment., TAX, AND, BENEFIT, ISSUES, IN, SELF-, EMPLOYMENT, Self-employment, has, long, been, a, focus, of, the, Internal, Revenue, Service, (IRS)., The, IRS, estimated, that, the, self-employed, underpay, about, $20, billion, a, year, in, taxes., Independent, contractors, and, sole, proprietors, generally, must, pay, taxes, on, all, business, profits—sales, over, business, expenses., These, self-employed, workers, usually, may, deduct, expenditures, for, work-related, equipment, such, as, computers,, telephones,, trucks,, tools,, and, other, such, expenses., To, reduce, taxes, owed,, forming, a, subchapter, S, corporation, is, an, option,, particularly, when, income, before, expenses, and, taxes, exceeds, $150,000., In, an, S, corporation,, income, is, not, subject, to, self-employment, taxes., Nevertheless,, self-employment, provides, some, tax, advantages,, such, as, retirement, plans, and, home-office, and, transportation, deductions., In, the, simplified, employee, pension, plan, (SEP-IRA),, a, maximum, of, 13.1435, percent, of, net, income, can, be, contributed, to, these, accounts, annually,, up, to, $30,000., A, portion, of, the, home, dedicated, exclusively, to, business, use, may, be, depreciated, over, 31, 1/2, years., A, standard, deduction,, 30, cents, per, mile,, may, be, used, for, business-related, transportation, costs,, or, actual, fuel, and, maintenance, costs., Also,, up, to, 25, percent, of, medical, insurance, premiums, may, be, deducted, for, sole, proprietors,, partners,, and, more-than-2, percent, S, corporation, shareholders;, also,, the, self-employed, pay, Federal, Insurance, Contributions, Act, (FICA), tax, on, net,, not, gross,, earnings., For, these, reasons,, it, is, essential, to, keep, an, accurate, record, of, expenses., However,, there, are, other, tax, disadvantages, for, unincorporated, businesses, besides, the, ones, mentioned, above., For, example,, owners, of, such, businesses, are, not, able, to, fully, deduct, employee, contributions, to, health, insurance., Not, surprisingly,, this, discourages, the, self-employed, from, getting, health, insurance, for, themselves, and, their, employees., Health, insurance, may, be, available, through, one's, prior, employer., The, Consolidated, Omnibus, Budget, Reconciliation, Act(COBRA), requires, companies, with, more, than, 50, employees, to, offer, health, care, coverage, up, to, 18, months, after, an, employee, leaves;, this, may, be, the, only, option, for, people, with, preexisting, conditions, that, preclude, new, insurance, coverage., Under, this, plan,, however,, employees, must, pay, 102, percent, of, their, insurance, premiums, (including, a, two, percent, administrative, fee)., Under, COBRA,, the, departing, employee, is, also, credited, with, deductibles, already, paid,, while, temporary, plans, reset, deductibles., Other, options, include, a, spouse's, company, plan,, a, trade, organization, plan,, or, individual, coverage., Independent, life, insurance, plans, tend, to, give, better, coverage, than, company, plans, that, are, converted, within, 30, days, of, leaving, a, job., Disability, coverage, typically, can't, be, converted,, but, it, can, be, necessary, to, cover, business, overhead, during, an, out-of-work, period., A, single-premium, insurance, policy,, where, only, one, premium, payment, is, required,, is, one, solution, to, the, problem, of, pensions, that, irregular, earnings, creates., SELF-EMPLOYMENT, AND, JOB, GROWTH, While, self-employment, contributed, the, country's, job, growth, in, the, 1980s,, it, appeared, to, have, no, appreciable, effect, in, the, 1990s,, according, to, the, BLS., Between, 1989, and, 1997,, self-employment, accounted, for, only, 0.7, percent, of, employment, growth, in, the, United, States., In, contrast,, it, led, to, 79, percent, of, job, growth, in, Canada,, whose, economy, is, linked, to, the, United, States',, during, this, period., This, contribution, to, overall, job, growth, marks, a, substantial, drop, in, influence, of, self-employment, on, U.S., job, growth,, because, between, 1979, and, 1989, self-employment, was, responsible, for, over, 13, percent, of, the, country's, job, growth., During, the, same, period,, self-employment, accounted, for, about, 17, percent, job, growth, in, Canada., SEE, ALSO, :, Small, Businesses, [, Frederick, C., Ingram, ],
