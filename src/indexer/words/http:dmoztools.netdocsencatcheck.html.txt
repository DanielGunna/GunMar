URL, Notes, Glossary, In, Other, Languages, česky, -, Czech, Deutsch, -, German, Français, -, French, Guide, for, Category, Checkers, By, critiquing, categories, for, other, editors,, you, can, provide, very, valuable, help, that, will, benefit, both, the, editors, and, the, directory, as, a, whole., Conversely,, offering, new, editors, misleading, advice, can, cause, them, to, be, confused, and, frustrated., The, suggestions, contained, within, this, guide, are, intended, to, aid, experienced, editors, in, helping, newer, editors., The, Goal, of, Category, Checking, The, purpose, of, the, cat, check, threads, is, to, get, editors, to, understand, the, official, editing, guidelines,, so, they, can, independently, use, them, as, a, basis, for, good, editorial, judgment, and, common, sense, decision, making., Official, editorial, policy, only, exists, in, the, DMOZ, Guidelines,, category, specific, guidelines,, category, charters,, and, some, category, FAQs., Your, feedback, should, be, backed, up, by, these, guidelines., Avoid, basing, your, feedback, on, opinions, or, comments, made, in, forum, discussions, and, editor's, notes., These, sources, do, not, contain, official, editorial, policy,, but, comments, on, editorial, issues, and, decisions, made, in, very, specific, instances., Unlike, other, threads,, cat, check, threads, provide, feedback, rather, than, discussions, of, editorial, issues., To, avoid, confusion, and, the, proliferation, of, editing, myths,, refrain, from, giving, your, personal, opinion, and, interpretation, of, the, guidelines., For, example,, when, statements, such, as, "You, shouldn't, list, sites, that, do, not, include, a, postal, address", are, made,, new, editors, may, construe, them, as, rules., This, causes, problems,, as, when, somebody, else, advises, new, editors, to, the, contrary,, they, can, become, confused., If, you, can't, cite, guideline, sources, to, back, up, your, comments,, make, it, clear, that, your, comments, are, not, supported, by, official, editorial, policy., Suggested, Steps, 1., Structure, Has, the, editor, made, structural, changes?, Do, they, make, sense?, Has, he, or, she, consulted,

changes, with, fellow, editors., Has, the, editor, created, categories, that, overlap, or, duplicate, others, in, the, directory?, Are, the, category, names, spelled, correctly?, If, this, part, of, the, directory, uses, a, template,, then, the, required, elements, should, not, deviate, from, it., (Note, that, some, templates,, such, as, the, Regional, template,, have, portions, that, are, merely, recommended, or, suggested)., 2., To, Include, or, Not, to, Include, Look, at, the, category's, editing, logs., Has, the, editor, deleted, good,, working, URLs?, Has, the, editor, been, adding, affiliate, links,, or, content-free, deeplinks?, If, so,, direct, her, to, the, Include, or, Not, Include, section, of, the, guidelines,, and, offer, specific, advice, if, he, or, she, has, been, consistently, making, the, same, mistake,, such, as, deleting, all, deeplinks,, sites, that, are, legitimately, dual, listed, in, Regional, and, Topical,, or, sites, on, free, hosts., Is, the, editor, listing, redirects, or, mirrors?, If, so,, point, him, to, here, and, inform, him, of, the, purpose, of, the, Editing, and, URL, notes., 3., Link, Integrity, Run, a, [cat, Test/Tools_for_Editors/Link_Checkers, ;special:link_checker], over, their, category., Make, sure, you, double, check, the, errors, the, link, checker, finds., Some, link, checkers, report, errors, for, URLs, that, work., If, redirecting/erroneous, URLs, are, found,, suggest, that, a, tool, be, used, in, the, future., If, the, editor, is, listing, 'vanity, URLs',, such, as, those, supplied, by, CJB.net,, explain, that, he, or, she, should, list, the, site's, actual, URL, instead., If, necessary,, provide, guidance, as, to, how, the, correct, URL, can, be, obtained., 4., Placement, Were, sites, added, that, belong, in, either, Adult, or, World?, If, so,, explain, the, purpose, of, these, two, categories,, and, point, her, to, either, the, Adult, Guidelines, or, the, World, FAQ, as, appropriate., Is, the, editor, listing, sites, in, one, category, that, would, be, better, placed, in, related, categories?, If, he, or, she, appears, to, be, making, this, mistake, regularly,, then, inform, the, editor, of, the, fact,, suggest, they, re-evaluate, the, scope, of, their, category,, and, indicate, related, categories, to, which, the, category, should, be, linked., If, necessary,, advise, the, editor, to, create/update, a, category, charter, to, help, with, site, placement, and, submissions., 5., Descriptions, Do, the, descriptions, describe, the, content, and/or, subject, matter, of, the, sites?, Do, the, descriptions, read, like, advertisements, or, sales, pitches?, If, so,, give, examples, of, good,, objective, and, unbiased, descriptions,, and, suggest, how, they, could, be, rewritten., Avoid, being, overly, nitpicky, about, the, use, of, adjectives., Focus, on, flagrant, examples, of, marketing, hype,, i.e., words, and, phrases, that, say, nothing, about, the, site's, actual, content, and, subject, matter., Is, the, person, following, the, description, guidelines?, If, not,, cite, the, guideline, not, being, followed,, and, suggest, ways, to, re-work, the, description., Avoid, pointing, out, every, single, problem., If, an, editor, has, made, some, consistent, mistakes,, such, as, spelling, and, punctuation, errors,, simply, point, out, a, few,, and, ask, the, editor, to, review, all, titles, and, descriptions, again, for, these, types, of, errors., The, Positive, as, Well, as, Areas, for, Improvement, Look, to, see, what, the, editor, has, done, well., Constructive, criticism, is, important,, but, so, is, feedback, on, good, editing, practices., Has, he, found, a, lot, of, new, sites, to, add?, Is, she, moving, misplaced, suggestions, rather, than, deleting, them?, Has, the, editor, written, a, useful, category, charter?, If, the, answer, to, any, of, these, questions, is, yes,, congratulate, the, editor., Last, update:, Sat, Jun, 04,
