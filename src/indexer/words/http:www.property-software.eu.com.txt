price, on, something, in, the, wizarding, world, of, Harry, Potter, sounds, like, an, impossible, task., After, all,, having, even, one, magical, item, or, magical, building, would, be, priceless., That, didn’t, stop, David, Cross, from, trying, to, do, the, impossible, (no,, not, that, David, Cross)., Writing, for, the, real, estate, website, Movoto,, Cross, decided, to, figure, out, the, theoretical, real, estate, value, for, the, wizarding, school, of, Hogwarts., To, calculate, the, cost,, he, used, three, determining, factors, for, trying, to, establish, a, price:, location,, comparison, to, other, similar, real, estate,, and, square, footage., In, the, books, and, the, movies,, it, never, says, where, Hogwarts, is, located,, but, there, are, clues, throughout, the, series, that, indicate, the, school, is, situated, in, the, United, Kingdom., The, Hogwarts, Express, leaves, from, London, at, 11:00, AM,, travels, 105, kilometers, (65, mi), per, hour,, and, arrives, at, Hogwarts, at, sunset., That, means,, logistically,, the, only, place, it, could, go, is, Scotland., With, that, in, mind,, the, landscape, and, environment, depicted, in, the, books, and, movies, resemble, the, area, known, as, Galloway, Hills., Looking, at, large, and, expensive, houses, in, the, area,, Cross, determined, that, the, average, price, per, square, foot, would, be, $493., Next,, Cross, had, to, figure, out, how, big, Hogwarts, is., Using, scale, models,, he, figured, out, that, Hogwarts, sits, on, a, property, that, is, approximately, 28, acres., As, for, the, building, itself,, he, calculated, the, square, footage, based, on, the, amount, of, students, that, attend, the, school, every, year,, which, is, 280, pupils., If, there, are, 20, students, per, class,, and, each, student, needs, 5.6, square, meters, (50, ft2), to, learn,, then, each, classroom, would, be, 93, square, meters, (1,000, ft2)., That, means, the, school,, which, is, seven, stories, with, towers, and, an, underground, area,, would, have, a, total, space, of, 38,000, square, meters, (414,000, ft2)., However,, this, does, not, seem, to, include, specialty, rooms, like, the, teachers’, offices,, living, quarters,, a, Quidditch, pitch,, or, the, Great, Hall., But, just, for, the, land,, main, building,, and, towers,, the, real, estate, of, Hogwarts, is, valued, at, around, $204, million., But, that, is, definitely, worth, the, investment, if, it, comes, with, the, Room, of, Requirement., Property, Software, Corporation, June, 10,, 2016, wickvegs, The, font, you, choose, is, important, to, your, site’s, readability., Knowing, the, best, font, size, is, key, to, giving, the, reader, the, best, possible, experience., The, article, below, gives, you, plenty, of, excellent, web, design, tips, to, show, you, the, proper, font, size, to, use., Always, mark, files, that, must, be, opened, in, an, external, program, with, an, icon., Many, sites, host, PDF, files,, and, less, commonly,, DOC, files,, that, must, be, opened, in, Foxit, Reader, and, Microsoft, Word/OpenOffice,, respectively., These, files, should, be, marked, with, an, icon, representing, the, file, type,, and, a, link, to, download, the, appropriate, viewer, if, the, user, does, not, have, it., White, space, is, an, important, part, of, web, design,, so, don’t, be, afraid, to, use, it., Cluttering, up, your, web, pages, with, too, many, images, or, too, much, text,, or, using, a, distracting, background,, will, only, irritate, your, visitors., White, space, can, make, the, important, elements, of, your, page, more, visible., Do, not, work, with, pop-ups., This, is, one, of, those, most, hated, marketing, tactics, on, the, web!, Your, customers, will, agree, that, if, they, visit, a, site,, and, are, overwhelmed, with, pop-ups,, they’re, likely, not, to, return., Just, avoid, these, irritating, ads,, so, your, users, will, be, happy., As, well,, if, your, web, host, makes, it, mandatory, that, you, have, pop-up, advertising,, look, into, a, new, host, asap., It’s, not, worth, the, annoyance, level, they, create. , Regular, newsletters, attract, repeat, website, visitors., You, can, keep, your, visitors, informed, about, important, events,, updates,, and, changes, when, they, sign, up, for, a, newsletter,, and, the, flow, of, information, will, often, tempt, them, to, revisit, your, site., Place, the, form, for, signup, in, a, sidebar, or, at, the, top, of, the, pages, in, your, site,, and, track, those, who, sign, up., Your, newsletter, should, only, go, out, to, those, who, specifically, request, to, receive, it,, or, you, run, the, risk, of, turning, off, your, customers., To, help, you, design, a, site, that, is, easy, for, people, to, read, all, the, information,, make, sure, the, pages, are, not, too, wide., If, the, pages, are, not, too, wide, then, they, will, fit, on, most, people’s, computer, screens., If, the, page, is, too, wide,, then, part, of, your, valuable, information, could, be, left, off, the, page., Choose, your, web, host, carefully., Some, hosts, require, you, to, link, to, them,, while, others, may, force, you, to, install, their, pop-ups., You, should, also, test, their, performance, using, one, of, the, many, tools, available, for, free, online,, as, you, do, not, want, to, host, with, someone, who, is, consistently, slow, or, crashing., Keep, your, education, ongoing., Websites, are, constantly, changing,, every, day,, and, if, you, stop, learning, new, things,, you, may, find, yourself, falling, behind, the, pack, with, your, designs., Try, to, convince, yourself, to, learn, one, new, thing, each, day,, be, it, programming, a, new, background,, or, a, simple, HTML, setup., When, designing, your, site,, try, to, come, up, with, three, or, four, keywords, that, you, expect, users, to, input, into, search, engines, as, they, try, to, find, your, page., These, keywords, should, then, be, repeated, frequently, throughout, the, title,, page, body, and, description, meta, tag., This, will, make, it, easier, for, users, to, locate, your, site, on, the, web., To, help, you, design, a, website, that, is, free, of, clutter,, do, not, include, any, scrolling, text, on, your, site., Websites, that, have, things, constantly, moving, back, and, forth, on, the, screen, is, really,

efficiently., Your, tools, should, be, easy, to, access,, and, you, should, organize, your, work, space, to, concentrate, on, your, design., As, an, alternative, to, Photoshop,, you, could, choose, to, use, the, GIMP, photo, editor., GIMP, has, practically, every, single, feature, that, Adobe, Photoshop, does;, and, instead, of, spending, hundreds, of, dollars, on, a, program, and, using, up, a, few, hundred, MBs, of, program, space,, GIMP, is, 100%, free, and, runs, about, 35mb., Creativity, is, what, separates, ordinary, sites, from, the, extraordinary, ones,, so, never, be, afraid, to,

see, originality., They, wouldn’t, visit, your, site, at, all, if, they, wanted, the, same, old, stuff., If, you, are, making, multiple, pages, within, a, subcategory, of, a, website,, use, the, copy/paste, feature, on, your, PC,, it, will, help, a, lot!, Instead, of, writing, your, HTML, from, scratch, every, time,, use, the, shared, section, of, code, as, a, template, and, make, the, necessary, changes,, then, use, “save, as”, to, save, the, file, under, a, new, name., You, can, use, the, template, file, as, much, as, you, want., Keep, your, font, type, simple, on, your, website., Arial, or, Times, New, Roman, is, perfect, for, any, website., You, don’t, need, to, get, carried, away, with, bubble, letters, or, illegible, chicken, wings., Exotic, fonts, might, seem, cool, to, you,, but, your, visitors, are, going, to, have, a, tough, time, reading, your, site., Amazing, Facts, About, Jennifer, Lawrence, June, 10,, 2016, wickvegs, The, world, of, The, Hunger, Games, is, filled, with, many, interesting, names, though, some, are, a, bit, on, the, nose,, from, the, white-clad, President, “Snow”, to, a, baker, whose, name, is, a, homonym, for, “pita.”, However,, one, clever, name, goes, so, far, as, to, describe, the, entire, theme, of, the, series,, and, that’s, the, name, of, Suzanne, Collins’s, fictional, nation:, Panem., The, name, “Panem”, reflects, the, Latin, phrase, made, famous, by, Juvenal:, panem, et, circenses., The, phrase, translates, to, “bread, and, circuses,”, and, it, refers, to, how, the, Roman, government, distracted, suffering, farmers, with, public, games, and, spectacles., Of, course,, this, accurately, parallels, The, Hunger, Games, world, where, the, corrupt, Capitol, has, been, facing, increasing, unrest, and, placates, individuals, with, the, gory, spectacle, of, the, games., The, incentive, to, win, the, games, is,, among, other, things,, abundant, food, provided, by, the, Capitol, —, the, distant, hope, of, “bread”, to, drown, out, the, reality, of, mass, poverty, and, starvation., The, Hunger, Games:, Mockingjay–Part, 2, was, released, worldwide, in, November, 2015., However,, two, countries, notably, delayed, the, release, of, the, blockbuster, movie:, China, and, Thailand., Why, did, these, countries, do, this?, According, to, The, Washington, Post,, there, were, fears, that, Katniss, Everdeen’s, cry, for, rebellion, against, the, government, might, send, waves, far, beyond, the, silver, screen., For, example,, The, Post, suggests, Chinese, censors, feared, a, movie, where, a, young, woman, urges, the, poor,, oppressed, outer, colonies, to, rise, up, against, the, centralized, totalitarian, government, which, some, suggest, resembles, Beijing’s, relationship, with, its, own, distant, provinces., In, Thailand,, things, were, a, bit, more, obvious., Since, the, Thai, government, came, into, power, via, a, military, coup, in, early, 2014,, the, movie, has, served, as, a, rallying, call, for, protesters., Accordingly,, certain, Bangkok, cinemas, canceled, all, screenings, for, the, opening, weekend., Around, the, same, time,, other, protesters, were, arrested, for, flashing, the, three-fingered, salute, that, Katniss, famously, associated, with, solidarity, and, resistance, to, corrupt, governmental, forces., Unless, you’ve, seen, the, films,, it’s, difficult, to, explain, how, much, Donald, Sutherland’s, chilling, performance, as, the, ruthless, President, Snow, helps, to, sell, the, Capitol’s, decadence, and, the, dystopia, of, Panem., Interestingly, enough,, however,, Sutherland, was, already, becoming, this, character, well, before, he, was, cast!, After, reading, the, novels,, Sutherland, decided, he, wanted, the, role, and, pursued, it, in, a, very, unconventional, way., He, wrote, a, very, lengthy, letter, to, Gary, Ross, (director, of, the, first, Hunger, Games, movie), entitled, “Letters, from, the, Rose, Garden.”, The, letter, detailed, the, mentality, of, President, Snow, as, Sutherland, sees, it, —, that, absolute, power, has, not, made, him, a, “horny”, despot, but, instead, someone, who, channels, his, passion, into, his, rose, garden., In, Sutherland’s, letter,, he, made, many, connections, between, Panem, and, the, real, world,, from, his, own, fascination, with, the, Sterling, Silver, rose, of, the, 1970s, to, his, own, connection, with, Ted, Bundy., Sutherland, and, his, wife, were, driving, through, Colorado, when, Bundy, escaped, from, jail., Sutherland, recalled, the, radio, warnings, that, Bundy, looked, like, “the, nicest, young, man, imaginable.”, He, pictured, Snow, a, bit, like, that, —, someone, whose, evil, is, primarily, visible, in, his, eyes, but, who, appears, normal, and, nice,, a, threat, veiled, with, roses, and, smiles., Because, of, this, letter,, Sutherland, not, only, got, the, part,, but, Ross, added, scenes, of, Snow, in, his, rose, garden., This, motif, continued, throughout, the, next, three, Hunger, Games, films., And, despite, Ross, not, helming, the, remaining, movies,, the, omnipresent, threat, of, President, Snow, that, he, and, Sutherland, established, continued, to, loom, over, the, characters, and, the, audience, until, the, very, end, of, the, series., For, someone, playing, characters, who, are, often, tough-as-nails,, Jennifer, Lawrence, is, usually, imbued, with, that, intangible, girl-next-door, quality, that, gives, her, the, appearance, of, all-American, girl, innocence., Of, course,, that, makes, it, shocking, when, both, audiences, and, fellow, cast, members, find, out, how, much, she, loves, talking, dirty., Specifically,, Lawrence, is, well-known, for, her, foul, mouth, on, the, set, of, whatever, film, she’s, working, on., In, attempt, to, counteract, this,, Francis, Lawrence, (director, of, Mockingjay–Part, 1, and, Part, 2), instituted, a, swear, jar, on, set., Unfortunately,, it, didn’t, work., An, unnamed, cast, member, told, The, Sun, that, the, jar, had, done, nothing, to, keep, Lawrence’s, mouth, at, bay., In, fact,, she, keeps, the, jar, overflowing., One, of, the, more, controversial, techniques, in, the, modern, director’s, toolbox, is, the, use, of, the, infamous, “shaky, cam.”, While, ostensibly, intended, to, give, scenes, (particularly, action, scenes), jolts, of, jittery, realism,, the, end, result, is, often, a, confused, audience, who, can, barely, make, out, what’s, happening., The, first, Hunger, Games, movie, used, shaky, cam, extensively,, and, many, assumed, it, was, an, easy, answer, to, the, dilemma, of, basing, an, entire, movie, around, teens, murdering, each, other, and, still, getting, a, PG-13, rating., It, turns, out,, though,, that, there, was, a, method, behind, director, Gary, Ross’s, madness., Specifically,, he, intended, the, shaky, cam, to, make, audiences, feel, like, they, were, in, the, shoes, of, Katniss, Everdeen., In, the, novel,, Ross, felt, the, character, is, forced, into, a, kind, of, “serpentine, tunnel, vision”, in, order, to, survive,, and, that, author, Suzanne, Collins, did, this, to, further, “destabilize”, the, reader., Thus,, making, extensive, use, of, the, shaky, cam, helped, him, agitate, viewers, —, putting, them, “urgently”, in, her, point, of, view, —, while, making, them, feel, cut, off, from, the, comforts, of, the, real, world, as, they’re, forced, to, survive, right, alongside, Katniss., Jennifer, Lawrence, has, wowed, the, entire, world, with, her, consistent, quality, as, an, actress., She, can, channel, ruthless, daring, as, easily, as, passion, and, humor., All, of, this, acting, talent, at, such, a, young, age, is, no, small, feat, ., ., ., which, is, why, many, were, shocked, while, watching, The, Hunger, Games:, Mockingjay–Part, 1, to, discover, that, she, could, sing,, too!, In, the, movie,, Katniss, Everdeen, sings, an, a, cappella, song, titled, “The, Hanging, Tree.”, The, song, went, on, to, become, a, radio, hit, and, played, across, the, entire, world., The, punch, line, to, all, of, this, though, is, that, Jennifer, Lawrence, hates, singing,, and, she, particularly, hates, that, song., In, an, interview, for, HitFix.com,, Lawrence, described, singing, in, front, of, others, as, her, number, one, fear., She, also, said, that, when, filming, the, song,, she, was, shaking, and, wanted, her, mother., She, claims, that, whenever, she, watches, the, movies,, she, actually, plugs, her, ears, during, that, scene, so, she, does, not, have, to, hear, her, own, singing, voice.,
