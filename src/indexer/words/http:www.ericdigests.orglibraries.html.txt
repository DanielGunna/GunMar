-, This, document, is, from, 1996, and, is, written, by, Laura, A., Pinhey. , First, paragraph:, "Libraries, in, the, United, States, of, America, have, long, cultivated, democratic, environments., The, foundation, of, our, public, library, system, is, built, on, the, assumption, that, access, to, information, should, be, free, and, open, to, all., Indeed,, libraries, take, a, democratic, stance, toward, not, only, the, persons, they, serve,, but, also, toward, the, very, materials, they, provide:, to, offer, materials, representing, all, points, of, view, on, a, given, topic,, freedom, of, expression,, and, freedom, of, access, are, all, principles, of, library, philosophy., It, follows, that, libraries,, microcosms, of, democracy,, are, integral, to, a, truly, democratic, society." , 2. , Libraries, in, Today's, Digital, Age:, The, Copyright, Controversy, -, This, is, from, 2001, and, it, is, written, by, Carrie, Russell. , First, paragraph:, "Libraries, are, public, institutions, committed, to, equitable, access, and, the, free, flow, of, information, to, meet, the, needs, of, the, public., For, libraries,, copyright, law, -, through, its, incentive, model,, a, rich, and, robust, public, domain,, fair, use,, and, library, and, user, exemptions-aids, in, ensuring, that, information, is, both, created, and, made, accessible., While, digital, technologies, and, an, ever-, expanding, communication, network, infrastructure, have, enhanced, creation, and, wide, distribution, of, information, to, the, public,, these, same, technologies, can, be, used, to, control, or, restrict, public, access, to, information." , 3. , Small, Public, Libraries, Can, Serve, Big, -, This, is, from, 2001, and, is, written, by, Parry, Norm. , First, paragraph:, "Small, public, libraries, can, deliver, service, like, big, libraries,, without, sacrificing, hometown, warmth, and, charm., By, borrowing, strategies, used, by, successful, small, businesses, in, the, private, sector,, defining, goals, and, exploiting, ubiquitous, low, cost, technologies,, small, public, libraries, can, serve, customer, wants, as, well, as, much, larger, institutions., Responding, to, just, three, strategic, questions,, any, small, library, can, improve, customer, service,, make, better, use, of, available, resources, and, open, up, new, service, opportunities,, without, a, bigger, building,, budget, or, book, collection: , What, business, are, you, in?, What, do, your, customers, want?, How, do, you, get, it, for, them?" , 4. , Trends, and, Issue, in, Digital, Reference, Services, -, This, is, from, 2001, and, is, written, by, Abby, Kasowitz. , First, Paragraph:, "As, more, people, rely, on, the, Internet, for, information, and, less, people, approach, the, reference, desks, at, their, local, libraries, for, assistance, (Tenopir,, 2001;, Coffman, and, McGlamery,, 2000),, there, is, an, increased, need, for, formal, methods, of, remote, communication, between, information, seekers, and, information, professionals., Many, libraries, and, organizations, have, responded, to, this, need, by, providing, reference, service, via, the, Internet,, or, digital, reference, service,, to, their, users., Results, of, one, study, conducted, in, 1999, found, that, 45%, of, academic, libraries, (Janes,, Carter,, and, Memmott,, 1999), and, 13%, of, public, libraries, (Janes,, 2001), offered, digital, reference, services, through, e-mail, and, the, Web., A, later, study, found, that, 99%, of, 70, academic, libraries, offer, e-mail, reference, and, 29%, offer, real-time, reference, service, (Tenopir,, 2001)." , 5. , Total, Quality, Management, in, Libraries, -, This, is, from, 1996, and, is, written, by, Denise, Masters. , First, paragraph:, "In, the, 1950s,, the, Japanese, asked, W., Edwards, Deming,, an, American, statistician, and, management, theorist,, to, help, them, improve, their, war, torn, economy., By, implementing, Deming's, principles, of, total, quality, management, (TQM),, Japan, experienced, dramatic, economic, growth., In, the, 1980s,, when, the, United, States, began, to, see, a, reduction, in, its, own, world, market, share, in, relation, to, Japan,, American, business, rediscovered, Deming., Quality, management, experts,, Joseph, Juran, and, Philip, Crosby,, also, contributed, to, the, development, of, TQM, theories,, models,, and, tools., TQM, is, now, practiced, in, business, as, well, as, in, government,, the, military,, education,, and, in, non-profit, organizations, including, libraries, (Jurow, &, Barnard,, 1993)." , 6. , Library, Funding, -, This, is, from, 2001, and, is, written, by, Tracey, Bremer. , Opening, sentences:, "Library, funds, are, accumulated, from, a, mixture, of, local,, state,, federal,, and, other, sources., According, to, the, National, Center, for, Education, Statistics, (1997),, 77.6%, of, public, library, income, is, acquired, from, local, funds,, 12.1%, from, state, funds,, and, 0.9%, from, federal, funds., The, remaining, funds, (over, 9%), come, from, other, sources,, including, user, fees,, special, events,, and, private, fundraising, efforts, involving, foundations,, corporations,, individual, philanthropists,, and, "Friends, of, the, Library", groups., A, closer, look, at, each, source, will, target, current, issues, and, anticipated, trends, in, library, funding., Local, Taxes:, Public, libraries, today, acquire, the, bulk, of, their, funding, from, local, property, taxes., As, a, result,, the, local, economy, plays, a, major, role, in, their, budgetary, success, or, failure., Library, budgets, began, suffering, major, setbacks, during, the, 1970s,, but, rebounded, during, the, 1980s, and, early, 1990s., Currently,, however,, communities, often, fail, to, pass, local, tax, levies, (Burlingame,, 1995)." , 7. , Public, Library, Services, for, Homeschooling, -, This, is, from, 1996, and, is, written, by, Denise, Masters. , Key, paragraph:, "According, to, a, survey, of, Ohio, home, school, parents,, 99%, of, them, use, the, public, library, as, an, additional, resource, and, 73%, of, them, use, the, public, library, once, a, week, or, several, times, per, week., Books,, magazines,, the, librarian's, help,, video, and, audio, tapes,, reference, books,, and, programs, for, children, are, the, most, widely, used, services, (Schwartz,, 1991)., In, 1993-94,, Florida, had, 14,208, home, schoolers,, one, of, the, largest, numbers, in, the, nation., The, School, of, Library, and, Information, Science, at, the, University, of, South, Florida, perceived, "the, need, to, pool, the, ideas,, talents, and, experiences, of, children's, librarians", and, later, compiled, their, professional, observations, into, a, resource, for, other, librarians, who, "are, currently, grappling, with, the, challenge, of, how, to, serve, the, increasing, number, of, their, homeschooling, patrons", (Geist, et, al.,, 1994)." , 8. , Evaluation, of, World, Wide, Web, Sites:, An, Annotated, Bibliography, -, This, is, from, 1998, and, is, written, by, Kathleen, Schrock. , First, paragraph:, "Knowing, what, type, of, information, is, appropriate, for, particular, purposes,, knowing, how, to, find, such, information, easily,, and, evaluating, information,, may, be, called, information, literacy,, digital, literacy,, media, literacy,, or, techno-literacy., Paul, Gilster, best, defines, the, concept, in, his, book,, Digital, Literacy:, Digital, literacy, is, the, ability, to, understand, and, use, information, in, multiple, formats, from, a, wide, range, of, sources, when, it, is, presented, via, computers..., (Not), only, must, you, acquire, the, skill, of, finding, things,, you, must, also, acquire, the, ability, to, use, those, things, in, your, life., Acquiring, digital, literacy, for, Internet, use, involves, mastering, a, set, of, core, competencies., The, most, essential, of, these, is, the, ability, to, make, informed, judgments, about, what, you, find, on-line., (Gilster,, 1997)." , 9. , Building, and, Maintaining, Digital, Reference, Services, -, This, is, from, 1999, and, is, written, by, Joann, Wasik. , First, paragraph:, "Easily, accessible, digital, information, has, rapidly, become, one, of, the, hallmarks, of, the, Internet., Online, resources, have, surged, in, popularity, as, more, individuals, and, organizations, have, connected, to, the, global, network., Thousands, of, organizations, have, turned, to, Internet-based, information, delivery, as, an, effective, and, cost-efficient, alternative, to, traditional, communication, methods,, and, many, have, expanded, their, services, further, by, interacting, with, their, users, and, responding, to, inquiries, via, the, Internet." , 10. , Using, Critical, Thinking, to, Conduct, Effective, Searches, of, Online, Resources, -, This, is, from, 2000, and, is, written, by, Sarah, Brem. , First, paragraph:, "More, than, 80, percent, of, academic,, public, and, school, libraries, offer, some, form, of, Internet, access, (American, Library, Association,, 2000);, thousands, of, full-text, electronic, journals, and, serials, are, available, online., However,, most, searches, of, these, materials, are, cursory, and, ineffective(Hertzberg, &, Rudner,, 1999)., This, Digest, complements, guidelines, addressing, the, mechanics, of, online, searching, by, considering, how, treating, information, searches, as, exercises, in, critical, thinking, can, improve, our, use, of, online, resources., It, addresses, the, use, and, application, of, metacognition,, hypothesis, testing,, and, argumentation." , Other, ERIC, Digests, on, libraries,, librarians,, and, library, science:, - ,
