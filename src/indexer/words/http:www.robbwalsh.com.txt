local, English, fare., Here, is, her, latest, report:, Part, two, of, my, Mexican, Monday, adventures, ended, up, being, just, as, puzzling, as, the, first., One nice, thing, about, England, –, there’s, always, time, for, a, pint., There’s, a, perfectly, placed, Weatherspoon’s, across, the, street, from, the, local, grocery, store,, and,  boyfriend, and, I, have, fallen, into, the, routine, of, getting, a, pint, and, some, lunch, before, our, shop., Luckily, for, me,, our, normal, shopping, day, is, Monday,, so, I, was, able, to, once, again, try, a, Mexican, Monday, menu., This, time,, we, decided, to, split, the, basic, “Large, Nachos”, off, the, Sharers, part, of, the, normal, pub, menu, as, well, as, our, own, lunch, items., I, figured, I’d, have, better, luck, with, an, item, that’s, always, on, the, menu, versus, a, daily, special., The, first, thing, I, noticed, was, the, piles, of, toppings, along, the, chips., So, far,, I’m, not, sure, that, England, has, grasped, the, concept, of, nachos, being, completely, covered, all, over, in, the, good, stuff,, but, I, was, willing, to, forgive, it., The, next, thing, I, noticed, was, that,, once, again,, my, queso, was, no, bueno!, At, first, I, thought, that, they’d, forgotten, the, cheese, completely,, but, on, closer, inspection, I, found, it., If, you, can, even, call, this, cheese?, What, should, have, been, a, soft,, stretchy,, melty, goodness, had, been, baked, or, broiled, into, a, rock-solid, cement,, holding, all, of, the, chips, together, in, one, solid, puck, of, crunch., I, had, half, a, mind, to, march, down, to, the, bar, and, ask, them, if, they, knew, what, nachos, even, were!, At, one, point,, my, boyfriend, tried, to, pick, up, a, chip, on, the, edge, and, ended, up, with, the, entire, disc, up, in, the, air,, dropping, toppings, onto, the, plate, and, table., We, both, laughed, about, it,, but, our, smiles, faded, as, we, tried, to, break, off, pieces, to, scoop, up, the, toppings, with., We, were, either, breaking, off, crumb, sized, corners, or, big, blocks, of, four, chips, stuck, together,, and, the, whole, thing, was, getting, soggier, from, the, minute, from, the, large, piles, of, wet, toppings., It, was, just, a, mess., As, of, this, posting,, Mexican, Monday, at, Weatherspoon’s, no, longer, exists., With, the, luck, I, had, I’m, not, surprised, it’s, been, replaced, by, a, hot, dog, and, burger, menu., I’m, willing, to, admit, it, might, just, have, been, the, location, I, was, going, to, (I, realized, later, that, both, disastrous, orders, had, been, from, the, same, pub), but, I, have, to, say, that, Weatherspoon’s, hasn’t, impressed, me, with, their, Manx-Mex offerings., Oh, well! I’m, sure, I’ll, find, better, as, I, keep, looking., Share,

Tex-Mex, influences, on, the, local, English, fare., Here, is, her, latest, report:, On, one, rainy, afternoon, while, running, errands,, I, stopped, for, a, swift, pint, at, a, local, Weatherspoon’s,, which, is, a, chain, of, pubs, which, are, known, as, the, destination, for, “cheap, and, cheerful”. Imagine, my, surprise, when, I, saw, this, paper, placemat, on, the, table!, Nachos!, Quesadillas!, I, thought, I’d, hit, the, Manx-Mex jackpot!, But, alas, my, luck, was, not, to, be., I, ordered, off, the, Mexican, Monday, menu, on, two, separate, occasions,, and, I, have, to, say, that, both, experiences, were, sub-par., On, my, first, attempt,, I, ordered, the, BBQ, pulled, pork, and, cheese, quesadilla., (BBQ, pork, is, not, exactly, Tex-Mex,, but, it’s, a, definite, favorite, among, the, English, since, I, see, it, almost, everywhere!), The, plate, came, with, “Mexican-style”, rice, (I, think, we’d, call, it, Spanish, rice., Tomato-y, with, bits, of, onion, and, a, hint, of, cumin),, sour, cream,, salsa,, and, guacamole., I, was, pleased, to, see, some, good, looking, grill, marks, on, the, tortilla, and, eagerly, dove, into, my, food., The, rice, was, about, what, you’d, expect, for, mediocre Mexican, rice,, and, the, salsa, tasted, like, Picante, or, a, grocery, store, equivalent,, but, that, was, fine, with, me., The, guacamole, didn’t, disappoint, and, the, pepper, slices, on, it, made, me, smile., But, after, my, first, bite, into, the, quesadilla,, I, knew, something, was, terribly, wrong., I, opened, up, the, tortilla, to, see…, …no, cheese!, NO, CHEESE!, How, can, they, call, this, a, quesadilla, if, there’s, no, queso, to, it?!, I, checked, the, menu, again, to, make, sure, this, wasn’t, some, bastardized, spin, on, a, quesadilla,, but, the, text, confirmed, there, was, definitely, supposed, to, be, cheese, on, it., I, heaved, a, sigh, and, spread, my, condiments, over, the, pieces, to, try, and, save, it,, not, wanting, to, make, a, scene, at, the, bar, to, get, it, fixed., The, BBW, pork, was, nice, and, there, was, enough, in, the, tortilla,, bit, a, ‘dilla, is, just, a, ‘dilla, when, there’s, no, cheese., Tune, in, next, week,

 , The, interior, of, Chiquito’s, is, a, decidedly, Mexican, mixture, of, festive, and, relaxed., Beer, bottle, chandeliers, (using, only, bottles, from, Dos, Equis, and, Corona,, of, course!), light, up, piles, of, straw, sombreros, that, are, strewn, everywhere, for, guests, to, wear, and, take, selfies, in., They’re, especially, popular, with, the, kids.,  , My, Manchester, Chimichanga, was served, in, a, suitably, English, fryer, basket, of, chips, (or, fries,, if, you’re, from, America), with, guacamole,, salsa,, and, sour, cream, on, the, side., (The, name, means, “thing-a-ma-jing.”), It, was, filled, with, Mexican-style, rice,, beans,, “jalapenos, cheese, sauce”, (a, distant, relative, of, queso), and, melted, mozzarella, with, a, choice, of, meat, (chicken,, chili, beef,, or, BBQ, pulled, pork), or, habanero, mushrooms., I, decided, to, try, the, habanero, mushrooms and, was, delighted, by, the, decent, kick, of, heat, I, got, from, them., Besides, the, infamous, curries,, I, thought, that, this, was, the, land, of, the, bland!, Always, delighted, to, be, proven, wrong., Note, from, Robb:, Though, it, was, actually, invented, in, Tucson,, Arizona;, the, chimichanga,, which, is, essentially, a, deep-fried, burrito,, is, lumped, into, the, Tex-Mex, category, by, many, Americans, and, most, Europeans., The, Manchester, version, pictured, here, is,

common, Tex-Mex, dish, in, England–they, are, front, and, center, on, the, pub, grub, Hall, of, Fame., But, my, first, taste, of, English, nachos, wasn’t, very, inspiring., On, the, menu, they, were, described, as, being, “stacked, high, and, covered, in, jalapeño, cheese, sauce,, jalapeño, peppers,, melted, mozzarella,, sour, cream”, and, then, topped, with, my, choice, of, either, salsa, and, guacamole,, or, chorizo, and, cranberry, salsa, (huh?)., I, chose, the, more, traditional of, the, two,, wanting, to, stick, to, a, more, authentic, Texas, taste, for, my, first, try.,  , When, the, nachos, hit, the, table,, I, was, baffled., Nachos, in, a, bowl?!, The, slightly, scorched chips, were, standing, upright, in, a, funnel-shaped, bowl, with, all, of, the, toppings, piled, on, top., By, the, time, I, was, finished, taking, pictures,, they, were, half, way, to, soggy.,  The, chips, I, was, able, to, pick, up, and, eat, tasted, good,, though, it, was, a, challenge, to, keep, any, of, the, toppings, on, them, as, the, slightly, sodden tortilla, chips, collapsed, under, the, weight, of, all, those, toppings., Other, than, that,, they, weren’t, bad,, and, the, combination, of,
