[SFScene, Wanna, know, what's, what, in, the, San, Francisco, dance, scene?, Upcoming, events,, reviews,, mix, downloads, and, scenester, gossip, from, the, jaded, gay, DJ, Tuesday,, August, 2,, 2011, Event, Review:, Dore, Alley, Fair, A, few, weeks, ago, Baltimore's, Dan, Rodricks, interviewed, Elijah, Anderson, about, his, new, book, The, Cosmopolitan, Canopy:, Race, and, Civility, in, Everyday, Life, on, local, NPR, affiliate, WYPR., The, main, thesis, of, Anderson's, book, is, that, it, is, the, cosmopolitan, canopy,, those, spaces, where, all, races, and, classes, of, a, city, mix,, and, agree, to, act, civil, toward, one, another,, that, provide, the, true, social, fabric, of, a, city., As, I, listened, to, this, interview,, and, the, attempts, by, Rodricks, and, callers, to, name, such, spaces, in, Baltimore,, I, thought,, well,, in, San, Francisco,, we, call, them, street, fairs., From, How, Weird, to, the, Castro, Street, Fair,, each, provides, an, opportunity, for, a, neighborhood, to, invite, the, rest, of, the, city, to, have, a, visit,, socialize,, have, some, food, and, drink,, and, maybe, dance, a, little, while, soaking, in, some, of, the, unique, "atmosphere", of, the, neighborhood., As, I, walked, around, Dore, Alley, Street, Fair, this, past, Sunday,, I, realized, that, I, could, not, find, a, better, example, of, how, the, cosmopolitan, canopy, of, the, street, fair, brings, all, of, San, Francisco, together, in, a, way, that, only, this, city, really, can., Let's, be, honest:, Dore, Alley, is, FREAKY,, and, there, are, things, both, wonderful, and, terrible, to, be, seen., But, I, think, it's, a, mark, of, being, a, San, Franciscan, that, one, can, wander, into, that, scene,, with, perhaps, only, the, slightest, notion, of, what, a, "fetish, fair", might, be,, and, think,, oh,, there, are, some, naked, guys,, and, over, there, someone, is, pretending, to, a, dog,, and,, wow,, the, sound, of, that, whip, is, really, loud,, and, it's, all, just, another, day, in, the, city., There, are, many, people, who, would, take, that, as, the, very, mark, of, how, deviant, and, decadent, Sodom, by, the, Bay, has, become,, but, for, me,, it's, a, mark, of, what, is, truly, special, about, "San, Francisco, Values:", we, judge, people, not, by, how, weird, or, freaky, they, are,, but, by, things, that, really, count,, like, the, strength, of, you, character., So, you, like, to, spend, some, time, running, around, on, all, fours, and, barking,, yeah,, whatever, --, are, you, someone, I, can, count, on, when, I, really, need, you?, As, a, city,, we, also, have, a, vast, tolerance, for, difference,, because, we're, almost, all, people, who, have, come, here, because, we, were, so, very,, very, different, in, the, places, we, lived, before., Dore, Alley, Fair, is, an, event, where, people, from, all, over, the, city, come, together,, and, whatever, our, differences, in, race,, gender,, class,, ethnicity,, etc.,, we, can, be, civil, to, one, another, because, we, don't, just, tolerate, difference,, we, encourage, it, in, full, display., For, me,, Dore, Alley, was, also, a, deeply, personal, reminder, of, why, I, came, back, to, San, Francisco., I, went, down, there, with, no, particular, plans,, no, crew,, and, spent, the, afternoon, wandering, around,, running, into, friends,, hanging, out, for, while,, running, off, again,, finding, more, friends,, repeat, repeat, repeat., It, was, the, best, experience, of, "community", I've, had, in, a, really, long, time,, because, I, could, feel, how, I, connected,, in, so, many, different, ways,, to, this, gathering, of, people., In, some, ways, the, big, party, aspect, of, Dore, Alley, Fair, was, far, less, important, to, me, than, this, ability, to, just, have, a, spontaneous,, serendipitous, experience, of, being, part, of, something, much, larger, than, myself., Posted, by, The, Jaded, Gay, DJ, at, 9:56, PM, No, comments:, Email,

Joy's, "Active, Touch,", July, 29,, 2011, A, few, weeks, ago, I, read, a, post, on, Facebook, in, which, someone, was, responding, to, the, closing, of, The, Eagle, by, complaining, that, the, gay, bar/club, scene, "just, wasn't, the, same, anymore,", how, it, had, become, boring, and, predictable,, homogeneous,, lost, its, cruise/sleaze, factor,, etc., While, in, my, original, post, about, the, closing, of, the, Eagle, I, pointed, out, that, things, change,, and, perhaps, it, was, time, to, think, about, a, "new, gay", as, opposed, to, waxing, nostalgic, about, the, "old, gay,", events, like, Comfort, and, Joy's, "Active, Touch", demonstrate, quite, well, that, there, is, a, thriving,, exciting,, gay, scene, alive, and, well, in, San, Francisco,, with, all, the, sleaze, and, craziness, you, could, want,, if, you, just, take, the, time, to, go, looking, for, it., This, is,, to, the, best, of, my, hazy, recollection,, the, fourth, or, fifth, year, that, Comfort, and, Joy, has, been, throwing, the, Touch, parties,, usually, in, conjunction, with, a, major, holiday, or, event,, in, this, case,, Dore, Alley., While, the, parties, serve, on, the, practical, level, as, fundraisers, for, Comfort, and, Joy's, annual, excursions, onto, the, playa,, they, also, provide, a, glimpse, into, a, "new, gay", underground, scene., Inspired, in, large, part, originally, by, John, Cameron, Mitchell's, film, "Short, Bus,", Comfort, and, Joy, events, evoke, the, vibe, of, the, 70s, bath-house,, where, you, can, cruise,, dance,, see, some, inspired, performances,, and, connect, with, a, community, that, is, truly, creating, something, new,, rather, than, trying, to, hold, onto, the, past., Comfort, and, Joy, parties, have, provided, a, platform, for, musicians,, DJs,, drag, divas,, and, visual, artists, like, Honey, Sound, System,, the, House, of, Herrera,, the, House, of, Salad,, III,, and, many, others,, and, serve, as, a, nexus, for, queers, of, all, shapes,, sizes,, and, varieties, to, cum,, er,, come, together., I, must, admit, that,, for, this, particular, event,, I, didn't, really, have, the, energy, to, devote, to, a, full-scale, party., I, went, primarily, to, connect, with, friends, and, a, community, that, I, haven't, been, part, of, in, a, while,, and, in, that, regard,, it, was, a, blowout, -, I, heard, the, words, "welcome, home", so, many, times, that, it, convinced, me, that, I, really, was, "home.", If, I'd, had, a, bit, more, spunk, in, my, junk, I, could, have, certainly, found, any, number, of, amusing, divertisements, to, keep, me, occupied, until, the, closing, bell, at, 4AM,, since, there, was, a, dancefloor, (though,, admittedly,, I, am, not, that, great, a, fan, of, Bus, Station, John's, retro, disco, sound),, a, "gentleman's, boudoir,", a, tiki, lounge,, and, any, number, of, small, niches, where, one, could, locate, oneself, for, conversation, or, other, social, interactions., It, was, enough, for, me,, though,, to, just, feel, like, I, had, found, myself, back, among, a, community, that,, like, a, family,, has, its, fractious, and, dysfunctional, aspects,, but, are, the, still, people, with, whom, feels, that, special,, intimate, connection., I'll, take, that, over, being, groped, at, The, Powerhouse, any, day., Posted, by, The, Jaded, Gay, DJ, at, 3:31, PM, No, comments:, Email, ThisBlogThis!Share, to, TwitterShare, to, FacebookShare, to, Pinterest, Labels:, Active, Touch,, Comfort, and, Joy,, Event, Review, Event, Review:, Honey, Soundsystem, 4, Year, Anniversary, at, Holy, Cow, I, signed, a, lease, on, a, shared, space, in, the, Castro, last, Saturday,, and, ever, since, then, it's, been, a, whirlwind, of, moving,, cleaning,, setting, up,, and, dreaming, of, the, future., There, have, also, been, some, moments, of, pure, anxiety,, as, I, contemplate, the, ratio, of, expenses, to, savings, and, how, long, the, latter, will, last, without, a, job, to, replenish, it., It's, a, good, thing,, then,, that, the, Honey, Soundsystem, 4, Year, Anniversary, party, at, Holy, Cow, came, around, at, just, the, right, moment, to, remind, me, of, why, I, moved, back, to, San, Francisco., Honey, Soundsystem, first, came, to, my, attention, by, way, of, Marke, B., of, the, Bay, Guardian's, Super, Ego, column., We, had, been, having, an, email, exchange, about, techno, in, the, SF, music, scene,, and, he, told, me, I, should, check, out, this, DJ, PeePlay, and, his, comrade-in-arms, Jason, Kendig., And, then,, just, about, the, same, time,, Kitten, Calfee, of, Comfort, and, Joy, told, me, he'd, been, contacted, by, this, group, calling, themselves, Honey, Soundsystem, about, playing, at, an, Afterglow, party., Did, I, know, anything, about, them,, and, could, I, recommend, them?, And, that,, as, they, say,, is, how, history, is, made., Checking, out, the, posters, for, past, Honey, events, at, the, party, reminded, me, of, what, I, have, always, appreciated, about, them:, they, focus, on, the, music, and, creating, a, big, open, vibe, for, everyone,, rather, than, playing, to, the, typical, marketing, ploys,, usually, based, on, identity, stereotypes,, of, other, club, promoters., Honey, Soundsystem, has, never, put, a, guy, on, their, flyers,, never, proclaimed, that, their, parties, are, for, this, type,, or, that, one,, but, for, everyone., You, could, see, the, effect, of, this, at, the, party, -, there, were, club, kids, and, "mature, elders", like, me,, bears, and, twinks,, Asians, and, Latins,, women, and, drag, queens,, all, there, because, they, wanted, to, go, out, and, have, a, good, time, on, the, dancefloor, with, each, other., Which, brings, me, around, to, the, music:, while, I, have, not, always, grooved, on, every, musical, orientation, of, Honey, Soundsystem,, these, are, guys, who, always, care, deeply, about, the, music, they, play,, and, who, go, out, of, their, way, to, use, the, music, to, create, something, that, is, a, true, expression, of, their, ethos., You, can, go, to, any, bar, or, club, in, the, Castro, and, consume, pre-digested, pop, dance, pablum,, but, Honey, Soundsystem, will, always, feed, your, ears, and, your, soul, with, something, substantial, and, carefully, cultivated., On, this, particular, night,, the, sound, had, a, distinct, acid/retro, house, feel,, and, as, I, danced, for, the, first, time, in, months,, on, a, dance, floor, full, of, shiny, happy, people,, I, had, a, flashback, to, some, of, the, great, Sunday, night, parties, of, the, past,, like, Pleasuredome, at, King, Street, Garage,, or, the, tea, dance, at, The, End, Up., Sunday, night, is, always, a, special, time, in, clubland,, a, time, when, those, who, have, a, different, relation, to, the, workweek, come, out, and, party,, but, it's, also, a, night, when, you're, not, necessarily, looking, for, the, peak, experience, of, a, Friday, or, Saturday., In, this, case,, Honey, hit, that, sweet, spot, (oh, man,, I, can't, believe, I, wrote, that),, between, uplifting, and, groovy, that,, for, me,, has, always, defined, the, essence, of, a, good, Sunday, night, out., I, shook, it, loose, for, about, two, hours,, had, a, nice, conversation, about, the, Hawaiian, lifestyle, with, a, couple, of, very, friendly, guys, on, the, back, porch,, and, re-connected, with, some, old, friends, before, I, finally, gave, in, to, exhaustion, and, headed, out, the, door, around, 12.30., At, that, point,, the, club, was, packed, and, there, was, a, line, that, looked, like, something, out, of, Satyricon, stretching, down, the, sidewalk,, so, I'm, sure, the, festivities, kept, up, well, until, last, call., Honey, Sundays, at, Holy, Cow, is, going, onto, my, list, of, San, Francisco, Essentials,, things, you, must, do, when, you're, in, the, city., And, to, PeePlay,, Kendig,, Robot, Hustle,, and, Ken, Vulsion,, my, thanks, for, reminding, me, of, what, makes, this, a, great, city,, and, why, it's, worth, whatever, it, takes, to, be, here., Long, Live, Honey!, Check, out, the, weekly, Honey, Potcast, for, a, taste, of, Honey, and, special, guests., Posted, by, The, Jaded,

2011, Hey, Bitches,, I'm, Back!, Hello, San, Francisco,, good, to, see, you,, it's, been, too, long., I've, been, back, in, The, City, for, about, a, week, now,, and, walking, around,, not, much, seems, to, have, changed, in, the, two, years, I've, been, gone., Checking, out, club, posters, in, the, Castro, yesterday, I, saw, many, of, the, same, names,, and, same, concepts,, that, were, on, those, posters, when, I, left,, and, my, traditional, watering, holes, had, many, of, the, same, faces, on, both, sides, of, the, bar., But, if, not, much, has, changed, in, the, material, world, of, gay, SF, during, my, exile, years, (putting, aside, the, frankly, confusing, demise, of, The, Eagle),, I've, been, making, the, effort, over, the, past, few, days, to, adjust, my, perceptual, apparatus,, to, calibrate, it, back, to, that, state, when, I, first, came, to, San, Francisco, in, 1999,, and, perhaps, see, the, same, things, differently., When, I, first, came, to, San, Francisco,, fresh, out, of, grad, school, and, as, desperately, glad, to, be, out, of, Atlanta, as, I, am, to, be, out, of, Baltimore, now,, there, was, a, glamor, that, radiated, from, everyone, and, everything,, and, cast, a, spell, of, enchantment, over, me., For, a, while, I, was, able, to, give, up, on, being, the, skeptical,, cynical, East, Coast, intellectual, and, simply, be, enthralled, by, the, spirit, of, the, City,, to, find, it, all, quite, marvelous, and, fascinating., Over, time,, of, course,, those, perceptions, changed,, and, it, was, difficult,, particularly, by, the, time, I, left,, to, not, find, the, rot, at, the, center, of, the, bloom., Whether, or, not, I, can, find, a, way, to, throw, wide, the, doors, of, perception, again,, returning, to, a, place, should, not, also, automatically, entail, a, return, to, the, same, modes, of, being,, falling, back, into, the, same, comfortable, attitudes, and, ideas., There, are, some, mistakes, I, think, I, made, during, my, last, residence, in, SF,, and, some, things, I've, had, ample, opportunity, to, ruminate, upon, during, cold,, dark, nights, in, the, Baltimore, winter., I, came, back, to, San, Francisco, not, necessarily, to, pick, up, where, I, left, off,, but, to, try, and, strike, out, in, a, way, that's, substantially, new., I, haven't, really, decided, what, to, do, with, this, blog, yet,, whether, the, way, it, focuses, my, attention,, and, upon, what,, is, something, that, that, will, ultimately, help, or, hinder, my, efforts, in, trying, to, find, this, new, direction,, but,, for, a, little, while, at, least,, it, continues, to, give, me, a, good, excuse, for, going, out, and, seeing, what, there, is, to, see., Posted, by, The, Jaded, Gay, DJ, at, 11:13, PM, No, comments:, Email, ThisBlogThis!Share, to, TwitterShare, to, FacebookShare, to, Pinterest, Labels:, A, Dog's, Life, Sunday,, June, 26,, 2011, Event, Review:, Rich, Morel's, Hot, Sauce, at, Grand, Central, (Baltimore), Rich, Morel,, of, Blow, Off, fame,, brought, Hot, Sauce, to, Grand, Central, in, Baltimore, last, night,, and, I, had, one, of, my, best, nights, on, the, dance, floor, in, a, very, long, while,, with, swollen, knees, to, attest, to, that, fact, this, morning., Morel, played, a, high-energy, set, of, electro-inflected, dance, music, that, included, some, great, sing-along, opportunities, with, remixes, of, tracks, like, Oasis', "Wonder, Wall", and, Depeche, Mode's, "Personal, Jesus,", along, with, plenty, of, the, typical, four-on-the-floor, tracks, you'd, hear, at, any, good, dance, party., At, one, point, I, found, myself, thinking, back, to, my, first, gay, clubbing, experiences, in, the, mid-80s, at, places, like, the, now-defunct, Traxx, in, DC,, where, synth, pop, met, Hi-NRG, and, there, were, always, plenty, of, hands, in, the, air., That, was, the, case, at, Hot, Sauce, as, well,, by, 11.30, the, dancefloor, was, jumpin', and, jivin,', and, when, I, left, a, little, after, 1AM, there, was, still, enough, of, a, crowd, to, ensure, it, would, keep, going, until, last, call., Given, that, the, logo, for, the, Hot, Sauce, party, is, a, cowboy, riding, a, bucking, bear,, you, might, have, some, idea, of, what, to, expect, from, the, crowd,, and, sure, enough,, it, was, predominately, older,, large, of, size,, and, ample, of, body, and, facial, hair., By, midnight, there, was, some, greater, diversity, to, the, crowd,, and, I, even, ran, into, a, lesbian, of, my, acquaintance,, Pam,, who,, like, me,, was, looking, more, for, an, opportunity, to, dance, on, a, Saturday, night, than, anything, else., Still,, as, a, guy, who, would, have, been, considered, a, twink, until, I, started, going, gray, and, blind,, and, remains, pretty, small, and, possessed, of, about, the, same, amount, of, body, hair, as, I, had, when, I, was, 16,, I, had, a, hard, time, figuring, out, how, to, relate, to, this, scene., I, certainly, enjoyed, Morel's, set,, but, for, all, the, other, considerations, of, why, I, might, go, out, to, a, gay, dance, night,, I, might, as, well, have, been, invisible., I, even, had, a, slight, moment, of, hesitation, when, I, took, off, my, shirt, on, the, dancefloor;, plenty, of, other, guys, had, already, done, it,, and, there, was, a, lot, of, tactile, admiration, of, Buddha, bellies, and, pelts, going, on, as, a, result,, but, I, actually, had, a, moment, of, wondering, "Is, this, okay?", I, have,, in, the, past,, heard, some, rather, unkind, remarks, about, twinks, issuing, from, the, muzzles, of, bears,, and, I, wondered, whether, taking, my, shirt, off, in, this, club,, with, this, crowd,, would, be, taken, as, provocation,, or,, even, worse,, would, mark, me, out, as, a, target, for, scorn, because, I, don't, fit, into, this, particular, scene's, image, of, masculinity., I, thought, about, this, for, a, second, and, then, decided, well,, if, anybody, has, a, problem, with, it,, fuck, them,, I, came, to, dance,, and, I, would, hope, that, my, obvious, enthusiasm, for, the, music, and, the, energy, of, the, party, would, be, of, greater, importance, than, the, accidents, of, genetics, that, made, me, the, way, I, am., I, admit, that, I, continue, to, struggle, with, the, whole, idea, of, a, "bear, movement", and, with, bears, as, a, separate, subculture, of, the, gay, scene., I, understand, where, that, subculture, comes, from,, and, I'm, generally, sympathetic, to, attempts, to, create, alternatives, to, hegemonic, mainstream, culture, of, any, type,, gay, or, straight., I, also, cannot, fault, anyone, for, their, attractions,, and, if, bears, aren't, attracted, to, me,, that's, okay,, because, I'm, not, particularly, attracted, to, them, (though, I, have, noticed, that, it, has, become, increasingly, "incorrect", in, larger, gay, culture, to, admit, that, you're, attracted, to, twinks,, or, nelly, guys,, or, anything, that, isn't, in, keeping, with, a, fairly, conservative, notion, of, masculinity)., But, it, does, bug, me, that,, like, so, much, of, mainsteam, straight, culture,, gay, culture, forms, itself, around, body, types,, and, those, body, types, are, taken, to, be, the, signifiers, of, a, shared, set, of, values., This,, in, the, end,, can, make, the, most, revolutionary, movement, just, another, exercise, in, conformity,, and, enforces, separatism, at, the, level, of, phenotype, when, the, real, shared, values, exist, at, a, much, deeper, level., I, have, always, believed, that, the, dance, scene, has, the, ability, to, bring, people, together, through, a, shared, physical, and, emotional, experience,, and, that, a, good, DJ,, like, Rich, Morel,, knows, how, to, create, that, experience., I, was, happy, last, night, to, share, the, dancefloor, with, big, guys, bumpin', bellies,, two, geeky, Asian, boys, dancing, together,, a, very, drunk, Latino, exotic, dancer,, at, least, one, drag, queen,, and, my, lesbian, friend, Pam., I, can, only, wish, that, that, the, intention, had, been, to, create, that, shared, experience, for, the, diversity, of, people, I, saw, there,, rather, than, one, exclusive, group.,

Sauce,, Other, Scenes,, Rich, Morel, Monday,, April, 11,, 2011, The, Endangered, Eagle, Word, has, reached, me, via, Facebook, about, the, threatened, closing, of, the, San, Francisco, Eagle,, and, over, at, Joe.My.God, there, is, an, unsourced, rendering, of, what, is, planned, for, the, future., Aesthetically, and, culturally, pleasing, it, is, not., I, have, written, before, about, what, a, great, institution, the, beer, bust, is,, and, on, many, a, dull, Sunday, afternoon, in, Baltimore, I, have, had, wistful, thoughts, of, drinkings, and, doings, on, the, Eagle, patio,, and, looked, forward, to, experiencing, it, again, upon, my, return., I, hope, that, a, plan, of, action, to, save, it, will, come, out, of, tonight's, meeting,, whether, through, having, it, designated, a, historic, landmark, (one, can, only, imagine, the, plaque, for, that),, it, being, purchased,, or, a, a, bunch, of, rowdy, queers, chaining, themselves, to, the, toilets, like, in, the, good, old, days, to, defy, the, wrecking, ball., However,, I, think, a, larger, lesson, that, must, be, taken, from, this, is, that, the, SF, gay, community, has, to, learn, to, adapt, to, a, changing, world, in, order, to, survive., Many, have, bemoaned, the, passing, of, the, leather, bars, and, bathhouses, that, lined, Folsom, some, thirty, years, ago,, but, what, made, all, that, possible, was, that, SoMa, was, a, marginal, zone, of, low, property, values., As, many, have, pointed, out,, the, new, boom, and, the, coming, of, companies, like, Twitter, and, Zynga, have, brought, up, property, values, in, SoMa,, and, for, whoever, owns, the, land, on, which, the, Eagle, sits,, I'm, sure, there, are, much, more, lucrative, opportunities, than, leasing, to, a, gay, bar., This, gentrification,, if, you, will,, of, SoMa,, is, a, ruthless,, uncaring, process, driven, by, pure, capitalism,, and, no, one, will, be, happy, to, see, what, it, does, to, the, treasured, institutions, and, watering, holes, of, the, past, (see,, for, example,, my, post, about, the, controversy, over, the, re-location, of, The, Hole, in, the, Wall)., By, enlisting, the, aid, of, the, city, it, might, be, possible, to, win, some, battles,, but, the, overall, trend, of, the, war, is, clear,, and, if, the, gay, community, is, going, to, survive,, it, must, learn, how, to, adapt, to, the, new, conditions, it, faces,, rather, than, mourn, its, losses., I've, seen, many, comments, on, this, situation, that, take, a, very, traditionalist, stance;, this, is, what, was,, this, is, what, must, be,, and, development, must, be, opposed, at, all, costs., As, a, Southerner,, and, someone, who, has, lived, in, many, places, where, the, populace, has, linked, arms, against, any, change, or, development, in, the, name, of, the, past,, I, can, tell, you, that, what, this, ultimately, brings, is, economic, ruin., You, cannot, keep, the, San, Francisco, of, the, 1970s, or, 1980s;, however, golden, those, years, might, have, been, in, some, ways,, they, were, also, very, lean, years,, when, San, Francisco, had, serious, economic, problems., That's, what, made, it, cheap, to, live, there,, that's, what, makes, it, cheap, to, live, in, Baltimore,, but, I, don't, think, many, San, Franciscans, want, to, live, in, a, city, where, block, after, block, of, downtown, is, boarded, up, and, abandoned,, as, SoMa, was, during, this, time, and, as, Baltimore, is, now., The, economic, boom, of, the, 90s, revitalized, San, Francisco, in, as, many, ways, as, it, created, new, problems,, as, in, the, case, of, The, Eagle., I'm, coming, back, to, San, Francisco, because, of, the, energy, of, the, city,, the, opportunity, it, presents,, and, the, kind, of, people, who, live, there,, so, I, want, to, see, it, grow, and, prosper., But, I, also, want, to, see, it, keep, the, character, of, what, makes, it, San, Francisco,, and, for, that, to, happen,, there, must, be, adaptation., So, SoMa, is, not, what, it, was, in, the, 1970s, --, find, the, new, marginal, space,, work, with, the, city, to, keep, gentrification, from, encroaching, upon, it,, and, create, the, new, SoMa., Instead, of, trying, to, hold, back, the, tide, and, crying, over, what, was, lost,, look, ahead, and, create, the, new., If, the, The, Eagle, is, sold,, find, a, new, space,, because, what, makes, The, Eagle, isn't, the, building,, it's, the, people, who, come, and, create, the, space, of, a, community., UPDATE:, Courtesy, of, SFWeekly,, a, report, on, last, night's, rally, at, The, Eagle,, which, fills, in, this, unpleasant, detail:, But, before, that, deal, could, go, through,, the, owner, of, the, property, decided, he, wanted, to, start, a, bar, there, himself,, and, wouldn't, allow, the, current, owners, to, transfer, the, lease., "He, saw, an, opportunity, to, start, his, own, business, here,", Thirkield, said., "He, blew, up, that, entire, deal.", Now,, the, Eagle, has, been, given, notice, to, shut, down, by, the, owner,, reportedly, a, thirtysomething, resident, of, Santa, Rosa, who, inherited, the, property, from, family.So, what, truly, sucks, about, this, is, that, someone, from, outside, the, city,, who, seems, to, have, no, experience, with, a, bar,, and, likely, has, no, understanding, of, the, cultural, landscape,, is, going, to, try, and, start, a, straight, bar, in, a, spot, that, has, no, foot, traffic,, and, is, well, away, from, other, bars, or, businesses, that, will, support, it., This, means, that, it,, like, The, Eagle,, must, be, a, destination, bar., But, note, that, the, Skylark,, which, is, owned, by, the, person, the, property, owner, intends, to, turn, the, location, over, to,, which, is, on, the, heavily, trafficked, 16th, Street,, was, empty, on, a, Monday, night, when, the, protesters, showed, up., Put, all, this, together,, and, I, can, almost, guarantee, that, whatever, they, put, in, there, will, fail, within, a, year,, especially, given, the, certain, negative, publicity, the, bar, will, receive., So,, some, dunderhead, is, going, to, rip, out, a, chunk, of, the, gay, cultural, landscape, of, San, Francisco, for, what, will, likely, wind, up, being, a, failed, business, folly, -, somehow, it, would, be, better, if, The, Eagle, was, going, to, razed, for, condos, rather, than, subjected, to, this, indignity., Posted, by, The, Jaded, Gay, DJ, at, 5:24, PM, No, comments:, Email, ThisBlogThis!Share, to, TwitterShare, to, FacebookShare, to, Pinterest, Labels:, gay, scene,, Scene, News, and, Politics,, The, Eagle, Saturday,, March, 19,, 2011, Event, Review:, Proper, at, Dionysus, (Baltimore), Last, night, was, the, first, taste, of, Spring, we've, had, in, Baltimore, after, a, looooong,, cold, winter,, and, there, was, a, clearly, festive, spirit, in, the, air, as, I, wandered, around, Mt., Vernon., After, seeing, Jacques, Tatti's, The, Illusionist, at, The, Charles, (a, film, very, much, in, the, spirit, of, Jean, Renoir),, I, ambled, over, to, Dionysus, to, have, a, beer, and, discovered, that, a, DJ, night,, Proper,, was, shortly, getting, underway, in, the, upstairs, bar., I, had, a, couple, beers, downstairs, while, things, warmed, up,, and, then, proceeded, through, the, secret, door, to, discover, a, very, "proper", house, night, indeed,, one, that, had, a, very, lively,, and, friendly,, underground, vibe., When, I, first, sat, down, at, the, bar, there, was, a, conversation, underway, about, the, origins, of, rap,, sparked, by, the, passing, of, Nate, Dogg, earlier, this, week,, that, was, straight, out, of, High, Fidelity., I, wound, up, talking, with, the, bartender, for, a, bit,, as, well, as, the, fellow, sitting, next, to, me, who, told, me, his, girl, had, just, left, him,, and, that, he, once, had, been, addicted, to, crack,, but, now, had, cleaned, things, up, and, owned, two, restaurants., A, tattoo, of, barbed, wire, strands, wrapped, around, his, left, forearm,, and, I, think, (I, can't, be, sure, because, it, was, dark, and, the, brim, of, a, cap, was, pulled, down, low, on, his, forehead), he, was, wearing, something, sparkly, at, the, corners, of, his, eyes., I, turned, him, on, to, Strongbow, Cider, and, we, commiserated, about, broken, hearts, and, making, music., Clearly,, Proper, attracts, an, interesting, crowd,, and, I, saw, everything, from, blissed, out, hipster, kids, to, girls, in, cocktail, dresses., While, standing, on, the, edge, of, the, dancefloor, a, guy, asked, me, "what, do, you, think, of, this?", and, I, said, "It's, great,, no, douchebags.", Really,, what, more, do, I, need, to, say?, The, tunes, were, on, the, pop, side, early, in, the, evening,, when, I, heard, the, likes, of, Michael, Jackson, and, Radiohead, remixes,, before, it, settled, into, nice, smooth, flow, of, house, (of, course,, it, helps, to, keep, the, flanger, on, in, smoothing, out, those, mixes), that, was, moving, people, out, onto, the, dancefloor., I, left, around, midnight,, as, I'd, had, my, fill, of, beer, and, was, looking, forward, to, other, weekend, activities,, but, I, will, definitely, be, back, to, check, this, scene, out, properly., Posted, by, The, Jaded, Gay, DJ, at, 10:58, AM, No, comments:, Email, ThisBlogThis!Share, to, TwitterShare, to, FacebookShare, to, Pinterest, Labels:, Baltimore,, dionysus,, Other, Scenes,, Proper, Friday,, March, 18,, 2011, The, Early, Days, of, Baltimore, Club, On, WYPR's, "Maryland, Morning", show, this, past, Wednesday, there, was, an, interview, with, one, of, the, early, Baltimore, Club, DJs,, DJ, Equalizer,, about, the, scene, back, in, the, early, to, mid-90s,, when, it, seem, that, things, were, really, hopping., What, I, found, most, interesting, was, Equalizer's, statement, that,, when, he, left, the, city, for, about, five, years,, starting, in, 1995,, and, came, back,, everything, was, gone., I've, heard, this, from, a, lot, of, people, I've, talked, to, about, the, dance, scene, in, Bmore,, that, through, the, mid-to-late, 90s, there, was, a, very, strong, house/club, music, presence,, but, then, it, all, suddenly, dried, up., I've, not, heard, a, good, explanation, of, why, this, happened,, though, I, suspect, it, may, have, something, to, do, with, how, much, population, this, city, has, lost, since, the, mid-90s,, as, well, as, shifting, demographics, and, population, centers, within, the, city., I've, also, yet, to, hear, any, "Baltimore, Club", in, a, club,, mostly, it's, the, same, dance, pop, I'd, hear, anywhere, else,, but, maybe, I'm, just, not, going, to, the, right, places, or, nights., Posted, by, The, Jaded, Gay, DJ, at, 9:31, AM, No, comments:, Email, ThisBlogThis!Share, to, TwitterShare, to,
