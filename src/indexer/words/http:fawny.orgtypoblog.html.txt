[TypoBlog, Personal, typographic, Web, sites, are, giving, the, musty,, elitist, field, of, typography, is, a, stiff, kick, in, the, keister, [First, published, in, the, “LV:VI”, issue, of, Print,, 2002], I, grew, up, in, the, hick, province, of, New, Brunswick., (Eastern, Canada., Think, Mississippi,, but, with, coarse, French, accents.), While, the, other, kids, my, age, were, out, running, the, streets, and, sniffing, glue,, I, sat, at, home, memorizing, the, Letraset, catalogue, and, counting, the, days, until, the, next, baffling, issue, of, U&lc, arrived, in, the, mail., Worse, than, being, the, only, smart, kid, in, class, (as, I, usually, was), and, the, only, gay, kid, in, school, (as, I, apparently, was),, being, the, only, kid, who, knew, the, name, the, font, of, every, word, I, read, was, a, heavy, burden, to, bear., I, was, all, alone, in, my, typographic, obsession., Kids, growing, up, today, are, lucky., They’ve, got, the, Internet,, so, nobody, needs, to, feel, alone, anymore., Kids, can, be, smart, or, gay,, no, problem,, because, there, are, tons, of, smart, and/or, gay, kids, to, chat, with, online., Screen, names, provide, comforting, anonymity., Smart, and/or, gay, kids, have, their, own, damn, Web, sites., And, guess, what?, So, do, typographic, obsessifs., Personal, typographic, Web, sites, –, TypoBlogs, –, are, dragging, the, field, of, typography,, with, its, galactic, timescales, and, tradition, of, gentility,, into, the, rough-and-tumble, instantaneity, of, the, Web., If, your, experience, of, the, Web, dates, all, the, way, back, to, 1999, (“I, finally, gave, in, and, got, AOL”), or, consists, of, Microsoft, Hotmail,, Microsoft, Outlook, Express,, and, indeed, Microsoft, Windows,, this, “blog”, terminology, may, be, new, to, you., Weblogs, are, sites, run, by, individuals, or, small, groups, of, like-minded, people,, usually, of, two, types:, Links, to, other, sites, (usually, added, several, times, a, day, and, surrounded, by, short, pithy, commentary), on, the, one, hand, and, diaries, or, journals, on, the, other., The, speed, tribes, of, the, Web, deemed, the, twin, syllables, of, Weblog, too, onerous,, truncating, it, to, blog, (also, a, verb)., If, all, you, read, is, the, corporate, Web,, you’d, never, know, that, literally, tens, of, thousands, of, blogs, are, online., (I, run, four, five, myself.), And, a, small, coterie, of, TypoBlogs, give, you, fodder, for, your, typographic, obsessions, seven, days, a, week., There’s, quite, a, range, of, styles:, Strict, links, and, commentary;, personal, diatribe–slash–crusading, for, improved, populist, typography;, sell, fonts, and, publish, essays., The, whole, point, of, Weblogs, is, personal, expression., If, that, conjures, sick-making, images, of, interpretive, dancing, and, leopard-print, leg, warmers,, then, let’s, restate, the, claim:, The, whole, point, of, blogs, is, personality,, something, that, has, always, been, effaced, by, the, dignified, print, medium., (Beatrice, Warde,, crystal, goblet,, etc.), TypoBlogs, boast, a, sort, of, Sigmund, Freud,, a, source, to, which, all, successors, must, pay, homage,, in, the, form, of, Lines, &, Splines,, run, by, –, well,, let’s, just, do, a, copy, and, paste, from, its, About, page:, “My, name, is, Andy, Crewdson, and, I’m, a, 21-year-old, student, at, UC, Berkeley., The, phrase, ‘Lines, &, Splines’, refers, to, a, way, letters, can, be, constructed, on, the, computer;, digital, fonts, are, often, comprised, of, equations, which, describe, how, points,, lines, and, curves, (splines), combine, to, create, a, glyph.”, Futurologists, who, track, the, speed, of, uptake, of, new, technologies, (microwave, oven,, answering, machine,, fax,, computer,, Internet), could, write, an, entire, thesis, on, Lines, &, Splines,, which, became, instantly, and, universally, known, among, online, type, fans, upon, its, inauguration, on, October, 2,, 2000, (at, LinesandSplines.com)., Crewdson, writes, a, “classic”, links-and-commentary, blog, with, a, simple,, even, rudimentary, single, dual-column, design., (No, wild,, animated, “Flashturbation”, here.), But, his, typographic, scholarship, borders, on, the, terrifying,, with, the, sort, of, encyclopedic, knowledge, of, hot-metal, type, you, can, only, get, from, spending, weeks, in, musty, library, stacks,, to, say, nothing, of, mid-century, photosetting, fonts, and, everything, that’s, going, on, in, digital, type., When, I, was, 21,, I, could, barely, tie, my, shoelaces., The, net, is, a, platform, of, irony, and, contradiction., It, permits, a, combined, openness, and, secrecy., Through, its, mixture, of, written, medium, and, conversational, tone,, it, encourages, passive-aggression., Crewdson, is, an, exemplar:, He, runs, a, public, Weblog, but, refuses, to, be, interviewed., Interviewed, any, more,, that, is;, I, managed, to, conduct, an, E-mail, interview, for, one, of, my, Weblogs, in, 2000., But, an, extended, E-mail, exchange, with, Crewdson, for, this, article, followed, predictable, Internet, patterns,, quickly, deteriorating, into, a, shouting, match, after, he, renegged, on, initially, agreeing, to, be, interviewed., And, again, in, predictable, Internet, fashion,, neither, of, us, innocent, here,, including, me:, I, kvetched, and, whined, and, told, him, he’d, lost, a, faithful, fan,, to, which, Crewdson, pulled, a, Groucho, Marx, and, responded, “I, wouldn’t, want, any, ‘fan’, who, would, base, an, article, around, me.”, So, let’s, branch, further, out, on, the, tree., What, do, you, think, of, Lines, &, Splines,, Dean, Allen?, “Andy, pisses, me, off., Some, opinions, of, his, are, so, sure, and, informed,, nothing, at, all, like, I, would, have, carried, off, at, 21,”, says, the, Vancouver, Pompignan, book, designer/editor., Allen’s, own, TypoBlog,, Textism.com,, overflows, with, the, best, kind, of, sarcasm, (the, hilarious, kind),, plus, a, range, of, tutorials, and, utilities., Flash, movies, cover, “The, Evolution, of, Writing”, and, the, only, 20, book, typefaces, Allen, considers, worth, talking, about, (no, Flashturbation, here),, while, free, utilities, clean, the, crud, out, of, Microsoft, Word’s, exported, HTML, and, automate, writing, HTML, in, a, plain-text, editor., Allen, and, I, conversed, via, instant, messaging., (It’s, not, just, for, bobbysoxers, anymore.), “I, champion, universal, access, to, publishing,”, Allen, says,, “and,, as, much, as, I, frown, and, fret, over, ‘perfect’, type, design,, I, don’t, think, that, thinking, about, type, and, text, deserves, the, shoddy, treatment, given, it, by, highfalutin’, typesnobs., Knowledge, of, type, is, wrapped, up, in, this, Masonic, guild, mentality;, those, who, have, it, guard, it, closely., ‘I, worked, hard, to, gather, this, knowledge,, this, taste,, and, you, don’t, deserve, access, to, it.’, Listen, to, the, lisping, twats, of, Typo-L,, fer, chrissakes,”, he, adds,, referring, to, the, leading, online, mailing, list, on, typography., “Most, of, the, instructors, in, graphic, design, programs, were, themselves, educated, in, a, time, wherein, type, was, something, produced, from, their, pencil, sketch, by, a, professional.”, Back, on, the, topic, of, Crewdson:, “Actually,, scratch, that, last, bit,”, Allen, writes., “He’s, bright,, eager,, interested, in, the, right, things...., I, like, that, he’s, not, all, nancy-boy, about, the, site;, he’s, happy, to, leave, things, unpretty.”, It’s, not, as, though, he, –, or, anyone, else, –, has, much, choice., The, Web’s, coarse, screen, resolution, and, the, unpredictable, installed, typefaces, of, a, typical, Web-surfer’s, computer, are, brought, to, bear, to, expound, upon, high-resolution, typefaces., (The, Web, is, a, platform, of, irony,, remember.), It’s, a, trend, that, is, displacing, the, age-old, class, structure, of, typography., When, the, only, medium, in, which, to, discuss, print, was, print, itself,, discourse, was, expensive., You, had, better, have, a, good, reason, to, write,, design,, typeset,, print,, and, ship, your, typographic, treatise,, because, it’s, sure, gonna, cost, you., Magazines, on, typography, per, se,, as, opposed, to, those, with, a, catholic, focus, on, “graphics,”, “all, eventually, die, or, fade, out, because, you, can’t, go, on, knocking, your, head, against, the, wall, forever,” says, David, Michaelides,, co-owner, of, the, Canadian, FontShop, franchise, in, Toronto, (interviewed, by, voice, telephone, –, he’s, oldschool)., “There, is, no, money, to, be, made., Quite, the, opposite, –eventually, you, run, out, of, money., [Lines, &, Splines, is], in, some, ways, a, replacement, for, a, combination, of, Fine, Print, and, U&lc, on, a, much, smaller, and, much, more, personal, level, than, either, of, those..., but, the, only, thing, it’s, costing, the, fellow, is, energy, and, time,, which, he, may, well, run, out, of.", Looking, back, at, the, typophilia, of, my, youth,, there, was, a, marked, emphasis, on, coverage, of, two, genres:, Very, prestigious, Important, Books, (turgid,, seldom-read, volumes, that, win, type-design, accolades, from, the, usual, suspects, but, gather, dust, on, shelves), and, Manhattan, advertising, awards., Type, specimens, were, a, sort, of, hermetic,, onanistic, subgenre, useful, only, unto, themselves;, type, houses, seemed, reluctant, to, use, actual, words,, actual, prose,, actual, text, to, epitomize, their, typefaces., (How, many, times, did, I, read, the, meaningless, phrase, “26, good, reasons, to, use, ITC, [typeface, name]”, in, the, International, Typeface, Corp., specimen, books, I, spent, so, much, money, mail-ordering?), It, seemed, important, to, defend, typography, as, an, Important, Artistic, Form, against, the, dark, wolves, of, base, utilitarianism, baying, at, its, doorstep., After, all,, the, same, technologies, that, typeset, James, Joyce, and, Stanley, Morison, worked, just, as, well, to, typeset, supermarket, flyers,, shop, manuals,, and, pornography,, which, the, elites, conveniently, segregated, into, the, gulag, of, “vernacular”, typography., It, was, pros, vs., the, amateurs,, in, other, words, –, or,, seen, less, charitably,, the, quarterbacks, and, cheerleaders, vs., the, geeks, and, nerds., But, now,, the, same, Web, that’s, home, to, eBay, and,, indeed,, oceans, of, pornography, also, hosts, TypoBlogs., Allen, disputes, this, history,, which, he, sees, as, true, “only, for, a, brief, period, of, the, last, century., Previous, to, that,, the, typographer, was, often, also, printer,, bookseller,, editor,, publisher,”, very, much, tied, into, actual, words., And, Michaelides, asserts, that, “in, point, of, fact,, there, were, huge, amounts, of, ephemeral, material,, whether, things, like, the, Monotype, Recorder,, which, sort, of, split, the, difference, between, writing, about, fine, typography,, about, fine-press, work, and, that, sort, of, thing,, and, writing, about, commercial, and, practical, issues, of, typesetting;, and, trade, publications, and, catalogues, from, purely, commercial, lettering, houses, like, Andreesen, or, SWolor, or, Photo-Lettering, New, York., One, certainly, couldn’t, look, at, Photo-Lettering’s, catalogues, and, accuse, them, of, being, elitist, or, snobbish, or, oriented, towards, the, artisitic, use, of, typography., The, same, would, be, true, of, Lettering, Services, or, most, of, the, catalogues, of, those, companies, that, did, the, bulk, of, at, least, advertising, and, display, and, packaging, typography, for, decades.”, He, continues, (and, remember,, this, is, all, by, voice, –, Michaelides, is, oldschool, and, prolix):, “There, were, huge, amounts, of, literature, produced, about, commerical, lettering,, about, optical, lettering, systems,, whether, it, was, Typositor, or, Starmat, systems, or, hand-assembly, or, whatever, it, was,, not, to, mention, Letraset,, that, just, gets, ignored, as, though, it’s, not, part, of, the, books, about, books, or, the, typographic, literature.”, All, right,, then., My, history, isn’t, the, only, one., I, can, live, with, a, little, poststructuralism., Now,, though,, the, TypoBloggers, are, writing, a, history, of, their, own, –, a, history, of, the, entirety, of, typography, up, to, and, including, the, very, present, day,, written, in, the, present, day, and, read, that, same, present, day., But, type, sites, are, analyzing, typography, using, a, medium, so, inimical, to, the, subject, that, special, screenfonts, had, to, be, custom-engineered, to, assure, simple, legibility., Georgia, and, Verdana, are, the, quarterback, and, cheerleader, here,, designed, by, Matthew, Carter,, hinted, by, Tom, Rickner,, and, distributed, free, of, charge, by, Microsoft,, which, commissioned, them., Actually,, even, those, fonts, are, insufficient;, the, Web, tosses, more, obstacles, to, simple, legibility, in, the, designer’s, path., Dean, Allen:, “The, majority, of, effort, I, put, into, ‘design’, of, my, sites, isn’t, about, design, as, dressing,, it’s, about, overcoming, the, impediments, to, reading, that, are, found, in, plain, [text], delivery..., bad, hinting,, solid, leading,, potentially, marathon, line, lengths,, terrible, jittery, colour,, bad, linebreaks,, unclear, structural, hierarchy.”, “In, the, end,, on, screen, all, typefaces, at, certain, size, [and], resolution, look, similar,”, counters, Jean-François, Porchez., Unlike, Allen,, Crewdson,, and, Michaelides,, Porchez, is, an, actual, type, designer, (Angie,, Apolline,, Parisine,, and, a, range, of, custom, fonts, for, Le, Monde,, among, others)., Porchez’s, site,, PorchezTypo.com, (also, Typofonderie.com,, which, resolves, to, the, same, address),, barely, fits, the, traditional, Weblog, mould,, given, that, it, carries, only, a, few, journalistic, articles, in, its, Gazette, section., (Heck,, one, of, them, carries, the, title, “Where, are, the, Typonews, Web, Sites?”, It’s, not, as, though, you, have, to, look, very, hard, for, them.), At, first, blush,, the, site, seems, to, be, all, about, Porchez, faces,, and, as, such,, it, serves, as, the, face, of, Porchez., The, man, is, prodigious,, able, to, sketch, the, basic, outlines, of, a, new, typeface, in, a, single, afternoon., He’s, a, bit, shy, about, his, English, (which, is, more, than, serviceable),, but, in, person, he, is, nonetheless, able, to, advance, very, learned, but, instantly, understandable, points, about, traditional, book, and, newspaper, typography, –, exactly, the, sort, of, thing, that, blocky, Web, sites, militate, against., Given, these, lemons,, Porchez, chooses, to, make, lemonade,, offering, large-format, type, specimens,, well-chosen, text, typography, (in, Georgia, and, Verdana,, natch),, and, a, creamy, earth-tone, palette., Porchez, also, avails, himself, of, the, standard, cheat, of, online, display, typography, – working, up, a, display, block, in, Photoshop, and, uploading, it, as, a, GIF., The, result, is, a, site, that, feels, learned, but, not, twee, and, constipated,, technically, up-to-date, but, focused, on, the, Venetian,, Garalde,, and, Art, Deco, styles, of, antiquity., Porchez’s, site, started, in, 1997, “with, some, printed, material, I, had, in, hand,, such, the, new, Le, Monde, [typeface], specimen, just, produced, then., If, you’re, interested, in, some, good, articles, on, type,, then, you’ll, you, come, back, to, the, Web, site, and, finally, buy, a, font, one, day., But, that’s, not, the, main, reason., I, just, like, to, share, views, on, typography., “Also, I’m, influenced, by, French, people, such, Gérard, Blanchard., Until, his, death, in, 1998,, I, enjoyed, discussing, and, exchanging, views, on, typography, with, him., It’s, the, Rencontres, de, Lure, phenomenon,”, Porchez, says,, referring, to, type, meetings, held, monthly, in, Paris, and, little-known, outside, France., Indeed,, TypoBlogs, make, it, possible, to, carry, on, actual, conversations, about, typography., (Again,, no, more, sitting, in, your, lonely, room, moonily, fingering, Letraset, flashcards.), Except, that, irony, and, contradiction, raise, their, heads, again., Unlike, the, Rencontres, face-to-face, meetings,, or, instant, messaging,, or, a, mailing, list, like, Typo-L,, TypoBloggers, are, talking, at, each, other, rather, than, with., “Is, LettError.com, a, conversation, about, typography?”, asks, Erik, van, Blokland,, half, of, the, kooky, Dutch, type–programming–design, duo, LettError., “LettError.com, is, a, monologue,”, his, partner,, Just, van, Rossum,, instant-messages, in, response., (I, had, to, twist, van, Rossum’s, arm, to, sully, himself, by, using, the, instant-messaging, medium., For, him,, it’s, E-mail, or, bust.), There, was, even, some, dispute, as, to, whether, LettError.com, is, more, of, a, business., I, sat, there, and, let, “Just-n-Erik”, argue, back, and, forth, about, how, little, lucre, the, site, brings, in,, if, it, serves, as, a, kind, of, credibility, device, for, clients, already, interested, in, them,, or, acts, as, a, playground., “We’re, just, complaining, about, our, own, inability, to, set, up, something, profitable,”, van, Rossum, wrote, in, apology,, suddenly, remembering, my, continued, presence., But, truly,, you, can’t, ask, for, more, personality, than, Just-n-Erik’s,, the, merry, pranksters, who, view, type, as, programming., (The, Beowolf, typeface, never, prints, the, same, way, twice,, and, Just-n-Erik, invented, entire, subroutines, to, create, the, internal, cross-hatching, of, the, Federal, family.), To, paraphrase, Wilde,, LettError.com, leaves, the, impression, that, typography, is, too, important, to, be, taken, seriously., This, could, be, the, triumph, of, the, TypoBlog,, the, personal, typographic, Web, site:, Taking, typography, down, a, notch., There, won’t, be, any, more, aficionados,, only, fans,, just, as, nitro-burning, monster, trucks, have, fans, rather, than, aficionados., “The, book, arts, in, general, have, always, attracted, the, individuals, with, the, collector, mentality,”, says, David, Michaelides., “A, certain, portion, of, the, subculture, of, typography, is, composed, of, individuals, with, compulsive, collecting, manias...., Even, serious, practical, typographers,, career, typographers, who, are, not, in, it, purely, for, interest’s, sake,, can, virtually, never, resist, the, temptation, to, identify, a, typeface., “It’s, the, nature, of, typography, that, it, is, an, encyclopedic, field., It’s, a, kind, of, taxonomy, very, similar, to, biological, taxonomy, –, perfect, for, 18th-century, scholars, in, the, naturalistic, scheeme,, and, perfect, for, the, obsessive, crank.”, “Those, with, an, interest, in, type, are, furious, researchers,, jealous, of, other’s, knowledge,”, says, Dean, Allen., “The, Web, is, the, ideal, arena, for, the, exchange, of, maniacally, detailed, opinion., What, used, to, be, solitary,, quiet, work, now, happens, in, cubicle, mosh, pits.”, And, the, kicker?, Andy, Crewdson, is, now, running, his, own, interviews, on, Lines, &, Splines., Updated, 2002.05.03, You, were, here:,
