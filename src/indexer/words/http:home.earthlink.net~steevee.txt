An, editor, of, CAHIERS, DU, CINEMA, from, 1974, to, 1981,, critic, for, the, daily, LIBERATION, from, 1981, until, his, death,, and, founder, of, TRAFIC,, Daney, published, four, books, during, his,

will., If, anyone, out, there, would, like, a, copy,, please, contact, me., In, other, Daney, news,, the, French, publisher, POL, has, just, released, a, collection, of, his, work, from, 1964, through, 1981,, the, period, when, he, wrote, for, CAHIERS, DU, CINEMA., The, best, source, for, ordering, Daney's, French, books, in, North, America, appears, to, be , Gallimard,, Montreal's, French-language, bookstore., They, carry, TRAFIC,, as, well., Early, in, 2007,, Berg, Publishers, will, be, releasing, POSTCARDS, FROM, THE, CINEMA,, an, English-language, translation, of,

interview, with, former, CAHEIRS, DU, CINEMA, editor, Serge, Toubiana., My, review, has, appeared, in, CINEASTE's, fall, 2007, issue., I'm, not, sure, if, it, will, become, available, on-line, -, as,
