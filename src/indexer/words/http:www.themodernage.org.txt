journals”, morphing, into, an, entire, blog, culture., This, blog, has, served, as, the, gateway, to, introducing, me, to, amazingly, interesting,, kind,, and, wonderful, friends;, allowed, me, to, witness, mind-blowing, concerts, that, I, will, never, forget;, and, acted, as, the, creative, outlet, for, all, my, crazy, thoughts,, emotions,, and, ideas, surrounding, what, it, is, to, be, a, music, fan., I’ve, published, a, total, of, 5,481, posts, on, this, blog,, but, it’s, been, over, a, year, since, I, wrote, something, new., By, now, you’ve, probably, guessed, I’ve, actually, gotten, old,, gotten, slow,, and, gotten, annoyed, over, having, to, elbow, people, who, were, born, in, the, 90s, (I, effing, remember, the, 90s), just, to, get, a, good, sight, line, at, a, crowded, concert, —, and, you, would, be, right., Now, here, are, some, things, you, probably, didn’t, see, coming:, I, got, married, I, moved, out, of, New, York, City, I, started, a, new, blog, where, I,

ruminations, Lera, Lynn:, More, than, Just, the, Sad, Bar, Singer, on, “True, Detective”, As, I’ve, been, watching, HBO’s, “True, Detective”, Season, 2,, there, have, been, so, many, questions:, “Can, female, detectives, really, wear, skinny, jeans, and, cool, shirts, on, the, job?”, (according, to, a, real, cop, –, turns, out, this, is, true,, as, long, as, it, doesn’t, restrict, your, motion),, “Did, Vince, Vaughn, known, when, he, was, filming, ‘The, Internship’, that, he, would, once, again, get, a, chance, at, a, serious, acting, job?’, (No,, maybe?),, and, probably, most, important,, “WHO, IS, that, sad-eyed, lady, singing, those, heartbreakingly, depressing, songs, in, the, bar, that, Frank, and, Ray, (and, sometimes, Ani), frequent?”, If, you, Google, “singer, true, detective, bar”,, the, internet, responds, by, letting, you, know, the, lady, is, American, singer-songwriter, Lera, Lynn., But, why, stop, there?, Here, are, 10, cool, things, to, know, about, her:, 1., She, was, born, in, Texas,, raised, in, Georgia, and, Louisiana,, and, now, lives, in, Nashville., According, to, Wikipedia,, Lynn, has, had, a, life-long, helping, of, good, Southern, living, —, giving, her, the, perfect, material, (and, musical, influence), for, coming, up, with, ideas, for, those, sad, sad, songs, that, evoke, the, darkest, bits, of, the, American, experience., Photo, by, Ixchel, Lara, 2., Her, manager, hooked, her, up, with, ‘True, Detective’, musical, supervisor, T, Bone, Burnett,, and, the, rest, is, kinda, history., Lynn’s, manager,, Sheri, Sands,, knew, Burnett, from, working, together, on, the, Robert, Plant, +, Alison, Krauss, album, Raising, Sand., Sands, asked, Burnett, if, he, would, be, interested, in, using, a, song, off, of, Lynn’s, new, EP,, Lying, in, the, Sun,, for, “True, Detective”, and, after, taking, a, listen,, he, asked, for, a, meeting, with, Lynn, in, Nashville., Once, he, had, Lynn, there, in, person,, Burnett, asked, if, she, would, like, to, write, some, original, songs, together, for, the, show., Lynn, jumped, at, the, chance., She, even, got, to, co-write, with, Rosanne, Cash, on, the, haunting, song, “My, Least, Favorite, Life”, from, the, show:, 3., “True, Detective”, showrunner, Nic, Pizzolatto, gave, her, super-vauge, concepts, to, write, songs, about,, and, hardly, any, time, to, practice, them, once, written., Out, of, fear, of, leaking, any, plot, points, or, major, twists, about, the, show,, Nic, Pizzolatto, gave, very, little, information, about, the, story, arc, to, Lynn., He’d, basically, just, give, her, a, sense, of, the, mood/tone, he, wanted, —, maybe, a, basic, concept, like, “write, a, song, about, church, ruins”, that, that, was, basically, it., After, the, song, was, written,, Pizzolatto, would, rush, to, film, it, —, Lynn, told, Noisey,, “[Nic], wanted, very, languid, performances, and, it, was, difficult, to, do, that, because, we’d, just, write, the, song, and, then, immediately, set, up, the, mics, and, I’d, record, it.”, 4., She, doesn’t, want, to, be, tied, to, the, Man., She, self-releases, all, of, her, own, music,, thankyouverymuch., For, Lynn,, artistic, control, is, most, important,, and, that’s, why, she, self-produces, and, releases, with, the, help, of, artist-friendly, outfits, like, Slow, Records., She, told, the, Chicago, Reader, that’s, she’s, had, offers, from, labels,, “but, the, most, important, thing, …, is, being, able, to, make, the, music, that, I, want, to, make,, and, to, be, able, to, perform, it, the, way, I, want, to, perform, it., That’s, not, always, in, line, with, the, business, side, of, things.”, 5., She, credits, her, mom, with, introducing, music, into, her, life, in, a, significant, way., Lynn’s, mom, was, a, singer, in, a, rock, music, cover, band,, and, that’s, how, she, first, got, introduced, to, music., Mom, also, would, play, all, sorts, of, artists,, from, Vince, Gill, to, Joni, Mitchell, to, Michael, Jackson, around, the, house,, giving, Lynn, wide, exposure, to, all, sorts, of, musical, genres., Continue, reading, “Lera, Lynn:, More, than, Just, the, Sad, Bar, Singer, on, “True, Detective””, Author,
