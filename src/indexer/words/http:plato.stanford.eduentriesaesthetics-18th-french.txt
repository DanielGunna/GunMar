revision, Wed, Apr, 24,, 2013, A, new, kind, of, discourse, on, art,, beauty,, and, human, sensibilities, emerged, in, the, 18th, Century,, for, which, Baumgarten,, in, Germany,, coined, the, term, ‘aesthetics’., The, discourse, was, influenced, by, the, general, philosophical, problems, discussed, during, the, Enlightenment,, with, its, ideals, of, liberty,, democracy,, and, scientific, inquiry., The, present, entry, examines, the, French, contribution, to, this, new, field., Britain,, and, especially, Scotland,, led, the, way,, not, only, in, the, work, of, its, empiricists, such, as, Hutcheson, and, Hume, but, also, in, the, work, of, Reid,, who, resisted, the, empiricist, tradition., These, philosophers, raised, issues, and, put, forward, ideas, that, influenced, thinkers, in, Europe, with, an, interest, in, art, and, our, relationship, to, nature., A, discussion, of, the, British, contribution, to, aesthetics, in, the, 18th, century, can, be, found, in, the, entry, 18th, Century, British, Aesthetics., By, contrast,, Germany's, achievement, is, to, be, found, in, an, enduring, program, to, systematize, a, new, domain, of, knowledge,, and, this, can, be, found, in, work, starting, with, Baumgarten, and, culminating, in, Kant., A, discussion, of, the, German, contribution, to, aesthetics, in, the, 18th, century, can, be, found, in, the, entry, 18th, Century, German, Aesthetics., The, French, contribution, to, aesthetics, in, the, 18th, century, was, primarily, the, result, of, two, factors:, (1), the, extensive, use, of, French, as, a, lingua, franca, among, learned, people, after, the, decline, of, Latin, and, prior, to, the, growing, dominance, of, English,, and, (2), the, existence, of, an, intellectual, culture, of, writing, and, theorizing., The, term, ‘philosopher’, in, 18th-century, France, was, not, applied, only, to, people, such, as, Descartes, and, Locke,, but, also, to, a, new, group, of, writers, able, to, combine, intellectual, analysis,, literature, and, social, commentary., Voltaire, and, Diderot, were, two, distinguished, such, figures;, both, had, a, passion, for, writing, theatrical, plays, and, stories, and, both, wished, to, understand, and, advance, society., Neither, wrote, a, treatise, on, aesthetics,, but, they, contributed, to, its, development, more, than, the, other, French, writers, of, this, period, by, systematically, working, through, the, different, areas, and, levels, of, human, thought., In, their, writings,, and, those, of, others,, Reason, was, no, longer, seen, as, a, faculty, whose, sole, purpose, was, to, identify, the, truth,, but, increasingly, as, a, faculty, of, testing, and, evaluating, judgments,, including, the, judgments, of, sentiment,, taste, and, individuality., For, the, first, time,, perhaps,, art, became, as, significant, for, humanity, as, scientific, thought,, or, rather,, the, complete, dissociation, between, the, pursuits, of, art, and, science, started, to, break, down., 1., Prologue:, A, Turbulent, Beginning, 2., Sentiment, and, Taste, 3., Persistence, of, a, Rationalist, Brand, 4., From, Connoisseurs, to, Art, Critics, 5., Art, as, Philosophy, 6.,

the, impression, that, there, is, a, uniformity, and, coherence, to, it,, often, associated, with, the, artistic, sensibilities, of, King, Louis, XIV, and, the, cultural, authority, of, Cardinal, Richelieu's, Académie, Française., Upon, closer, examination,, however,, the, art, of, the, period, reveals, evidence, of, tension, and, even, conflicts., These, are, the, seeds, of, major, changes, to, come., Some, of, these, tensions, and, conflicts, arose, over, controversial, plays., For, example,, Corneille's, first, hit,, The, Cid, (1636),, set, up, one, of, the, strongest, schemas, of, classical, theater,, i.e.,, the, contest, of, love, and, duty., The, play, was, attacked, from, various, quarters,, and, accused, not, only, of, failing, to, offer, moral, instruction,, but, of, failing, to, adhere, to, accepted, dramatic, practices, concerning, setting, and, plot., Later, on,, in, his, Three, Discourses, on, Dramatic, Poetry, (1660),, Corneille, suggested, that, authors, should, be, allowed, to, depart, from, Aristotle's, aesthetic, principles,, though, of, course, he, does, not, suggest, that, those, principles, be, totally, abandoned., Another, conflict,, involving, censorship, and, sensitive, subjects,, arose, in, connection, with, Moliere's, Tartuffe, (1664, and, 1669),, which, was, in, some, quarters, received, as, a, satire, of, religion,, though, it, is, in, reality, an, attack, on, religious, hypocrisy., It, is, worth, noticing, that, though, the, Company, of, the, Blessed, Sacrament, (a, secret, Catholic, society), succeeded, in, imposing, a, ban, on, public, performances,, the, personal, support, of, the, King, allowed, Moliere, to, prevail, in, the, end., In, some, of, the, conflicts, that, seem, outwardly, to, have, been, mere, skirmishes, among, rivals, there, is, often, substantially, more, at, stake., A, typical, case, is, Lully's, Alceste, (January, 1674)., The, first, production, of, this, opera, served, as, the, pretext, not, only, for, conspiracy, theories, by, musicians, faithful, to, Charpentier, and, hostile, to, Lully's, ascendancy, in, French, music, (Lully, was, of, Italian, origin, and, had, been, running, the, Royal, Academy, of, Music, since, 1672),, but, also, for, sarcastic, writings, from, Boileau,, who, despised, Quinault,, the, author, of, the, libretto., However,, the, situation, got, more, complicated, in, August, 1674,, when, Racine's, Iphigénie, was, first, performed., Racine's, play, appeared, to, have, nothing, in, common, with, Euripides's, original,, except, that, Euripides, inspired, both., The, polemical, issue, was, not, so, much, about, the, value, of, the, two, works, as, about, whether,, and, to, what, extent,, the, classical, models, for, drama, developed, by, the, Ancients, must, be, imitated., All, of, these, professional, rivalries, came, within, a, single, larger, controversy, that, structured, an, important, part, of, the, intellectual, life, of, that, period,, known, as, the, Quarrel, of, Ancients, and, Moderns, (“the, Quarrel”)., The, Quarrel, reflected, polarized, attitudes, toward, art, and, society,, which, lasted, well, into, the, next, century., The, Quarrel, is, usually, divided, into, three, distinct, phases., The, first, had, its, roots, in, Italy, when, writers, like, Boccalini,, Tassoni,, and, Lancelotti, undertook, to, minimize, the, achievements, of, contemporary, writers, as, compared, to, those, of, Antiquity., This, phase, includes, the, methods, that, Galileo, developed,, resulting, in, a, physics, that, challenged, Aristotle's., But, this, phase, of, the, Quarrel, reached, its, climax, in, France,, where, it, was, contested, throughout, a, wider, range, of, intellectuals., In, the, 17th, century,, Descartes, challenged, scholastic, throught,, which, was, rigidly, Aristotelian., And, Pascal, criticized, those, of, his, contemporaries, who, remained, slavish, to, the, authority, of, the, Ancients;, he, thought, that, the, work, of, the, Ancients, was, a, fixed, body, of, knowledge, that, was, difficult, to, extend,, and, suggested, that, knowledge, is, instead, a, cumulative, process, making, it, easier, to, move, forward, as, time, goes, on, and, foundations, are, made, more, secure., Another, important, cause, of, tension, was, the, persistent, use, of, mythological, themes, in, art, and, literature, in, a, society, still, devoted, to, Christianity., Desmarets, de, St-Sorlin, did, his, best,, in, his, work,, to, show, that, Christian, themes, and, imagery, were, of, a, worth, equal, to, their, pagan, counterparts., While, the, subjects, of, his, plays, were, generally, taken, from, history, (e.g.,, Scipion,, Erigone),, his, poems, (e.g.,, Marie-Magdalene,, Abraham), were, inspired, by, the, Bible, and, were,, at, the, same, time,, concealed, acts, of, allegiance, to, an, absolutist, concept, of, political, power., It, is, precisely, that, aspect, which, becomes, prominent, in, the, second, phase, of, the, Quarrel,, when, Perrault, read, his, poem, The, Century, of, Louis, the, Great, at, the, Academy,, on, January, 27th,, 1687., The, poem, combined, an, eloquent, plea, in, favor, of, Moderns, (later, developed, into, the, four-volume, work,, Parallel, of, the, Ancients, and, Moderns,, published, from1688, to, 1697), with, a, labored, praise, of, the, King., At, this, point,, aesthetics, and, politics, become, entangled, because, some, of, the, disagreements, in, the, Quarrel, became, less, concerned, about, the, value, of, works, of, art, than, about, the, choice, of, an, effective, policy, in, the, arts., Though, he, is, the, champion, of, the, Ancient, party,, Boileau, is, unexpectedly, also, the, most, lucid, on, the, disadvantages, of, the, courtier, attitude., Fumaroli, (2001), suggests, that, Boileau's, main, criticism, against, the, Modern, contingent, is, that, they, care, more, about, flattering, the, King, rather, than, creating, a, genuinely, new, tradition., Therefore, he, defends, the, “great, style”, as, a, simple, style,, devoid, of, any, sign, of, flattery., Fontenelle,, the, main, spokesman, of, the, Moderns,, is, not, far, from, his, rival's, view,, but, he, formulates, this, requirement, differently:, poetic, license, should, be, free, from, the, constraints, of, conforming, with, traditions,, and, this, should, take, precedence, over, the, pursuit, of, masterpieces., If, art, is, to, improve, the, intellect, and, morality,, one, should, not, subject, art, works, to, a, priori, principles., The, third, phase, of, the, Quarrel,, which, took, place, simultaneously, in, France, and, England,, is, known, as, the, “Homer, Quarrel”,, for, it, originates, in, several, translations, of, Homer's, Iliad,, especially, those, by, Anne, Dacier, (1699, and, 1711), and, Alexander, Pope, (1715-1724)., The, peak, of, the, dispute, was, reached, in, France, when, Houdar, de, la, Motte, published, a, short, version, of, Homer's, poem,, free, of, what, he, thought, were, anachronistic, digressions, (1714)., Dacier, counter-attacks, straight, off, with, her, Of, Causes, of, Corruption, of, Taste., Combativeness, between, defendants, and, opponents, was, fueled, by, replies, that, trade, libels, across, the, Channel., On, the, English, side,, Wotton,, Dryden,, and, Swift, (The, Battle, of, the, Books,, 1704), are, the, most, pugnacious;, in, France,, Saint-Hyacinthe,, Boivin,, Fathers, Buffier, and, Terrasson, are, no, less, convinced, until, Fénelon, diplomatically, proposes, a, reconciliation., It, might, seem, today, that, these, are, the, last, echoes, of, a, rear-guard, action,, restricted, to, rhetoric, and, literature,, without, any, significant, counterpart, in, the, realm, of, the, pictorial, arts., In, fact,, it, happens, that, there, was, conflict, there, too,, namely, between, the, so-called, Poussinists, and, Rubenists,, though, the, repercussions, were, quite, different., The, historical, background, of, this, “Coloring, quarrel”, lies, in, the, growing, glory, of, Titian, and, Rubens,, dampened, at, first, by, the, fortunes, of, Raphael, and, Michelangelo., The, debate, hinged, on, the, status, of, color., For, a, long, time,, color, had, been, disregarded,, for, at, least, three, reasons:, it, is,, in, Le, Brun's, words,, “but, an, accident, produced, by, the, reflection, of, light, and, that, varies, according, to, circumstances”, (AT,, 183);, it, appeals, to, sensuality, whereas, “we, must, not, judge, by, our, senses, alone, but, by, reason”, as, Poussin, puts, it, (AT,, 69);, and, it, proves, unable, to, serve, as, a, foundation, for, painting,, unlike, drawing,, which, is, related, to, the, mind, (cf., the, original, sense, of, disegno, =, drawing, or, design)., It, is, Leonardo's, dictum, in, his, Treatise, on, Painting, (c., 1490), that, “painting, is, dumb, poetry,, and, poetry, is, blind, painting”, which, opened, the, way, to, a, better, understanding., The, painter, Blanchard, cautiously, started, to, endorse, the, use, of, color, in, the, Academy, in, 1671., He, did, not, want, to, “diminish, the, importance, of, design”, but, to, “establish, three, things, in, defense, of, color:, first,, that, color, is, just, as, necessary, to, the, art, of, painting, as, design;, secondly,, that, if, we, diminish, the, worth, of, color,, we, thereby, also, diminish, the, worth, of, painters;, and, thirdly,, that, color, merited, the, praise, of, the, Ancients,, and, that, it, merits, it, again, in, our, own, age”, (AT,, 178-179)., Design, is, a, necessary, foundation,, certainly,, but, if, the, aim, of, the, painter, is, “both, to, deceive, the, eyes, and, to, imitate, nature”,, it, is, reasonable, to, conclude, that, color, serves, that, goal, best,, because, “herein, lies, the, difference, that, distinguishes, painting, from, all, the, other, arts, and, which, gives, painting, its, own, specific, end”, (AT,, 180)., This, was, clearly, an, attempt, to, turn, to, his, advantage, Poussin's, phrase, that, the, aim, of, painting, is, delectation, –, but, insufficient, indeed, to, convince, Le, Brun, and, Champaigne,, to, say, nothing, of, Testelin,, the, tyrannical, and, finicky, Secretary, and, author, of, the, rigid, Tables, of, Precepts., Two, men, were, going, to, play, a, special, role, in, the, color, crusade., It, may, seem, odd, to, mention, Félibien, first, because, he, is, generally, and, rightly, considered, as, a, representative, of, the, orthodox, view., But, he, was, also, liberal-minded,, respectful, of, differing, opinions, (it, was, to, cost, him, his, position!), and, anxious, to, find, a, fair, balance, between, the, gifts, of, the, mind, and, the, talents, of, the, hand., For, him,, “beauty, is, a, result, of, the, proportion, and, symmetry, between, corporeal, and, material, parts”, (AT,, 220),, so, that, color, cannot, be, discarded, since, “everything, should, appear, so, artfully, connected, that, the, whole, painting, seems, to, have, been, painted, at, one, and, the, same, time,, and,, as, it, were,, from, the, same, palette”, (AT,, 568)., When, he, translates, Du, Fresnoy's, De, Arte, Graphica, (1668), and, publishes, his, Dialogue, upon, Coloring, (1673),, Roger, de, Piles, may, appear, to, hold, stronger, views;, however,, by, transferring, emphasis, from, color, to, coloring,, he, too, stresses, the, importance, of, harmony, and, the, way, it, presupposes, mastery, of, local, color, and, chiaroscuro., When, de, Piles, entered, the, Academy, three, decades, later,, he, would, produce, a, synthesis, under, the, title, Principles, of, Painting, (1708),, in, which, he, insists, that, “true, painting, is, such, as, not, only, surprises,, but, as, it, were,, calls, to, us;, and, has, so, powerful, an, effect,, that, we, cannot, help, coming, near, it,, as, if, it, had, something, to, tell, us”, (AT,, 309)., In, a, word,, “the, spectator, is, not, obliged, to, seek, for, truth, in, a, painting;, but, truth,, by, its, effect,, must, call, to, the, spectator,, and, force, his, attention”, (AT,, 310)., That, points, to, what, he, called, “the, whole, together”,, that, is, “a, general, subordination, of, objects, one, to, another,, as, makes, them, all, concur, to, constitute, but, one”,, for, the, utmost, satisfaction, of, the, eye, (AT,, 312)., The, same, lesson, can, be, drawn, from, Antoine, Coypel's, writings,, where, “the, excellence, of, painting”, is, no, longer, separate, from, “the, aesthetic, of, the, painter”., His, nomination, as, Academy's, Director, in, 1714, is, the, sign, that, a, page, has, been, turned., 2., Sentiment, and, Taste, It, is, difficult, to, find, an, abrupt, line, of, demarcation, between, the, artistic, styles, of, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries., There, are,, however,, lots, of, local, developments, that, are, of, some, significance., Dominique, Bouhours, is, a, major, figure, during, this, period, of, transition., He, was, a, professor, of, humanities, and, very, celebrated, in, the, Paris, salons., He, published, The, Conversations, of, Aristo, and, Eugene, in, 1671,, with, a, sequel, in, 1687., The, two, books, were, widely, read,, often, reissued, and, with, the, second, translated, into, English, as, The, Art, of, Criticism, (1705)., One, significant, feature, of, his, work, (though,, as, Félibien, and, de, Piles, show,, it, wasn't, considered, ordinary, at, the, time), is, the, adoption, of, the, dialogue, form., This, affords, two, main, benefits., First,, it, gives, the, author, an, opportunity, to, put, in, face-to-face, debate, a, representative, of, classicism, and, a, lover, of, delicacy, and, charm., These, characters, personify,, respectively,, Boileau, and, what, we, might, call, an, 18th, century, aesthete., Second,, it, encourages, the, author, to, work, out, certain, ideas, in, the, guise, of, inquiry., Indeed,, the, dialogical, presentation, proves, the, best, way, to, address, objections,, variations,, or, digressions, that, make, up, the, real, substance, of, investigation,, so, that, philosophical, profit, goes, hand, in, hand, with, the, pleasure, of, conversing., Bouhours, himself, gives, his, reader, total, freedom, of, judgment., One, well-known, concept, stressed, by, Bouhours, is, the, famous, “je, ne, sais, quoi”, [I, don't, know, what],, “that, indefinable, something, whose, effects, you, feel, ”, (AT,, 227)., Bouhours, is, attempting, to, put, his, finger, on, some, component, that, is, essential, to, a, work, of, art, but, which, defies, description., The, expression, seems, to, foil, any, analysis;, all, you, can, say,, as, Gracián, puts, it,, is, to, admit, that, “this, certain, something,, without, wanting, any, thing, itself,, enters, into, every, thing, to, give, it, worth, and, value”, (AT,, 207)., Bouhours, writes, that, “the, je, ne, sais, quoi, is, like, those, beauties, covered, with, a, veil,, which, are, the, more, highly, prized, for, being, less, exposed, to, view,, and, to, which, the, imagination, always, adds, something”, (AT,, 229)., Half, a, century, later,, Marivaux, concludes, that, it, is, the, attribute, par, excellence, of, Grace:, “in, these, paintings, that, you, like, so,, in, these, objects, of, every, kind, which, so, delight, you,, in, the, entire, expanse, of, the, grounds,, in, all, that, you, perceive,, here, simple,, here, untended,, irregular, even,, sometimes, ornate,, sometimes, not,, I, am, there, and, I, show, myself., I, bestow, my, charm, on, everything,, I, surround, you”, (AT,, 415)., Though, these, sentences, fail, to, give, the, sense, of, the, phrase,, it, is, clear, that, many, accept, some, indefinable, component, to, artworks., This, ineffable, something, seems, to, be, an, emotional, component, of, human, nature, just, as, reason, is, a, component, of, the, mind,, and, thus, deserves, to, be, investigated., The, author, who, was, to, carry, out, this, investigation, in, France, is, the, Abbé, Jean-Baptiste, du, Bos,, in, his, Critical, Reflections, on, Poetry, and, Painting, (1719)., Du, Bos, had, studied, theology,, was, a, diplomat, and, an, historian,, a, theater, and, opera, enthusiast,, and, above, all,, he, was, erudite, in, classical, theater, and, archeology,, with, a, special, interest, in, numismatics., He, was, also, a, rationalist,, though, hostile, to, Descartes,, and, he, had, traveled, in, the, Netherlands, and, England,, where, he, met, Locke., He, could, read, English, (which, was, uncommon, in, France, at, that, time), as, well, as, other, languages., It, is, certain, that, he, had, read, Addison,, and, maybe, Shaftesbury,, and, these, works, may, have, engendered, a, sensualist, trend, in, his, own, work, though, without, any, trace, of, sentimentalism., (Sensualism, here, is, the, view, that, sensations, and, perceptions, are, more, important, to, knowledge, than, abstract, ideas.), His, eclectic, interests, led, him, to, become, acquainted, with, Bayle, and, Leibniz,, though, he, was, also, open, to, experimental, philosophy., In, 1719,, he, became, a, member, of, the, Académie, Royale, des, Inscriptions, et, Belles-Lettres, and,, as, early, as, 1722,, was, elevated, to, the, capacity, of, Perpetual, Secretary., But, his, main, claim, to, fame, for, posterity, remains, by, far, his, Critical, Reflections,, of, which, Voltaire, wrote, in, 1738, that, it, was, “the, most, useful, book, ever, written, on, these, topics, in, every, country, of, Europe”., It, was, published, by, a, happy, coincidence, in, the, same, year, as, J., Richardson's, The, Science, of, a, Connoisseur,, which, deals, with, related, matters., Du, Bos, begins, by, considering, the, subjective, impression, triggered, by, the, contact, with, works, of, art., Anticipating, Burke,, he, argues, that, aesthetic, pleasure, is, a, pure, emotion,, the, physical, result, of, the, stirring, of, our, organs,, even, if, its, nature, is, indeed, paradoxical, (i.e.,, a, mixture, of, pleasure, and, anxiety)., While, Nicole, and, Bossuet, were, scorning, art, as, perniciously, diverting, people, from, the, real, duties, of, life, and, salvation,, du, Bos, insists, that, art, is, necessary, to, fight, against, worries, and, tedium., Such, a, struggle, makes, passions, attractive, in, spite, of, their, menaces., Art, is, a, method, of, rescue, for, it, makes, use, of, the, pathetic, while, neutralizing, its, unpleasant, effects:, “Since, the, most, pleasing, sensations, that, our, real, passions, can, afford, us,, are, balanced, by, so, many, unhappy, hours, that, succeed, our, enjoyments,, would, it, not, be, a, noble, attempt, of, art, to, endeavor, to, separate, the, dismal, consequences, of, our, passions, from, the, bewitching, pleasure, we, receive, in, indulging, them?, Is, it, not, in, the, power, of, art, to, create,, as, it, were,, beings, of, a, new, nature?, Might, not, art, contrive, to, produce, objects, that, would, excite, artificial, passions,, sufficient, to, occupy, us, while, we, are, actually, affected, by, them,, and, incapable, of, giving, us, afterwards, any, real, pain, or, affliction?”, (AT,, 395)., So, if, it, is, certain, that, the, massacre, of, the, innocents, would, be, an, unbearable, spectacle, to, see,, nevertheless, Le, Brun's, painting, on, this, very, same, subject, excites, both, our, compassion, and, admiration., Another, feature, of, du, Bos's, work,, and, one, that, anticipates, Diderot,, is, his, awareness, of, the, distinction, between, the, various, arts., Though, open-minded, and, a, sensualist, (as, defined, above),, he, does, not, call, the, framework, of, imitation, into, question,, but, rather, feels, attached, to, the, traditional, hierarchies, among, and, within, the, arts., In, the, sixth, chapter,, he, agrees, with, Quintilian's, precept, that, “imitation, operates, always, with, less, force, than, the, object, imitated”,, which, implies, that, genre, paintings, and, satire, poetry, for, instance, cannot, engage, our, attention, for, a, long, time., Even, the, most, magnificent, landscapes, are, powerless, without, figures;, if, it, were, devoid, of, the, shepherds, and, the, sepulchral, inscription,, Poussin's, Arcadia, would, be, no, exception., But, what, du, Bos, sees, clearly, is, the, failure, of, the, famous, “ut, pictura, poesis”, (“as, is, painting,, so, is, poetry”)., Although, he, is, himself, a, man, of, letters,, as, a, sensualist,, he, prefers, painting, because, of, its, sensible, medium., He, says,, “the, art, of, painting, is, so, extremely, delicate, and, attacks, us, by, means, of, a, sense,, which, has, so, great, an, empire, over, our, soul,, that, a, picture, may, be, rendered, agreeable, by, the, very, charms, of, the, execution,, independent, of, the, object, which, it, represents:, but, I, have, already, observed,, that, our, attention, and, esteem, are, fixt, then, upon, the, art, of, the, imitator,, who, knows, how, to, please,, even, without, moving, us., We, admire, the, pencil, that, has, been, so, capable, of, counterfeiting, nature”, (AT,, 399)., Similar, arguments, were, taken, up, repeatedly,, e.g., by, Diderot,, Adam, Smith,, and, Goncourt., As, for, du, Bos,, it, follows, that, poets, and, painters, have, to, select, subjects, that, are, appropriate, to, the, means, of, their, arts;, a, sublime, rejoinder, in, a, tragedy, could, only, be, tritely, rendered, on, a, canvas, and,, similarly,, a, vast, scene, full, of, animation, that, displays, the, mastery, of, the, painter, would, only, be, annoying, in, a, poem, that, attempted, something, similar., There, is, a, second, stage, of, du, Bos's, analysis,, namely,, an, account, of, the, conditions, that, sustain, the, value, of, art, as, a, human, phenomenon., This, second, stage, is, in, fact, a, bit, dated, because, it, rests, on, an, unscientific, theory, of, how, climate, affects, human, endeavors., Du, Bos, mistakenly, supposes, that, the, emanations, from, the, earth, and, the, variations, in, quality, of, the, air, are, responsible, for, the, differences, in, productivity, among, countries, and, centuries., Du, Bos, compares, genius,, “that, ability, received, from, nature, to, do, well, and, easily, certain, things, that, the, others, could, only, achieve, badly,, even, when, they, get, a, lot, of, trouble, to, do, so”, with, a, plant, which, “so, to, speak,, is, growing, by, itself”., He, does, not, subscribe,, however,, to, determinism., The, Critical, Reflections, were, read, and, quoted, extensively, throughout, the, rest, of, the, 18th, century, (and, still, more, often, used, without, citation)., An, extreme, case, is, the, entry, ‘Painting’, (written, by, Jaucourt), in, the, Encyclopédie,, which, consists, of, a, collage, of, almost, thirty, fragments, taken, from, du, Bos,, some, of, which, are, just, a, few, lines, while, the, longest, is, several, pages!, Likewise, Montesquieu, in, his, Essay, on, Taste, (ca, 1755), owes, du, Bos, more, than, is, avowed., It, is, probably, in, Switzerland, that, du, Bos's, influence, was, the, most, fertile:, Bodmer, borrows, from, him, to, fight, against, Gottsched's, academism,, and, Sulzer, takes, him, as, a, basis, for, his, theory, of, sensibility., Beyond, that,, his, legitimate, heirs, are, undoubtedly, Lessing, and, Mendelssohn,, the, last, free-thinkers, to, precede, the, systematic, program, implemented, by, Baumgarten, and, Kant., 3., Persistence, of, a, Rationalist, Brand, It, might, seem, as, though, the, development, of, aesthetic, theory, in, the, 18th, century, French, aesthetics, is, definitely, settled, by, du, Bos, and, that, there, is, nothing, more, to, be, said, on, the, importance, of, our, subjective, response, to, art, and, on, the, importance, of, sensations, and, perceptions, (as, opposed, to, abstract, ideas), to, our, knowledge., But, though, this, turn, to, subjectivism, and, sensualism, was, compelling,, rationalism, does, not, disappear., Cartesian,, rationalist, thought, still, strongly, influenced, the, French-speaking, world., Descartes, himself, wrote, little, on, artistic, topics,, even, in, his, Compendium, Musicæ,, and, he, is, even, doubtful, about, the, possibility, of, a, true, analysis, of, aesthetic, responses,, since, the, beautiful, and, the, pleasant, “mean, nothing, more, than, a, certain, relation, of, our, judgment, to, the, object, considered, and, cannot, have, any, determinate, measure”, (Letter, to, Mersenne,, March, 18,, 1630)., Nevertheless,, his, systematic, thought, had, consequences, for, the, field., This, is, clearly, noticeable, through, the, impact, of, the, mechanics, of, passions, in, facial, physiognomy, (Le, Brun), or, the, expression, of, moods, (Rameau)., Art, should, have, been, the, ideal, place, for, studying, the, “union, of, soul, and, body”,, though, this, union, didn't, come, first, in, rationalist, theories, of, art., Another, idea, that, played, a, role, in, the, continuing, development, of, aesthetics, is, the, relevance, of, classification, over, valuation., As, in, any, other, domain,, art, was, expected, to, be, structured, by, stable, categories, that, transcend, the, diversity, of, works, and, the, variability, of, human, attitudes., These, categories, have, in, fact, a, normative, rather, than, a, descriptive, scope., An, immediate, outcome, is, the, return, of, the, objective, question, of, the, beautiful,, apart, from, the, subjective, function, of, taste., A, significant, landmark, on, this, road, is, Crousaz's, Treatise, on, Beauty, (1714),, which, included, a, translation, of, Plato's, Hippias, major, as, an, appendix., At, first, sight,, it, seems, paradoxical, that, the, first, book, worthy, to, qualify, as, a, treatise, on, philosophical, aesthetics, in, France, was, written, by, a, logician, who, was, not, concerned, by, works, of, art, as, much, as, with, (criticism, of), scholastic, logic, and, pedagogy., Crousaz, is, convinced, that, men, are, happy, in, so, far, as, they, are, reasonable;, his, favorite, subjects, are, the, sciences,, eloquence,, and, virtue., When, Bernoulli, attacked, his, single, artistic, chapter, devoted, to, music,, he, replaced, it, in, the, 1724, edition, with, a, long, development, upon, religion,, a, subject, for, sure, closer, to, his, personal, abilities., For, him,, there, is, a, natural, continuity, from, mathematics, to, the, whole, conduct, of, human, life., Crousaz, does, not, offer, original, ideas, on, the, nature, of, the, beautiful;, he, takes, up, the, old, dictum, coined, by, Leibniz,, that, it, is, a, mix, of, unity, and, diversity,, so, as, to, preserve, order, and, proportion, from, both, caprice, and, monotony., But, he, approaches, it, with, a, new, awareness, of, the, constraints, and, prejudices, that, obstruct, the, way:, “Everyone, possesses, [an, idea, of, the, beautiful],, but, since, it, hardly, ever, appears, alone, we, do, not, reflect, upon, it, and, fail, to, distinguish, it, from, the, tangle, of, other, ideas, which, appear, alongside, it”, (AT,, 390)., The, root, of, this, difficulty, lies, in, the, duality, of, human, faculties:, “Sometimes, ideas, and, feelings, are, in, agreement, with, each, other, and, an, object, merits, the, qualification, ‘beautiful’, on, both, counts., Sometimes,, however,, ideas, and, feelings, are, at, war, with, each, other, and, then, an, object, pleases, and, at, the, same, time, does, not:, from, one, perspective, it, is, beautiful,, while, from, another, it, lacks, beauty”, (AT,, 392)., Crousaz, does, not, put, up, with, this, divorce;, on, the, contrary,, he, believes, we, have, a, responsibility, to, discover, “which, principles, regulate, our, approbation, when, we, judge, something, from, ideas, only, [or,, as, he, likes, to, say,, “coolly”], and, find, it, beautiful, independently, of, feeling”, (AT,, 393)., Taste, is, not, discarded, but, rather, viewed, as, a, forerunner, of, what, reason, would, have, approved,, had, it, time, enough, to, weigh, everything, relevant, to, a, judgment., Crousaz, finally, reconciles, knowledge, with, sensations,, a, fact, that, appears, to, testify, in, favor, of, God's, wisdom., Similar, ideas, are, also, to, be, found, in, minor, authors, such, as, Frain, du, Tremblay,, Brumoy,, or, Trublet., Father, André's, Essay, on, Beauty, (1741), covers, the, same, territory,, but, with, a, strong, influence, from, Malebranche., In, accordance, with, the, Cartesian, distinction, between, ideas, (innate,, adventitious,, and, fictitious),, André, suggests, several, notions, of, beauty., Essential, beauty, is, “independent, of, any, institution,, even, divine”, and, so, is, identified, with, what, is, universal,, immutable,, and, recognizable, by, divine, Reason., Natural, beauty, concerns, the, whole, range, of, created, things;, it, is, “independent, of, any, human, opinion”, but, follows, from, God's, will;, it, is, present, in, the, harmony, and, finality, of, nature., The, lowest, degree, of, beauty, is, the, product, of, human, activity, and, is, partly, arbitrary,, because, it, combines, intellectual, as, well, as, sensual, ingredients., This, sensible, beauty, that, speaks, to, the, eye, and, ear, is, itself, organized, into, three, levels:, genius,, taste,, and, caprice, (in, descending, order)., Only, genius, is, recognizable, by, our, reason,, when, the, latter, is, adequately, supported, by, other, faculties., André, summarizes, (in, a, sentence, that, could, have, been, written, by, Shaftesbury):, “I, call, beautiful, not, what, pleases, to, imagination's, first, sight, –, but, what, has, a, right, to, please, reason, and, reflection, by, its, own, excellence”, (Essay, on, Beauty, quoted, in, Becq, 1994,, 419)., For, him, (and, his, disciple,, Séran, de, la, Tour), there, is, no, distinction, between, beauty, and, truth,, and, this, is, the, very, definition, of, the, aesthetics, of, perfection., But, aesthetic, feeling, is, a, normal, affective, accompaniment, of, any, act, of, creation, or, reception,, and, the, distinguishing, feature, of, humankind, as, a, species., Charles, Batteux, had, somewhat, different, goals., When, he, published, The, Fine, Arts, Reduced, to, a, Single, Principle, in, 1746,, he, took, up, a, challenge:, to, establish, Aristotelian, ideas, firmly, as, the, general, basis, for, a, unified, system, of, the, arts., The, main, concept, on, which, he, focuses, is, mimesis,, but, generalized, to, any, kind, of, art, (thus, going, beyond, Aristotle, or, Horace)., To, achieve, this, generalization,, he, distinguishes, the, liberal, arts,, of, which, the, object, is, pleasure, (i.e.,, music,, poetry,, painting,, sculpture,, and, dance),, from, the, mechanical, ones,, and, he, proposes, an, interpretation, of, what, amounts, to, the, “imitation, of, the, beautiful, nature”, (Batteux, 1746)., He, insists, that, imitation, is, not, a, matter, of, slavishly, copying, the, given,, but, a, sensible, and, enlightened, process, that, struggles, its, way, forward, to, the, best, result., Recalling, the, famous, anecdote, of, Zeuxis, (who, composed, his, Helen, out, of, parts, taken, from, Crotone's, most, perfect, women),, he, concludes, that, the, artist, has, the, responsibility, to, imitate, what, reason, concludes, is, nature's, essence., That, is, why, Batteux, praises, artifice, so, much:, “art, is, made, for, fooling”, (Batteux, 1746),, not, because, it, is, inherently, duplicitous, but, because, truth, is, a, complex, construction, that, hides, its, structure, and, development., Batteux, notes, that, opera, is, “the, act, of, representing, a, marvelous, action., What, is, performed, on, the, stage, is, the, divine, in, the, epic”, (III,, 5,, p., 211-212)., C., Kintzler, offers, the, following, commentary:, “the, man, of, science, knows, how, to, explain, the, fabric, of, nature, and, mind,, the, man, of, art, knows, how, to, represent, these, mechanisms, on, stage,, and, the, man, of, taste, knows, how, to, be, delighted, by, the, illusion, involved”, in, her, book, on, Jean-Philippe, Rameau., So, taste, has, no, function, without, science, and, art,, but, in, return,, science, and, art, are, not, able, to, fulfill, their, function, without, taste., Though, sometimes, Batteux, is, criticized, for, his, stubborn, defense, of, excessively, rigid, standards, (as, in, his, Principles, of, Literature,, 1753), and, for, being, an, uncompromising, advocate, of, the, principle, ut, pictura, poesis, mentioned, above,, at, other, times,, he, is, recognized, for, grasping, that, the, ideal, is, not, to, be, found, anywhere, outside, fiction., It, is, also, important, to, mention, Jean-Philippe, Rameau,, who, passionately, adhered, to, Cartesian, thought., In, his, Treatise, on, Harmony, (1722),, he, attempted, to, lay, the, scientific, foundations, of, music,, and, codifies, many, of, the, ideas, that, are, the, basis, of, our, analysis, of, music, to, this, day, (i.e.,, tonality,, major, vs., minor, keys,, principles, of, composition, and, accompaniment,, etc.)., For, Rameau,, harmony, is, more, fundamental, to, music, than, melody., Nonetheless,, from, the, Demonstration, of, the, principle, of, harmony, (1750), on,, and, after, the, so-called, “Quarrel, of, Buffoons”,, where, Rousseau, took, him, to, task, (in, his, Letter, about, French, Music, 1753,, a, libel, in, favor, of, the, Italian, opera),, Rameau, retreated, to, the, certainty, that, music, is, the, universal, “key”, to, any, subject, whatsoever,, including, geometry., 4., From, Connoisseurs, to, Art, Critics, At, the, exact, opposite, of, so, toughened, a, theoretician, as, Rameau, lies, the, figure, of, the, connoisseur, which, anticipates, that, of, the, art, critic., Even, if, the, art, connoisseur, is, not, a, totally, new, personage, on, the, scene, of, art, practices,, his, role, is, going, to, become, increasingly, important, for, understanding, how, art, is, valued., Recognition, of, his, importance, is, correlated, with, a, subjective, encounter, with,, and, therefore, more, democratized, access, to,, artworks., This, is, facilitated, by, an, overall, evolution, in, the, historical, context, for,, when, patrons, ordered, great, decorative, paintings, and, frescoes, to, advance, their, rank, in, society, or, serve, the, cause, of, the, State,, their, decisions, were, not, always, reflected, in, personal, aesthetic, judgments., It, could, no, more, be, acceptable, from, the, perspective, of, the, art, critic., Moreover,, after, art, collections, of, royal, and, noble, origin, became, the, core, of, the, first, museums,, there, appeared, other,, less, ambitious, collections, accumulated, by, wealthy, amateurs, who, shared, a, mutual, taste, for, quality., Most, often,, these, collections, were, composed, of, drawings,, prints,, coins,, antiques,, and, plaster, or, terracotta, casts;, all, typically, items, less, expensive, and, easier, to, handle, than, sculptures, or, paintings., Among, the, most, famous, of, these, connoisseurs, were, the, financier, Crozat, and, the, Comte, de, Caylus., It, was, not, enough, for, them, to, collect, thousands, of, works;, they, were, also, concerned, to, index, them, and, reproduce, them, through, printmaking., The, Recueil, Crozat, (1729, and, 1742), is, the, true, ancestor, of, art, books, and, dictionaries, devoted, to, fine, arts,, which, began, to, multiply, (see,, e.g.,, Pernéty's, Dictionnaire, portatif,, 1757,, Watelet, and, Lévesque's, Dictionnaire, des, arts,, 1792,, and, especially, Mariette's, Abecedario,, posthumously, published, from, 1851–1860)., Catalogs, began, to, proliferate, and, the, first, monographs, appeared, (among, the, most, important, being, Recueil, Julienne,, Jean, de, Julienne's, collection, of, 271, engravings, after, Watteau's, paintings)., Caylus, and, Dezallier, d’Argenville, also, wrote, on, artists,, sketched, biographies, and, established, rules, of, discernment, for, the, delicacy, of, style, or, lightness, of, execution., All, this, took, place, in, the, larger, context, in, which, the, cosmopolitan, amateurs, of, different, countries, were, able, to, easily, travel, abroad., (Such, travels, evolved, into, the, nascent, ritual, of, the, Grand, Tour.), Another, factor, that, fostered, the, transformation, of, a, person, fond, of, art, into, an, authentic, connoisseur, able, to, make, refined, judgments, and, correct, attributions, was, the, institution, of, the, Salon,, i.e.,, official, exhibitions., The, Royal, Academy, of, Painting, and, Sculpture, had, been, founded, in, 1648, but, it, organized, very, few, exhibitions., Nevertheless,, a, series, of, lectures, –, first, public,, then, private, –, was, proposed, from, 1667, onwards., But, it, is, only, from, 1737, onwards, that, regular, shows, of, new, works, took, place, every, two, years,, covering, the, various, fields, of, visual, arts., The, existence, of, these, official, exhibitions,, or, Salons,, was, a, powerful, stimulant, for, artistic, activities,, notwithstanding, the, constraints, on, how, much, creativity, could, be, displayed., Though, the, Salon, was, first, a, political, and, social, event, that, was, inaugurated, for, about, one, month, in, the, Louvre's, Salon, Carré, on, August, 25th, –, St., Louis’, day--, to, pay, homage, to, the, king,, it, was, also, a, valuable, guide, for, tracing, the, major, trends, in, style, and, aesthetic, ideas,, for, lists, of, works, as, well, as, evolutionary, trends, in, pictorial, genres, were, taken, into, account., But, most, significant, consequence, of, the, rise, of, the, Salon, was, the, birth, of, a, new, literary, genre,, namely,, the, salon, review,, which, flourished, until, the, 20th, century, and, has, been, an, incomparable, mirror, of, aesthetic, thought., Originally,, such, reviews, were, just, a, blend, of, descriptive, reports, and, theoretical, asides,, often, controversial., The, “salon”, is, for, the, benefit, of, a, larger, public, (i.e.,, those, not, necessarily, affiliated, with, some, artistic, institution)., As, La, Font, de, Saint-Yenne, puts, in, 1747:, “an, exhibited, picture, is, the, same, as, a, book, on, the, day, of, publication,, and, as, a, play, performed, in, the, theater:, everyone, has, the, right, to, make, his, own, judgment., We, have, gathered, together, the, judgments, of, the, public, which, showed, the, greatest, amount, of, agreement, and, fairness,, and, we, now, present, them,, and, not, at, all, our, own, judgment,, to, the, artists,, in, the, belief, that, this, same, public, which, judgments, are, so, often, bizarre, and, unjustly, damning, or, hasty, rarely, errs, when, all, its, voices, unite, on, the, merit, or, weakness, of, any, particular, work”, (AT,, 555)., With, Caylus,, Baillet, de, Saint-Julien,, and, then, above, all, Diderot,, the, aesthetic, importance, of, painting, is, increasingly, emphasized,, opening, the, way, to, a, long, tradition, of, writers, keen, on, painting., The, growth, of, salon, reviews, was, the, result, of, new, demands, for, journalism, combined, with, the, rise, of, public, opinions, on, artistic, matters., Diderot's, German, friend,, the, philologist, Friedrich, Melchior, Grimm,, invited, him, to, contribute, to, the, Correspondance, littéraire,, a, bi-monthly, handwritten, letter, containing, news, and, criticism, of, Parisian, life, that, Grimm, prepared, and, disseminated, to, subscribers., Diderot's, first, attempt, in, 1759, was, a, rather, disappointing, paper, of, less, than, twelve, pages,, composed, of, notes, taken, during, his, visit., It, is, all, the, more, remarkable, that, he, succeeded, to, raise, this, exercise, to, perfection, in, his, reviews, of, 1763, and, 1767., Since, Diderot's, work, is, a, decisive, landmark, in, the, emergence, of, criticism,, it, is, worth, paying, some, attention, to, its, development., His, first, encounters, with, art, were, intellectual,, through, the, surveys, of, Crousaz,, Shaftesbury,, and, Hutcheson., He, attached, utmost, importance, to, the, theme, of, blindness, as, a, conceptual, paradigm, and, also, as, a, weapon, against, idealism., But, Diderot, was, not, only, a, passionate, philosopher, who, thought, about, the, relations, between, knowledge, and, vision,, he, was, also, an, enlightened, amateur, who, enjoyed, painting,, possessed, strong, likes, and, dislikes,, and, aimed, at, understanding., Diderot's, efforts, as, an, art, writer, were, based, on, two, complementary, beliefs,, namely,, that, the, techniques, used, by, a, painter, to, produce, various, effects, are, difficult, for, the, ordinary, viewer, to, understand, and, articulate,, and, that, it, is, a, difficult, but, vital, challenge, to, capture,, through, literary, language,, the, significant, aspects, of, a, painting., That, the, painter's, alchemy, eludes, the, viewer's, understanding, is, something, often, repeated, by, Diderot,, notably, with, respect, to, Chardin:, “It's, magic,, one, can't, understand, how, it's, done:, thick, layers, of, colour,, applied, one, on, top, of, the, other,, each, one, filtering, through, from, underneath, to, create, the, effect., At, times,, it, looks, as, though, the, canvas, has, misted, over, from, someone, breathing, on, it;, at, others,, as, though, a, thin, film, of, water, has, landed, on, it., …, Close, up,, everything, blurs,, goes, flat, and, disappears., From, a, distance,, everything, comes, back, to, life, and, reappears”, (1763,, AT,, 604)., Diderot, accepted, the, view, that, color, was, primary, in, painting, but, his, view, applies, to, the, effects, produced, in, drawing, and, to, what, separates, manner, from, mannerism., Though, he, confesses, that, he, praises, and, blames, after, his, personal, feeling, that, does, not, make, law, (1767), as, early, as, 1765, he, considers, that, his, acquaintance, with, works, gives, him, a, right, to, write, a, little, “Treatise, on, Painting”, to, air, his, reasons, for, confidence, in, his, judgments., At, the, same, time,, Diderot, is, aware, that, the, painter's, power, makes, it, extremely, hard, for, the, writer, to, give, his, reader, a, deep, grasp, of, a, painting., Despite, the, difficulty,, the, writer, must, somehow, express, the, essence, of, a, masterpiece,, thereby, achieving, a, kind, of, ekphrasis,, in, which, the, art, of, writing, attempts, to, capture, in, words, the, essence, and, form, of, the, visual, art, of, painting., The, critic, must, not, only, provide, the, reader, with, a, short, description, of, the, work, in, question,, but, must, attempt, to, make, his, words, somehow, equivalent, to, the, sentiment, expressed, by, the, painting, in, question., In, fact,, Diderot, generalizes, this, idea, of, capturing, one, mode, of, expression, by, means, of, another, under, the, phrase, ‘hieroglyph’,, which, was, first, mentioned, in, his, Letter, on, the, Deaf, and, Dumb, (1751), through, a, meditation, on, the, relation, of, knowledge, to, senses., Doolittle, characterizes, it, as, “a, suggestion, which, the, poet, makes, to, the, hearer's, understanding,, and, particularly, to, its, imagination,, by, means, of, sound, and, rhythm, in, conjunction, with, the, vocabulary, and, subject, matter, of, the, poem”, (Diderot, Studies,, 2)., Given, this, approach, to, art, criticism,, it, is, thus, understandable, why, Diderot, was, fascinated, by, the, ‘ocular, harpsichord’, imagined, (if, not, realized), by, Father, Castel,, by, which, a, musician,, when, striking, the, keys, on, a, keyboard, when, playing, a, piece, of, music,, would, not, only, produce, sounds, but, also, produce, colors, by, opening, curtains, to, colored, glass, panes., It, is, also, understandable, why, Diderot, had, an, interest, in, the, training, methods, of, education, devised, for, people, deprived, of, a, major, sense., Amongst, the, most, significant, literary, devices, used, by, Diderot, is, the, dialogue, form,, in, which, art, criticism, was, woven, into, real, and, imagined, dialogues,, with, the, interlocutor, sometimes, in, the, person, of, Diderot's, close, friend, Grimm,, mentioned, earlier, (see, Diderot, on, Art, II,, and, Sherman, 1976)., Some, of, these, dialogues, appeared, in, Grimm's, Correspondence, Littéraire, (also, mentioned, earlier)., The, brief, work,, Salon, de, 1775,, is, nothing, but, a, conversation, between, the, author, and, someone, named, ‘Saint-Quentin’., Saint-Quentin, was, highly, critical, of, the, art, works, in, the, Salon,, while, the, author, remained, the, reasonable, skeptic., Another, favorite, literary, device, that, Diderot, employed, was, a, narrative, that, unfolds, the, spatial, organization, of, pictures., A, combination, of, the, two, literary, devices, we’ve, been, discussing, appears, in, a, passage, devoted, to, the, artist, Joseph, Vernet,, in, which, the, dialogue, imagines, that, each, landscape, painting, is, a, real, site, discovered, through, walking, and, conversing, (see, Salon, of, 1767:, Diderot, on, Art,, Vol, II,, 86-129)., In, effect,, the, dialogue, partners, have, entered, the, work., It, is, only, at, the, seventh, and, last, site, that, the, deceit, is, revealed,, thereby, paying, homage, to, the, painter's, and, the, writer's, virtuosity., 5., Art, as, Philosophy, With, this, rise, of, art, criticism, and, aesthetics, in, 18th, century, France,, art, is, no, longer, merely, one, field, among, many, open, to, philosophical, questioning;, instead, it, becomes, a, model, of, development, for, other, domains, of, French, philosophy., During, antiquity, and, the, classical, age,, mathematics, played, this, role,, as, a, paradigm, of, intellectual, certainty, and, immutable, foundations., But, the, objects, of, study, and, investigational, techniques, of, mathematics, are, somewhat, limited, in, scope., The, 18th, century, saw, art,, art, criticism, and, aesthetics, raised, to, the, cultural, importance, of, science, and,, together, science, and, art, became, partners, for, society's, benefit., This, development, was, reinforced, by, progress, in, philosophy, itself,, such, as, through, the, impact, of, British, empiricism, and, the, growth, of, materialism., Cartesian, rationalist, principles, gave, way, to, the, suggestion, that, our, ideas, ultimately, originate, from, the, senses,, and, Condillac, and, d’Alembert, followed, Locke, in, this, regard., So, the, standards, of, beauty, and, taste, were, no, longer, imposed, by, reason, but, somehow, originated, and, evolved, from, our, judgments, as, human, beings, interacting, with, art, works., This, more, materialist,, and, sense-based, view, of, humankind, demanded, a, thorough, investigation, of, the, basis, of, society, and, the, ultimate, ends, of, life, itself., As, a, result,, the, frequent, analogy, between, works, of, art, and, living, organisms, proved, to, be, compelling., Between, the, Encyclopedists, and, Rousseau,, the, meaning, of, art, is, a, constant, subject, of, dispute, in, part, because, disagreements, about, the, nature, of, progress., There, had, been, a, rise, in, the, standard, of, living, and, Voltaire,, among, others,, celebrated, wealth,, luxury,, and, the, gentleness, of, life, they, permit., “What, a, good, time, this, iron, century, is!”, he, exclaims, in, the, Mondain, (line, 21)., Voltaire, interprets, the, developments, in, the, fine, arts, as, a, positive, consequence, of, progress, and, pleads, that, “where, several, of, the, fine, arts, are, wanting,, the, rest, must, necessarily, languish, and, decay,, since, they, are, inseparably, connected, together,, and, mutually, support, each, other”, (A, Philosophical, Dictionary)., Rousseau, however,, is, not, nearly, as, sanguine, about, progress,, given, the, persistent, inequalities, found, in, the, larger, society., As, a, result,, he, views, developments, in, the, arts, with, greater, suspicion, though,, at, the, same, time,, he, is, appealing, to, a, new, kind, of, relationship, of, art, to, nature, (Discourse, on, the, Arts, and, Sciences)., These, two, interpretations, of, art, have,, of, course,, their, corresponding, features, in, aesthetics,, which, sometimes, comes, across, as, the, attempt, to, critically, articulate, our, artistic, capacities, for, expression, and, sometimes, as, the, discussion, of, trifles, for, persons, of, leisure., Voltaire's, and, Rousseau's, supporters, nevertheless, agreed, on, the, kinds, of, advantages, art, offers, for, humanity, as, a, whole;, all, of, them, thought, that, it, was, a, task, of, aesthetics, to, make, these, advantages, explicit., The, debate, often, mentioned, three, points:, the, ways, in, which, art, increases, our, sensitivity,, the, way, in, which, art, makes, us, more, sociable,, and, the, way, in, which, art, develops, our, potential, for, invention., In, so, far, as, the, arts, mobilize, the, whole, range, of, our, faculties,, they, improve, our, ability, to, discern, minute, distinctions, that, otherwise, would, go, unnoticed., Thus,, delicacy, of, taste, may, be, cultivated, not, only, for, one's, own, pleasure, but, also, for, the, other, consequences, it, affords., Interactions, with, art, help, to, educate, a, culture, to, have, a, more, refined, sensibility., This, is, important, for, the, whole, of, human, life., Nevertheless,, concept, of, sensibility, undergoes, a, strong, shift, during, the, 1770s., In, quick, succession, two, pieces, of, writing, destined, to, gain, a, prominent, influence, were, published:, the, French, translation, of, Burke's, A, Philosophical, Enquiry, into, the, Origins, of, our, Ideas, of, the, Sublime, and, Beautiful, (by, the, Abbé, des, François), and, the, entry, ‘Sublime’, in, the, Encyclopédie, written, by, Chevalier, de, Jaucourt., The, most, conspicuous, feature, of, the, sublime, is, the, unexpected, feeling, of, a, violent, suspension, of, our, whole, experience, when, confronted, with, contradictory, forces., In, order, to, define, it,, the, philosopher, Claude, Helvetius, had, used, words, that, concur, with, Burke's:, “the, sensation, of, a, terror, begun”, of, which, delight, is, a, decisive, constituent, (A, Treatise, on, Man,, Section, VIII, Ch., XIV,, p., 232)., Whereas, the, beautiful, gives, rise, to, a, sentiment, of, harmony, with, the, world, and, oneself,, the, sublime, manifests, itself, through, a, sudden, transformation, of, the, self, into, something, deprived, of, its, usual, landmarks., Since, works, of, art, are, often, a, reflection, of, society's, ideals, and, prejudices,, art, becomes, an, effective, means, fostering, socialization., Chabanon, is, convinced, that, music, could, contribute, more, than, any, other, art, to, human, concord., Diderot, makes, a, similar, point, by, reference, to, theater,, which, is, less, a, place, for, amusement, than, a, microcosm, of, society, and, therefore, a, laboratory, for, civil, passions., So, it, is, no, surprise, if, Voltaire, can, write, in, return, that, “nothing, renders, the, mind, so, narrow,, and, so, little,, if, I, may, use, that, expression,, as, the, want, of, social, intercourse;, this, confines, its, faculties,, blunts, the, edge, of, genius,, damps, every, noble, passion,, and, leaves, in, a, state, of, languor, and, inactivity, every, principle,, that, could, contribute, to, the, formation, of, true, taste”, (AT,, 532)., In, brief,, art, helps, us, to, communicate, with, one, another, and, facilitates, a, more, socially-connected, culture., Another, decisive, feature, of, art, is, the, way, in, which, it, increases, our, potential, for, invention., This, could, be, interpreted, negatively, as, the, idea, that, social, life, and, human, nature, includes, an, unending, quest, for, novelty., But, in, a, more, positive, light,, art, provides, a, model, of, invention, that, fulfills, mankind's, highest, aspirations, and, abilities,, and, creates, a, route, from, our, most, primitive, drives, to, our, most, substantial, accomplishments., Art, therefore, realizes, Leibniz's, contention, that, ars, inveniendi, is, more, closely, related, to, games, than, to, more, serious, matters, (Letter, to, Bernoulli,, January, 29,, 1697)., In, any, case,, productive, imagination, and, genius, often, help, the, artist, carry, through, her, projects., Thus,, the, genius, often, found, in, art, works, has, less, to, do, with, some, ‘sparkling, touch’, found, in, them, than, in, the, fact, that, their, qualities, help, us, to, reconsider, things, anew, and, from, a, fresh, point, of, view., If, art,, therefore,, increases, our, sensitivity,, makes, us, more, sociable,, and, develops, our, potential, for, invention,, then, aesthetic, education, is, essential, for, accelerating, mankind's, development., This, idea, is, a, common, thread,, sometimes, implicit,, sometimes, explicit,, which, runs, all, through, the, 18th, century,, from, Shaftesbury, to, Kant, and,, above, all,, Schiller., An, important, consequence, of, an, aesthetic, education, is, the, enhancement, of, one's, ability, to, combine, analysis, and, imagination., No, doubt, such, a, frame, of, mind, was, a, component, of, pre-revolutionary, thinking,, though, it, is, doubtful, that, the, French, Revolution, as, an, historic, episode, had, the, kind, of, effect, that, its, first, defenders, hoped, for., 6., An, Age, of, Transition, Aesthetics, in, the, last, third, of, 18th, century, France, saw, developments, in, divergent, directions,, most, of, them, being, based, either, on, dissatisfaction, with, the, present, or, on, a, premonition, of, a, new, order., In, art,, we, find, a, revival, of, the, “Grand, Manner”,, which, historians, call, “Neo-Classicism”, and, which, replaced, the, excesses, of, rococo., But, the, most, significant, trends, in, aesthetics, lie, in, a, renewed, contact, with, the, legacy, of, Antiquity, and, in, a, pre-romantic, aspiration, for, a, more, sincere, kind, of, sensibility,, often, towards, nature, itself., The, renewed, contact, with, the, legacy, of, Antiquity, was, rather, visceral,, for, it, followed, a, sequence, of, archaeological, excavations,, first, at, Herculanum, and, Pompeii, (reported, in, Cochin, &, Bellichard, 1753,, Winckelmann, 1762,, and, Caylus, 1752),, and, then, in, Athens, and, in, Egypt., The, spectacle, of, towns, unearthed, from, cinders, and, of, magnificent, monuments, strewn, on, the, ground, had, a, great, deal, to, do, with, this, new, awareness, of, Antiquity., Lots, of, books,, often, enriched, with, engravings,, combined, a, sentimental, look, at, the, archeological, remains, with, a, revisionist, history, that, assessed, Greece, as, the, true, origin, of, ancient, artistic, output., A, new, kind, of, history,, art, history,, is, born, at, this, time;, Winckelmann,, for, example,, in, his, History, of, Ancient, Art, (1764),, developed, such, a, history., His, work, compiled, an, epic, of, forms, that, gives, us, insight, into, past, civilizations,, not, just, a, collection, of, anecdotes, such, as, one, would, find, in, Vasari's, Lives., Artists, such, as, Anton, Raphael, Mengs, and, Jacques-Louis, David, were, particularly, inspired, by, Greek, art, and, consequently, shunned, all, excesses, of, the, day, in, favor, of, simple,, austere, grandeur, in, both, subjects, and, attitudes., But,, from, an, aesthetic, point, of, view,, the, most, significant, trend, in, this, period, is, the, growing, debates, about, museology., In, the, middle, of, the, century,, the, first, great, museums, opened, to, the, public, (the, British, Museum, in, 1759,, the, Uffizi, in, 1765)., But, France, was, behind, its, neighbors,, even, if, royal, collections, were, more, accessible, than, before., The, first, suggestion, for, creating, a, gallery, in, the, unoccupied, Louvre, goes, back, to, 1747, and, was, reiterated, in, 1765, in, the, eponymous, entry, in, the, Encyclopédie., The, museum, finally, opened, in, 1793,, but, there, was, still, uncertainty, as, to, whether, it, should, be, an, academy, of, local, masterpieces, or, a, wide, overview, of, art's, historical, development., During, the, Napoleonic, campaigns,, famous, statues, were, transferred, from, Italy, to, Paris, (the, Belvedere, Apollo,, the, Medicis, Venus,, the, Laocoön,, to, mention, only, the, most, renowned)., This, policy, was, criticized, as, early, as, 1796, by, Quatremère, de, Quincy, in, his, Letters, to, Miranda., For, better, or, for, worse,, the, practice, prevailed, under, the, leadership, of, Vivant, Denon,, at, least, from, 1803, to, the, French, defeat, at, Waterloo., No, entry, on, 18th, century, French, aesthetics, is, complete, without, some, discussion, of, Rousseau., In, his, fiction, as, well, as, in, his, autobiographical, writings, Rousseau, advocated, that, his, heart, “transparent, as, crystal”, (Dialogues,, II), and, eager, for, sympathetic, communication, with, others,, freed, from, verbal, ambiguities, and, anticipating, modern, theories, of, empathy., This, may, have, naturally, evolved, from, the, strong, passion, for, music, he, developed, as, a, young, man., His, Letter, on, French, Music, (1753), was, a, contribution, to, “The, Quarrel, of, the, Bouffons”, over, the, merits, of, French, and, Italian, music., He, wrote, in, the, Letter:, “Harmony,, having, its, principle, in, nature,, is, the, same, for, all, nations,, or, if, it, has, some, variations, they, are, introduced, by, those, in, the, melody;, thus,, it, is, from, melody, alone, that, the, particular, character, of, a, national, music, must, be, derived.”, However,, Rousseau, thought, that, music, must, not, be, judged, solely, on, the, basis, of, symphonic, and, operatic, works,, but, also, on, the, basis, of, the, songs, and, dances, found, in, popular, festivals,, such, as, the, songs, and, dances, at, harvest, time,, when, the, participants, merge, into, a, single, community., For, Rousseau,, an, exemplary, musical, form, was, the, melodrama,, a, play, in, which, human, voice, and, gestures, are, combined, with, instrumental, accompaniment, as, the, action, advances., His, own, contribution, to, this, form, was, Pygmalion,, written, in, 1762, and, first, performed, in, 1770., For, a, discussion, of, how, Rousseau's, musical, theory, is, connected, with, views, he, developed, in, social, and, political, philosophy,, see, Scott, 1998., Finally,, it, is, worth, mentioning, how, the, concern, for, nature, that, developed, in, the, 18th, century, led, in, part, to, the, Romanticism, of, the, 19th, century., From, a, genuine, fondness, for, botany, there, arose, a, new, way, to, look, at, gardens., Again,, the, British, paved, the, way, by, inventing, landscape, gardening, as, a, form, of, “painting”, with, nature., The, Marquis, de, Girardin,, the, Baron, de, Monville,, the, Prince, de, Ligne, (all, readers, of, Rousseau), competed, with, the, famous, models, in, Britain, and, landscaped, their, properties, accordingly,, using, symbols, of, the, picturesque,, such, as, the, building, of, artificial, ruins., Further,, explorers, set, out, to, navigate, or, tame, the, remaining, unknown, natural, terrains., H., -B., de, Saussure,, for, example,, was, the, first, mountaineer, to, reach, the, top, of, the, Mont, Blanc., That, was, in, 1760., By, publishing, a, description, of, his, journeys, in, the, Alps,, he, was, an, important, forerunner, of, the, genre, of, travel, writing., Despite, the, many, precursors, to, Romanticism,, France, was, not, a, fertile, terrain, for, this, new, development., Instead,, while, Romanticism, took, hold, in, Germany, and, England,, there, was, a, period, of, decline, in, French, art, and, aesthetics,, made, even, worse, by, its, isolation, due, to, internal, upheavals., It, isn't, until, the, late, 19th, century, that, we, see, a, true, renewal,, when, Baudelaire, established, the, stature, of, Delacroix, and, laid, the, foundations, of, a, theory, of, modernity., Bibliography, A., Major, Original, Works, available,
