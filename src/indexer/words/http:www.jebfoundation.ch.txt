Southeast, Asia, Indonesia, Japan, Burma, Nepal, Tibet, Cambodia, Thailande, Close, Jacques-Edouard, Berger,, born, in, 1945,, died, unexpectedly, of, a, heart, attack, in, the, fall, of, 1993,, midway, in, a, career, which, had, taken, him, by, then, to, the, four, corners, of, the, earth., From, his, earliest, years, on,, his, life, had, been, totally, absorbed, by, the, pursuit, of, art, and, beauty., During, a, period, as, a, curator, of, the, Museum, of, Fine, Arts, in, Lausanne,, he, was, already, active, in, organizing, exhibitions, and, writing, many, articles, and, prefaces., But, the, world, at, large, beckoned, and,, leaving, his, moorings,, he, set, out, and, spent, many, months, each, year, in, traveling, all, over, the, world., He, was, particularly, attracted, to, the, ancient, civilizations, of, Egypt,, China,, India,, Indonesia,, Japan,, Cambodia,, Laos,, Thailand,, Burma,, etc.,, yet, never, neglected, his, European, heritage, as, mirrored, and, celebrated, in, countless, museums, and, galleries, in, Europe, and, the, United, States., As, the, artistic, leader, and, guide, of, numerous, groups, of, eager, admirers, with, whom, he, shared, his, vision, and, insights,, he, succeeded,, over, time,, in, creating, a, collection, of, well, over, 125,000, color, slides,, his, own, photographs,, capturing, the, masterpieces, that, quickened, his, emotions., In, turn,, this, unique, treasure, of, his, personal, discoveries, served, to, illustrate, and, animate, the, series, of, lectures, he, would, give,, between, travels,, to, an, ever, growing, following,, lectures, that,, in, focusing, on, the, powerful, revelation, hidden, in, the, works, of, art,, sought, to, provide, a, veritable, initiation., Two, books, "Pierres, d'Egypte", and, "L'oeil, et, l'éternité", also, attest, to, this, original, approach, and, the, acumen, of, his, intuition., The, profound, sorrow, and, distress, caused, by, his, untimely, death, prompted, number, of, his, friends, and, admirers, to, create, the, Foundation, that, bears, his, name, and, whose, principal, purpose, is, to, promulgate, the, discovery, and, love, of, art., World, Art, Treasures, is, a, great,, new, undertaking, to, meet, this, challenge., In, addition, to, the, initially, offered, display, successive, programs, are, in, preparation., They, will, deal, thematically, with, the, civilizations, of, Egypt,, China,, Japan,, etc., The, important, personal, collection, of, rare, artifacts, will, become, the, subject, matter, of, special, programs., "There, are, men, who, have, molded, our, consciousness:, Confucius,, Buddha,, Plato,, Saint, Augustine,, Leibniz,, Newton,, more, recently, Tagore,, Einstein,, Bohr., There, are, works, of, art, that, have, affected, our, vision, to, the, point, of, transforming, our, way, of, perceiving, the, world., Events,, men, and, their, creations, have, thus, fashioned, History., But, are, not, our, creations,, and, more, precisely, our, works, of, art,, the, most, intricate, and, faithful, evidence, of, our, mutations, ?, ", Close, The, act, of, collecting, has, lead, to, many, analyses, --, anthropological,, historical,, financial, and,, above, all,, psychoanalytical., All, these, studies, --, which, acquired, their, first, letters, patent, in, Cicero's, speeches, denouncing, Verres,, or, in, Pliny's, commentaries, with, respect, to, the, taste, the, Romans, cultivated, for, Greek, works, of, art, --, are, both, illuminating, and, unsatisfying., They, only, imperfectly, translate, what, incites, a, being, to, need, to, possess, objects, chosen, according, to, very, specific, criteria,, and, even, more, clumsily, what, qualifies, these, collections, of, objects,, each, in, its, own, singularity., In, other, words,, neither, the, act, nor, its, result, can, be, totally, understood., I, am, now, addressing, nonspeculative, collections,, motivated, by, other, reasons, than, those, of, the, market., The, history, of, art, is,, of, course,, rich, in, large, collections, which, were, constituted, for, financial, reasons, or, to, acquire, prestige., In, these, cases,, there, remains, a, mystery, about, the, selection, of, art, as, the, goal, of, a, personal, achievement,, either, for, profit, or, the, acquisition, of, rank., It, is, undoubtedly, easier, to, collect, real, estate, or, stock, market, securities,, not, an, entirely, risk-free, undertaking, to, be, sure,, but, one, which, calls, for, other, qualities, than, the, essential, one, of, vision., But, speculative, collections, --, which, we, shall, call, those, collections, which, have, other, goals, than, the, simple, possession, of, the, coveted, object, --, have, this, in, common:, the, selection, can, be, delegated, or, even, shared, between, several, decision, makers., The, final, proof, of, this, was, very, recently, seen, in, the, invention, of, artistic, investment, companies,, a, phenomenon, which, grew, out, of, the, exuberant, art, market, of, the, 1980s., But, well, before, this, explosion,, history, contains, many, examples, of, delegated, collections,, with,, sometimes,, it, is, true,, a, significant, relationship, of, aesthetic, complicity, between, the, scout, or, beater,, who, does, the, spadework,, who, discovers,, reports, and, proposes., Nonspeculative, collections, cannot, be, delegated., They, are, the, result, of, an, impulse, which, directs, the, collector, toward, the, object,, which, he, alone, can, distinguish,, and, which, he, jealously, keeps, to, himself., In, this, process,, or, tropism,, there, is, no, question, of, delegation,, sharing, or, barter., To, the, extent, that, this, type, of, collector,, if, he, requests, advice,, does, it, less, to, be, truly, counseled, than, to, put, his, own, determination, to, the, test;, that, if, this, collector, should,, moreover,, accept, an, object, as, a, gift,, he, will, only, truly, appropriate, it, as, his, own, if, he, had, the, prior, intention, of, acquiring, it, --, albeit, with, less, pleasure, than, if, he, had;, that, this, collector, will, only, divest, himself, of, a, piece, of, his, collection, for, certain, reasons,, which, are, never, primarily, financial,, but, always, emotional., The, disavowal, of, an, old, purchase,, viewed, now, as, a, youthful, error,, the, need, for, more, rigorous, selection, criteria,, a, faulty, investment, of, desire, in, an, object,, or, other, similar, motives,, which, can, all, be, viewed, as, the, inability, of, the, object, to, be, sacrificed, to, respond, to, its, owner's, imagination., The, exception, to, this, dynamic, is, also, emotional,, when, a, collector, divests, himself, of, a, beloved, object, --, a, very, symbolic, act, --, to, someone, who, then, can,, for, a, short, time,, share, not, the, collection,, but, the, associated, fantasy., These, few, introductory, lines, tend, to, confirm, the, psychoanalytical, theories, which, have, been, advanced, about, the, collection, phenomenon., The, emotional, investment, in, the, act, of, collecting, is, undeniable;, moreover,, it, supports, terms, which, reinforce, this, aspect., The, collector, "possesses,", he, is, "avid,", he, is, "jealous.", He, is, moved, by, "desire.", These, few, terms, suffice, to, establish, the, range, in, which, the, "impulse,", evoked, above,, is, expressed., In, addition,, in, the, case, of, collections, of, works, of, art, --, and, not, found, objects, --, they, are, put, together, with, money., One, pays, to, possess., There, are, too, many, clues, which, effectively, corroborate, the, psychoanalytical, theories, for, them, to, be, denounced., The, act, of, collecting, is, truly, a, diversion,, a, substitution,, a, sublimation, or, a, perversion, of, instinctive, and, emotional, needs., Having, established, this,, what, can,, however,, be, qualified, is, the, nature, of, the, transfer, that, takes, place, as, a, function, of, the, collections, and, collectors., Although, it, was, in, his, youth, that, he, assembled, his, first, objects,, Jacques-Edouard, Berger, had, not,, at, that, time,, "started, a, collection.", He, had, other, intentions., Along, the, way,, he, gathered, fragments,, vestiges, and, traces, of, human, industry, which, caught, his, eye., Without, discrimination, as, to, period,, technique, or, function,, the, slightest, object, endowed, with, the, grace, that, enables, a, portion, of, the, veil, to, be, lifted,, thereby, revealing, the, aesthetics, of, a, moment, or, a, society's, thought, process,, like, a, partial, reflection, glimpsed, in, a, mirror,, delighted, him., It, is, true, that, what, delighted, him, even, more, was, the, fact, that, he, was, capable, (perhaps, he, alone), of, perceiving, an, object's, beauty,, of, understanding, its, message, and, of, singling, it, out, from, its, peers., A, rococo, console, element, in, the, form, of, a, scroll,, a, Directoire, sign, on, painted, sheet, metal,, an, art, deco, paperweight,, sometimes, lost, amongst, meager, secondhand, articles,, which, immediately, called, out, to, him,, as, though, there, were, a, visual, language, of, desire,, the, codes, of, which, he, alone, knew,, but, which, one, might, be, tempted, to, think, was, emitted, by, the, object, itself,, some, sort, of, radiation., In, this, constant, exchange, with, the, sign-bearing, objects,, collecting, was, not, the, goal,, but, the, act, of, buying, came, from, the, collector's, fantasy., Traveling, only, reinforced, this, quest, for, the, invested, object., Jacques-Edouard, Berger, then, discovered, other, vestiges,, bearers, of, new, messages, about, cultures, of, an, even, rarer, happiness,, because, they, were, less, obvious., At, the, frontiers, of, the, European, domain, or, the, Mediterranean, Antiquity,, vast, regions, of, thought, and, sensation, stretched, out,, ready, to, be, discovered,, penetrated,, acknowledged, and, integrated., Much, as, the, Tibetan, shaman's, smock, opens, the, imagination, to, new, hypotheses, on, the, channels, of, meditation, which, guide, Man, in, his, quest, for, holiness,, so, the, miniature, clay, model, of, an, abode, from, the, great, Chinese, era, offers, a, more, pragmatic, vision, of, the, hereafter., Amongst, the, regions, of, thought, which, Jacques-Edouard, Berger, explored,, two, civilizations, were, to, play, a, predominant, role:, first, Egypt,, then, China., The, road, of, life, traveled, with, Jacques-Edouard, as, a, companion,, an, accomplice, and, a, witness, to, his, passion, allowed, me, to, share, Egypt, with, him,, but, never, China., It, is, thus, only, regarding, Egypt's, immensity, that, I, can, convey, the, memories, which, form, the, basis, for, these, thoughts., Traveling, with, Jacques-Edouard, was, not, merely, a, physical, displacement, ., From, the, time, of, the, first, Egyptian, experiences, in, the, early, 1960s,, the, adventurous, amateur, who, chose, Voyages, for, Art, as, a, means, to, an, end,, soon, realized, that, at, the, expense, of, making, an, effort, to, give, up, comfort, and, at, the, price, of, some, fatigue, --, at, that, time,, Egypt, was, not, equipped, for, tourism, as, it, has, been, since, the, 1980s, --, what, Jacques-Edouard, was, offering, was, not, exactly, tourism,, but, a, spiritual, journey., The, body, moved,, was, hot,, was, thirsty, and, suffered, various, ills;, in, return,, however,, it, was, buffeted, by, immense,, emotional, shocks:, another, culture's, exoticism., By, this,, I, mean, contemporary, Egypt,, which, Jacques-Edouard, knew, not, to, gloss, over, but,, on, the, contrary,, to, help, in, comprehending, and, perceiving,, to, living, in, communion, with, the, revelation, of, its, beauty,, violent, in, the, contrast, of, its, landscapes,, in, the, intensity, of, its, light,, vibrating, under, a, heat, which, one, could, not, even, think, of, escaping., After, these, "student", trips,, always, organized, during, the, high, summer, months,, which, covered, the, entire, Nile, Valley, for, as, much, as, a, month,, one, came, home, with, dry,, chapped, skin, and, a, ravaged, stomach,, but, already, filled, with, the, irrepressible, desire, to, leave, again, to, recapture, the, visual, and, spiritual, fulfillment, which, Jacques-Edouard's, Egypt, offered,, this, unique, sensation, of, having, come, face, to, face, with, a, personal, truth,, well, within, any, concept, of, culture., Jacques-Edouard, did, not, "guide", Egypt,, he, "saw", it, and, "talked", it., Led, by, his, vision,, the, privileged, traveler, slowly, penetrated, the, mysteries, of, a, complex, civilization,, based, on, different, values, than, those, to, which, the, West, has, given, importance., The, "knowledge", of, the, difference,, however,, is, only, possible, if, one, accepts, the, notion, of, otherness., Jacques-Edouard, spoke, to, this, when, he, introduced, one, to, Egypt, as,, for, him,, it, was, life's, essential, experience., The, ability, to, recognize, this, difference, led, Jacques-Edouard, very, far, in, the, comprehension, of, what,, for, many, learned, people,, remains, in, the, domain, of, objective, acquisition., His, knowledge, was, also, certainly, fed, by, much, reading, and, culture., But, scholarship, was, never, anything, more, than, a, verification,, sometimes, a, posteriori,, of, another, sort, of, communion, based, on, vision, and, the, sensitive,, analytical, ear,, which, he, brought, to, emotions, and, the, clear-sightedness, provoked, by, the, vision, in, his, deepest, being, and, conscience., Thus,, an, Egyptian, temple, which,, for, the, majority, of, researchers, and, spectators,, remains, an, archeological, site, or, a, witness, to, history,, the, history, of, religions, or, of, art,, was,, for, Jacques-Edouard, Berger,, above, all, a, meeting, place,, where, archeology, and, history, are, forerunners,, but, not, the, finality, of, the, study., To, follow, him, into, the, great, courtyard, of, the, Temple, in, Luxor, did, not, only, mean, merely, to, appreciate, Amenophis, III's, admirably, designed, layout,, it, was, also,, above, all,, an, internal, perception, of, Egyptian, solar, space., In, our, rational, societies,, intuitions, are, signs, of, confusion., They, are, deemed, suspect, by, the, Academy, and, send, the, scholar, who, dares, suggest, them, into, exile., One, might, recall, the, ostracism, of, Schwaller, de, Lubitz,, the, Egyptologist, who, was, tempted, by, the, occult., To, some, extent,, and, paradoxically, in, view, of, the, success, his, lectures, enjoy,, Jacques-Edouard, Berger, has, suffered, the, same, penalty,, or, should, one, use, the, word, mistrust,, by, the, College, of, Egyptology., For,, in, this, contemporary, world,, the, function, of, knowledge, has, increasingly, become, a, type, of, military, strategy,, the, construction, of, bastions, of, specialization,, to, which, are, brought, the, illusion, that, they, will, protect, us, from, the, indescribable,, the, unrepresentable, and, the, full, complement, of, existential, fears, and, anxieties, which, naturally, accompany, it., But, has, humanity, ever, been, anything, more, than, a, lengthy, questioning, of, fate?, Were, these, civilizations, which,, today,, no, longer, exist, or, have, been, radically, transformed, by, modernity,, yet, still, so, important, for, our, roots,, exhumed, for, any, other, reason, than, the, need, to, anchor, in, history, the, concept, of, continuity, which,, alone,, makes, the, perspective, of, the, biological, term, of, any, future, life, acceptable?, Dead, languages,, vanished, civilizations,, the, terminology, bears, witness, to, the, implied, corollary:, "but, we, are, still, alive.", Is, it, then, justifiable, to, consider, Jacques-Edouard, Berger's, passion, for, the, past, as, an, inversion, of, this, relationship:, "I, accept, my, death,, but, I, know, that, nothing, of, humanity, really, dies, and, that, the, word, lives, on.", "Life,, health,, strength,, for, eternity!", --, the, few, hieroglyphs, needed, to, represent, this, invocation, are, nearly, always, present, next, to, the, pharaoh's, image., One, can, content, oneself, with, deciphering, them, and, recording, their, frequency., One, can, also, believe, that, they, are, still, useful, today,, and, this, is, undoubtedly, what, distinguishes, Jacques-Edouard's, approach, and, vision., By, reading, a, dead, language,, one, brings, the, past, to, life., Listening, to, what, it, has, to, say, is, to, engage, in, a, dialogue, with, a, still, extant, reality., In, this, way,, this, rare, privilege, of, an, encounter, was, established,, which, Jacques-Edouard, used, throughout, his, life, to, nourish, his, thoughts, and, activities., Jacques-Edouard, Berger, believed, that, the, word, from, the, past, was, transmitted, not, only, by, language,, but, by, works, of, art,, the, "vestiges", we, discussed, earlier., These, objects, were, not, mute,, but, rich, in, various, calls, for, attention., The, beauty,, the, physical, quality, was, certainly, one, of, the, aspects, that, caught, his, attention,, but, no, more, than, a, fracture,, a, chip,, a, mark, marring, perfection,, a, stigmata, of, an, object's, adventure, through, life,, which, says, much, about, the, precariousness, of, all, material., Magic, also,, which, he, respected,, as, he, had, never, succumbed, to, the, illusion, that, objects, from, these, civilizations,, even, uprooted, or, deteriorated,, had, lost, the, power, of, their, meaning,, nor, that, the, act, of, possessing, them, constituted, a, castrating, dominance., The, act, of, collecting, had, thus, become, justifiable, for, Jacques-Edouard, Berger, in, his, approach, to, the, past., Attentive, to, what, the, objects, had, to, say,, one, would, not, be, far, off, the, mark, in, saying, that, these, speeches, were, addressed, to, him, because, he, knew, how, to, listen, to, them,, and, that, he, had, been, chosen, by, the, object, as, its, place, of, abode, before, he, himself, had, made, his, choice., Endowed, with, very, fine, hearing,, he, sheltered, an, infinite, variety, of, witnesses, in, his, apartment,, thus, demonstrating, his, great, eclecticism., From, the, purest, classicism, to, the, most, fervent, baroque,, each, "communicating", object, found, its, place, and, its, relationship,, if, he, could, make, the, encounter, happen., The, fertile, marriage, of, intelligence, and, sensitivity, to, the, vestiges, of, the, past, allowed, Jacques-Edouard, Berger, to, assemble, a, very, particular, collection, characterized, by, its, aesthetic, quality,, accessibility, and, diversity, and, the, singularity, of, certain, choices., This, book, will, serve, as, its, catalogue, and, I, believe, it, will, make, one, aware, of, the, extraordinary, quality, of, the, author's, idea, of, vision, and, his, ability, to, recognize, the, essence, of, things, through, form, and, materials., Before, being, considered, as, the, manifestation, of, a, need, for, appropriation,, a, collection, of, this, type, must, be, viewed, as, an, act, of, mediation., A, goodly, number, of, the, objects, which, make, it, up, are,, in, fact,, substitutes., But, I, think, that, I, can, safely, say, that, they, are, not, substitutes, in, terms, of, compensation,, emotional, or, instinctual,, as, psychoanalysis, commonly, defines, them,, but, temporal, substitutes., Had, he, been, able, to, do, so,, Jacques-Edouard, Berger, would, have, collected, temples,, from, Abydos, to, Borobudur, to, Bramante's, Tempietto., In, his, experience, of, spiritual, life,, so, essential, to, him,, the, objects, in, his, collection, functioned, as, symbols, and, tools,, symbols, of, the, pact, made, with, eternity, and, tools, for, communication, with, the, otherness,, from, which, he, daily, drew, his, self-awareness., The, collection, pursues, and, will, continue, to, pursue, this, mediatory, function., It, will, bear, double, witness,, both, to, the, raison, d'être, of, the, people, who, preceded, us,, but, also,, and, this, is, perhaps, the, most, important, purpose,, to, the, nature, of, the, relationship, we, can, have, with, art., Jacques-Edouard, Berger's, collection, can, lead, us, toward, the, first, condition, for, communication,, bringing, into, play, not, only, vision,, oriented, in, a, specific, direction,, but, the, fertile, interaction, of, an, eye, which, knows, how, to, listen., In, our, modern, world,, invaded, by, universal, images, and, sounds,, where, often, contradictory, messages, smash, into, each, other, like, galaxies,, cultural, identity,, laboriously, built, up, since, the, 19th, century, on, historical, consciousness, in, which, the, function, of, the, monument, is, associated, with, the, principle, of, collection,, tends, toward, a, profound, modification, of, its, meaning, because, of, an, excess, of, information., Commensurate, with, the, planet-wide, distribution, of, messages,, with, the, computerized, nature, of, its, media,, these, take, on, a, different, "significance.", This, irreversible, dynamic, of, the, communication, society, is, not, only, a, system, in, and, of, itself;, its, consequences, for, the, individual,, his, spirit,, and, his, awareness,, which, are, still, difficult, to, measure, today,, are, undoubtedly, far, more, important, and, definitive, than, one, might, imagine., In, this, identity,, tending, toward, the, global,, the, individual, is, seeking, recognizable, signposts., A, first, answer, is, supplied,, he, believes,, by, culture., Culture,, however,, is, part, of, the, communication, system., Jacques-Edouard, Berger, was, aware, of, this., Although, a, user, of, this, system,, he, knew, how, to, maintain, his, mastery, and, utilize, it, to, pursue, his, spiritual, goals., A, cultural, guide, in, all, the, senses, of, the, term,, he, led, his, protégés, beyond, culture,, toward, art., His, travels, and, his, lectures, allowed, him, to, communicate, in, his, own, words, the, messages, he, heard, from, works, of, art., But,, before, communicating,, and, to, understand, the, murmuring, of, the, objects,, he, knew, that, he, had, to, remain, silent, in, order, to, listen, to, the, serenity, of, temples,, the, silence, of, materials,, and, the, mute, words, of, forms., For, those, who, know, how, to, remain, silent, and, listen,, the, collection, speaks, today, on, his, behalf., Claude, Ritschard, Close, Enigmas, in, Painting, Every, painting, is, an, enigma., No, matter, what, motif, the, artist, chooses,, the, artist's, eye, sees, beyond, the, limits, of, reality,, beyond, what, is, commonly, designated, as, "reality.", For, it, is, here, that, the, creative, adventure, has, its, starting, point:, Mont, Saint-Victoire, is, an, arid, heap, of, loose, stones,, but, Cezanne, transforms, it, into, a, marvelous, microcosm,, disclosing, stone, in, its, original, state,, shaped,, crumpled,, and, crushed, by, the, genius, of, the, creator, and, the, very, paste, of, his, brush., Herein,, then,, lies, the, true, miracle, of, art,, namely, that, of, turning, the, commonplace, into, the, sublime,, the, mediocre, into, the, absolute., Ingres's, Madame, Moitessier,, the, upper, class, daughter, of, a, high, ranking, government, official, (Water, and, Forests, Dept.),, was, no, doubt, a, good, wife, and, mother,, a, little, thick-, waisted, as, was, the, fashion, at, the, time,, with, a, placid, gaze, and, gestures, as, slow, as, her, passions., But, her, supreme, effigy, at, Washington, D.C.'s, National, Gallery, has, her, transformed, into, a, sovereign, Juno,, with, skin, so, smooth, that, centuries, of, wear, have, been, -, and, will, continue, to, be, -, unable, to, alter, her, deliberately, obvious, beauty., Other, paintings, are, just, as, enigmatic:, Fragonard,, for, example,, object, of, the, public's, adulation, for, his, masterful, depictions, of, frivolities,, is, known, to, have, abandoned, his, elegant,, rapid, and, often, caustic, brushstroke, in, order, to, transform, a, Fête, de, Rambouillet, into, a, dizzying, stroll, along, the, swirling, rapids, of, a, darkly, shaded, Styx., Or, Klimt,, master, of, the, Byzantine-Japonizing, effects, of, "Secessionist", Vienna,, who, was, wont, to, adorn, forest, and, glades,, flower, plots, and, rock, gardens, with, interlacings, as, skillful, and, shimmering, as, those, with, which, his, beloved, lady, friend, Emilie, Flöge, graced, her, suitors., In, one, case,, the, painter's, entire, career, remains, a, mystery:, Bosch, the, first,, whose, wild, visions, fuel, debate, among, critics, still, today., One, wonders,, are, these, the, fruit, of, troubled, sleep, or, psychotic, dreams?, Do, they, imply, hermetism, to, which, there, exists, a, key,, or, an, encoded, message?, In, a, far, solar, language,, Giorgione, remains, just, as, incomprehensible,, given, the, degree, to, which, he, had, assimilated, the, erudite, humanism, of, Venice,, whose, very, rules, we, have, since, lost., And,, finally,, El, Greco, comes, to, mind:, his, exaggerated, mannerism, can, certainly, not, be, attributed, to, a, defective, vision, but,, rather,, can, be, explained, as, an, expression, of, the, impact, of, a, cultural, clash, between, the, artist's, Cretan, and, Byzantine, origins, and, his, training, in, the, higher, spheres, of, the, Renaissance, in, its, prime., This, semester's, course, does, not, promise, to, answer, all, these, enigmas., Instead,, it, proposes, a, questioning, of, fifteen, works, in, their, original, context,, in, an, attempt, to, achieve, a, below-the-surface, understanding, of, them, in, the, light, of, their, era, -, the, ideas,, beliefs, and, cultural, contexts, connected, with, their, creation., A, 15th-century, native, of, Florence, would, not, have, the, same, approach, to, the, painting, of, his, time,, his, "contemporary, painting,", as, would, today's, museum, visitor., Consider, Botticelli, in, the, light, of, the, Medicis, at, the, height, of, their, glory,, the, rise, of, Cosimo, and, Lorenzo,, the, triumph, of, humanism,, the, Church, crisis, instigated, by, Girolamo, Savonarola's, first, sermons., At, the, time,, Botticelli, was, a, painter, upholding, a, new, ideal,, a, committed, ideal,, instead, of, merely, the, melancholic, bard, of, Madonnas, and, evanescent, nymphs., You, might, say, that, we, intend, to, take, a, "polyphonic, ", approach, to, art,, without, losing, sight, of, the, fact, that, enigma, characterizes, many, other, dimensions, of, art:, the, unstable, world, of, attributions:, the, question, of, how, it, is, affected, by, various, discoveries,, as, in, the, case, of, the, Louvre's, The, Concert,, first, attributed, to, Giorgione,, in, obedience, to, tradition,, and, recently, re-attributed, to, Titian;, iconography, and, its, mysteries:, the, question, of, how, to, identify, the, subject, matter, of, a, painting, with, respect, to, the, milieu, in, which, it, came, into, being,, as, in, the, case, of, the, major, landscape, /Summer,, from, The, Four, Seasons/, at, the, Louvre,, into, which, Poussin, -, succumbing, to, the, appeal, of, classicism, like, so, many, of, his, contemporaries, -, introduced, key, elements, stemming, from, the, myth, of, Orpheusand, Eurydice;, the, shadow, and, light, of, genius:, the, question, of, why, certain, artists, -, Bouguereau, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century,, for, instance, -, were, worshipped, as, demigods, of, painting,, only, to, fall, into, complete, oblivion, upon, their, death., Meanwhile,, others, -, Georges, de, La, Tour,, for, example, -, suddenly, reemerge, to, be, consecrated, well, beyond, their, wildest, lifetime, dreams., Close, The, splendors, of, the, Baroque, and, Rococo, Styles, The, history, of, the, Baroque, and, Rococo, periods, is, written, in, letters, of, marble,, jasper,, bronze,, and, stucco, in, all, the, capitals, of, the, newly, emerging, Europe:, in, Rome,, in, the, form, of, the, monumental, colonnade, built, by, Bernini, as, the, p, ropylaeum, to, St., Peter's;, in, Prague,, on, the, Charles, Bridge,, where, Braun,, Brokoff,, and, their, pupils, produced, a, multitude, of, effigies, of, the, patron, saints, of, Bohemia;, in, Vienna,, where, the, perspective, from, Schönbrunn, Castle, stretches, as, far, as, the, Gloriette, -, that, landmark, imperial, arcade, built, by, von, Hohenberg, as, a, symbol, of, the, infallibility, of, sovereigns;, in, Berlin,, Paris,, Madrid,, and, even, in, the, tree-shaded, valleys, of, friendly, Bavaria,, where, swarms, of, stucco, putti, sing, out, the, joy, of, celebrating, the, divine, order, of, all, things., The, centers, of, the, Baroque, style, are, disconcerting, to, visitors;, the, sheer, size, of, the, building, sites, and, the, audacity, of, their, design, can, leave, one, speechless., It, could, be, said, that, this, came, to, be, because, the, sun, was, at, its, zenith, during, the, 17th, century,, thanks, to, Louis, XIV,, and, because, the, lights, of, reason, crowned, the, reign, of, Louis, XV, during, the, 18th., We, are, almost, tempted, to, overlook, the, fact, that, in, 1660,, the, King, ordered, Pascal's, Provinciales, to, be, burned,, while, in, 1752,, his, successor, condemned, the, Encyclopaedia!, One, possible, conclusion, to, be, drawn, from, this, is, that, darkness, is, closely, related, to, light., Perhaps, Caravaggio, sensed, as, much, when,, at, the, dawn, of, the, century,, he, came, up, with, the, technique, of, chiaroscuro,, that, impassioned, duel, between, night, and, day, lying, at, the, very, heart, of, Baroque, drama., For, the, Baroque, style,, and, later, the, Rococo,, were, indeed, theatrical,, with, full, mastery, of, contrary, complementarities:, the, empty, exalts, the, full,, the, full, confers, resonance, on, the, empty;, scrolls, and, interlacemotifs, bring, the, pure, and, austere, verticals, and, horizontals, to, vibrant, life;, light, exorcizes, shadow;, goldmakes, white, reverbrate, to, the, point, of, incandescence., Fifteen, sites,, under, the, auspices, of, fifteen, key, works,, will, thus, inspire, us, to, travel, through, Europe,, from, Rome, during, the, reign, of, Sixtus, V, to, the, extravaganzas, of, Prussia's, Frederic, II,, with, a, few, specialstop, overs, of, a, particularly, unusual, or, appealing, nature,, such, as, the, Bethlehem, forest, area, in, the, heart, of, Bohemia,, where, a, masterful, sculptor, carved, tortured, rocks, into, faces, of, hermits, and, ascetics;, or, Villa, Palagonia, in, Sicily,, surrounded, with, legions, of, sniggering, and, grimacing, monsters, commissioned, by, an, enlightened, prince., On, the, way,, we, will, rediscover, those, absolute, masters, whom, we, all, too, often, forget,, and, who, also, played, a, major, role, during, their, time:, Zurbarán,, Velazquez,, Poussin,, Rembrandt, and, Vermeer., In, other, words,, the, history, of, the, Baroque, and, Rococo, styles,, too,, deserves, to, be, written, in, capitals!, Close, The, Keys, to, Looking, "In, the, words, of, Horace, some, two, thousand, years, ago,, "Painters, and, poets, possess, the, ever, constant, right, to, dare, everything.", Twenty, centuries, later,, his, remark, remains, strangely, valid,, for, painters, and, poets, have, retained, not, only, their, right,, but, their, mission, to, dare., The, privileged, nature, of, their, gifts,, which, we, commonly, refer, to, as, their, genius,, confers, upon, them, this, inevitable, and, seemingly, destined, power, to, constantly, adventure, beyond, the, everyday., In, so, doing,, they, sweep, us, along, with, them,, leading, us, towards, other, coun-tries,, opening, our, eyes, to, other, worlds., In, their, creative, surge, some, were, carried, by, the, enthusiasm, of, the, crowds,, of, their, friends,, of, theirpatrons,, at, times, of, a, whole, city., In, one, chronicle,, for, instance,, we, read, that, the, great, Duccio's, Maesta, Altarpiece, crossed, the, city, of, Siena, in, the, form, of, a, triumphal, procession,, on, its, way, to, the, artist's, studio, at, the, Town, Hall, where, it, was, to, be, installed., Later,, Raphael, painted, Julius, II's, Apartments, in, a, theretofore, unheard-of, atmosphere, of, celebratory, veneration., And, it, is, alleged, that, the, enthusiasticpainters, who, were, allowed, to, assist, Vermeer, did, so, as, if, participating, in, a, church, service., But, the, right, proclaimed, by, Horace, was, not, always, appreciated, with, such, serene, equanimity:, artists, often, tend, to, disconcert, their, contemporaries,, to, clash, with, their, traditions,, undermine, their, convictions., In, such, cases,, a, scandal, crops, up,, a, famous, scandal, which,, one, or, two, generations, later,, at, the, same, time, asserts, and, supports, its, author's, glory:, an, Empress's, fan, slap, to, Olympia's, bosom, was, enough, to, ensure, the, start, of, Manet's, posthumous, fame,, the, reproving, fainting, spell, of, a, Lady, in, front, of, Fuseli's, Macbeth, won, the, artist, the, jealous, respect, of, the, gentry., We, can, even, imagine, how, much, comment, Giotto's, implacable, message, to, the, Scrovegni, [cf, the, Scrovegni, Chapel, frescoes], must, have, aroused, atthe, time, among, the, faithful., Whether, subjected, to, praise, or, obloquy,, artists, and, their, works, are, both, the, catalysts, and, the, revealing, agents, of, our, society., Fifteen, major, painters,, fifteen, master, paintings,, are, the, focal, point, of, this, semester's, lectures., They, will, provide, keys, to, understanding, the, evolution, of, various, cultures,, the, intellectual, movements, in, various, societies,, the, reactions, of, artists, who, have, sometimes, been, friends, and, more, often, rivals,, the, turns, and, turnabouts, of, art, criticism, -, all, this, during, six, centuries, in, the, history, of, Western, cultural, awareness., Close, The, genius, loci, "No, one, denies, that, some, places, are, "inhabited.", The, astrological, events, celebrated, in, the, Room, of, Months, of, Ferrara's, Schiffanoia, Palace,, the, pathways, lined, with, sphinges, [lion-bodied, sphinxes], at, Tivoli's, Villa, d'Este, or,, further, away,, the, precious, pavilions, of, the, residence, of, Emperor, Qianlong, in, Peking's, Forbidden, City,, are, all, peopled, by, jinni., Visitors, lost, in, thought, as, they, stroll, through, these, sites, cannot, help, but, feel, their, presence, and, powers, from, time, to, time., Dream, power,, the, power, of, enchantment,, of, illusion..., Here, a, fountain,, reaching, sky-high,, with,, in, the, middle, of, its, miniature, cascades,, a, gilt-bronze, crown, bearing, the, fragile, flame, provided, by, eleven, candles;, there, an, honor, salon, with, a, classical, layout,, a, whole, section, of, which, collapses, thanks, to, a, miraculous, trompe-l'oelig;il, -, apocalypse, as, a, sort, of, joke;, or,, there, again,, the, play, of, shattered, mirrors, embedded, in, the, gold, of, the, stucco, work,, distorting, reality,, shattering, and, fragmenting, it,, recomposing, it, according, to, whim,, reflecting, it, ad, infinitum., At, such, times,, then,, the, genius, loci, awakens,, a, goblin, who, smiles, at, our, state, of, confusion,, laughs, at, our, apprehensions,, and, revels, in, our, pleasure., In, order, for, the, goblin, to, be, born,, in, the, fashion, of, the, mandrakes, in, the, fairy, tales, of, yore,, there, must, be, the, "alchemical", union, between, an, inspired, patron, -, emperor,, prince,, cardinal,, margrave, (all, those, whom, Voltaire, enjoyed, deriding, once, he, had, stuffed, himself, at, their, table),, or, simply, millionaire, -, and, an, artist,, that, is,, someone, capable, of, producing, the, sort, of, visionary, work, that, does, justice, to, the, laws, of, perspective, and, of, gravity,, someone, who, can, accomplish, miracles, -, in, short,, a, magician., Several, such, sites, exist, still, today,, and, they, have, lost, nothing, of, their, magic, spells., It, is, with, an, eye, to, discovering, fifteen, of, these, that, we, invite, you, to, join, us, this, semester., From, the, Renaissance, to, present, times,, from, nearby, Bavaria, to, the, furthermost, bounds, of, India, and, China,, we, shall,, in, successive, stages,, regain, the, sublime, privilege, of, dreaming., Close, Art, and, Civilzations, during, the, European, Renaissance, A, strange, idea,, indeed,, is, that, of, rebirth,, or, "renaissance"...Above, all,, the, term, is, two-faced:, reassuring, and, worrisome, at, once., Reassuring, inasmuch, as, it, encompasses, searches,, intuitions, and, illuminations, that, allowed, Western, man, to, forge, an, identity, to, which, heclings, still, today., But, worrisome,, too,, as, we, become, aware, in, our, museum, visits,, when, dialoguesbetween, various, works, bring, up, paradoxes, that, remind, us, of, just, how, fragile, that, identity, is., Nothing, could, be, more, solar, than, the, smile, on, the, Mona, Lisa,, nothing, more, lunar,, nocturnal, and, mysterious, than, that, on, Piero, di, Cosimo's, Venus., Yet, both, were, painted, during, just, about, the, same, year., Undoubtedly,, this, is, the, sort, of, paradox, that, gives, the, full, measure, of, the, greatness, of, the, Renaissance., Fifteen, masterpieces, -paintings,, sculptures,, goldsmith, pieces, -, will, guide, us, along:, each, one, will, reveal, an, interesting, aspect, of, our, approach., Thus,, Piero, Delia, Francesca's, Ideal, City, will, break, the, silence, of, its, deserted, squares, to, speak, to, us, about, perspective;, the, finery, on, Carpaccio's, Two, Courtesans, will, illustrate, the, tastes, developed, by, ducal, Venice, for, the, splendor, of, the, Orient;, and, the, salt-cellar, offered, by, Benvenuto, Cellini, toFrancis, I, will, serve, as, an, emblem, of, the, primacy, granted, by, artists, to, the, exhilarating, frenzy, of, ornamentation., Together,, we, shall, travel, the, cities, that, were, the, birthplaces, of, "homo, novus,", the, new, man:, Mantua,, Ferrara,, Verona,, Padua,, Venice,, Florence,, Rome;, there, we, shall, encounter, the, haughtiness, ofthe, patron-princes,, lawmakers,, tyrants, or, condottieri-, the, Gonzagas,, the, Estes,, the, Farneses,, the, Medicis-, side, by, side, with, those, who, immortalized, them:, Mantegna,, Botticelli, or, Bronzino., We, shall, view, the, famous, works, dedicated, to, them,, such, as, Paolo, Uccello's, San, Romano, Battle, scenes,, and, the, lesser, known, ones, such, as, the, sibyls, [Room, of, Sibyls], in, the, Casa, Romei, in, Ferrara,, creatures, who, -, it, is, rumored, -, caught, the, eye, of, Lucrezia, Borgia, when, she, sought, haven, at, that, peaceful, site., For, over, a, century, now,, we, have, been, questioning, the, Renaissance., But, despite, all, the, brilliant, works, this, has, inspired, -, by, Jacob, Burckhardt,, Bernard, Berenson,, Roberto, Longhi,, Andre, Chastel,, to, name, but, a, few, -, we, feel, sure, much, still, remains, to, be, discovered., Close, The, Forgotten, Pathways, Certain, events, have, proven, history-making:, the, unification, of, the, Indian, subcontinent, under, the, aegis, of, Emperor, Ashoka,, during, the, 3rd, century, BCE,, for, instance;, the, opening, of, the, Horse, Road, -, the, future, Silk, Road, -, by, the, Han, sovereign, Wudi;, or,, just, before, our, era,, the, battle, of, Actium, [31, BCE],, the, interview, on, the, Field, of, the, Cloth, of, Gold, at, Guines, [1520],, or, the, Declaration, of, the, Rights, of, Man, on, August, 26,, 1789., And, certain, figures, have, shaped, our, cultural, awareness:, Confucius,, Buddha,, Plato,, St., Augustine,, Leibniz,, Newton,, and,, closer, to, our, time,, Tagore,, Einstein,, Bohr., Then,, too,, certain, works, of, art, have, so, imprinted, themselves, in, our, minds, that, they, have, transformed, our, perception, of, reality:, the, pediments, by, Phidias, on, the, Parthenon;, the, journey, along, the, Ganges, carved, by, the, Pallavas, into, the, granite, hillocks, of, the, village, of, Mahabalipuram;, the, frescoes, by, Giotto, in, the, Scrovegni, Chapel, of, Padua;, the, Meninas, by, Velazquez;, and, up, to, Picasso's, Demoiselles, d'Avignon,, which,, in, 1907,, marks, the, birth, of, modern, art., Events,, people, and, works, are, the, stuff, of, history., But, are, not, our, creations,, and, more, precisely, our, works, of, art,, the, most, intricate, and, faithful, evidence, of, our, mutations?, The, bas-reliefs, of, the, Temple, of, Amon, in, Karnak, contain, all, the, unswerving, faith, of, ancient, Egypt;, Michelangelo's, Last, Judgment, in, the, Sistine, Chapel, contains, the, fears,, torments,, shadows, and, hopes, of, the, Renaissance, at, its, crisis, point;, all, the, way, to, today's, Grande, Arche, de, la, Defense,, reflecting, as, it, does, the, many, challenges, of, our, century., But, there, are,, too,, more, secret, works,, more, remote, sites., These, are, often, left, to, the, side,, erased,, as, if, the, very, singularity, of, their, message, is, enough, to, frighten, us, away, from, them., So, it, is, in, China,, where, every, year, thousands, of, visitors, visit, the, terraces,, courtyards, and, pavilions, of, the, Forbidden, City,, bedazzled, by, the, sacred, splendor, unfurled, there, by, the, last, of, the, Qing;, but, few, will, visit, Chengde,, yet, so, close,, where, dark, and, oppressing, temples, allow, all, the, anxieties, of, the, dynasty, to, well, up., So, it, is, in, India,, where, crowds, jostle, at, Udaipur, to, merge, for, a, fleeting, moment, with, the, dream-inspiring, white, marble, rendered, sublime, by, the, reflections, of, the, water;, yet, no, one, stops, off, at, Orchha, (by, the, way,, where, is, Orchha, ?),, as, arid, and, severe, as, it, arguably, is, but, so, revealing, of, the, spiritual, depth, of, the, Rajputs,, who, fiercely, rejected, all, the, affected, tastes, flaunted, by, the, royal, court., People, will, endure, hardships, to, reach, the, holy, site, of, Angkor,, while, forgetting, all, the, temples, that, the, Khmers, built, along, the, plains, of, today's, Thailand, and, Laos, -, temples, that, are, especially, fascinating, when, one, realizes, that, the, faces, of, the, gods, had, to, be, remodelled, to, fit, in, with, both, the, dogma, of, the, conquerors, and, the, secular, beliefs, of, the, latter's, subjects., This, semester, we, shall, explore, together, several, of, the, remote, valleys, where, History, allowed, itself, to, be, forgotten., Close, A, 2004, text, which, is, still, an, appropriate, introduction, to, the, genesis, of, the, World, Art, Treasures, project, 1994-2004:, Towards, a, new, World, View, -, René, Berger, (1915-2009), To, say, that, a, new, world, view, is, coming, into, existence, is, not, saying, much,, unless, we, hasten, to, add, that,, for, the, first, time,, the, view, in, question, is, truly, universal., Indeed,, it, is, not, rooted, in, any, of, the, outlooks, once, imposed, by, different, empires, of, the, mighty:, Egyptian,, Roman,, Chinese, or, even, Napoleonic., Nor, does, it, stem, from, any, religious, hegemonies,, whether, poly-, or, monotheistic., It, has, no, links, with, political, ideologies,, with, any, Marxist/Leninist, trends, of, the, sort, that,, at, one, point,, looked, like, they, would, dominate, the, world., And, it, is, equally, unrelated, to, the, neo-liberal, view, attached, to, the, globalization, that, is, a, direct, product, of, the, free, market, economy., At, another, level,, one, might, also, put, forward, some, connection, with, the, views, bequeathed, to, us, by, science,, such, as, the, rationalism, of, Galileo, and, Descartes,, in, conjunction, with, numerous, technical, inventions., The, latter, include, the, clocks, and, watches, which,, over, such, a, long, period, of, time,, lent, credence, to, a, mechanistic, view, of, the, world., Only, today, has, the, resulting, reductionism, gradually, begun, to, loosen, its, grip, on, us., In, short,, the, new, world, view, I, have, in, mind, has, nothing, to, do, with, the, "traditional", Weltanschauungen., It, comprises, no, new, representations, or, content, matter,, as, might, well, be, expected,, but, a, process, of, emergence, that, resists, definition, -, not, for, lack, of, information,, but, because, that, very, information, is, undergoing, massive, changes., As, circumstances, would, have, it,, the, whole, story, begins, with, a, man, -Tim, Berners-Lee,, a, consultant, with, the, CERN, -, and, a, dream:, the, dream, of, an, instrument,, the, "Web,", capable, of, linking, together, more, than, just, the, men, and, women, who, pioneered, the, Internet, for, military,, scientific, and, academic, purposes., Instead,, he, dreamt, of, a, "World, Wide, Web", for, the, population, in, general,, linking, person, to, person,, group, to, group,, anytime, and, anywhere, in, the, world:, "The, fundamental, principle, behind, the, Web, was, that, once, someone, somewhere, made, available, a, document,, database,, graphic,, sound,, video, or, screen, at, some, stage, in, an, interactive, dialogue,, it, should, be, accessible, (subject, to, authorization, of, course), by, anyone,, with, any, type, of, computer,, in, any, country., And, it, should, be, possible, to, make, a, reference, -, a, link, -, to, that, thing,, so, that, others, could, find, it.", (Weaving, the, Web,, Orion, Business, Books,, 1999,, p.40)., The, author, goes, on, to, underscore, the, philosophic, impact, of, this, undertaking:, "This, was, a, philosophical, change, from, the, approach, of, previous, computer, systems.", (ibid.), The, project, was,, and, to, this, day, remains, so, novel, that,, already, at, the, time,, Tim, Berners-Lee, felt, free, to, assert:, "Getting, people, to, put, data, on, the, Web, was, a, question, of, getting, them, to, change, perspective,, from, thinking, of, the, user's, access, to, it, as, interaction, with,, say,, an, online, library,, but, as, navigation, through, a, set, of, virtual, pages, in, some, abstract, space.", Hence,, it, is, the, interaction, between, the, "users", themselves, and, technology, that, constitutes,, not, the, content, of, the, view, but,, and, more, importantly,, its, raison, d'être, and, the, conditions, enabling, its, realization, as, a, living, experience., A, further, consequence, -, difficult, to, fathom,, let, alone, accept,, especially, for, authorities, of, all, stripes, -, is, not, so, much, that, the, Web, eludes, all, supervision,, as, some, were, quick, to, suspect, and, by, the, same, token, to, condemn,, but, that, it, escapes, that, supervision, by, its, very, nature, and, ambition:, "There, was, no, central, computing, 'controlling', the, Web,, no, single, network, ..., not, even, an, organization, anywhere, that, can, 'run', the, Web., The, Web, was, not, a, physical, 'thing', that, existed, in, a, certain, 'place'., It, was, a, 'space', in, which, information, could, exist.", (ibid, p.39), (the, single, quote, marks, are, my, own, emphasis)., Thus, the, Web, is, not, to, be, confused, with, a, data, base,, no, matter, how, gigantic, its, scope., And, even, if, it, can, be, used, for, all, the, classical, purposes,, which, it, then, augments, thanks, to, its, exponential, power, of, calculation,, it, can, never, -, and, this, is, worth, repeating,, given, how, deeply, ingrained, our, mental, habits, are, -, it, can, never, be, reduced, to, being, a, mere, extension, of, the, traditional, structures., In, short,, it, is, always, in, the, process, of, being, reinvented., Yet, someone, out, there, has, to, keep, track, of, the, latest, developments., The, review, Flash, Informatique,, created, to, fulfill, that, purpose,, offered, Jacqueline, Dousson, occasion, to, address, the, question, "Mosaic,, vers, une, nouvelle, culture?", (Mosaic,, towards, a, new, culture?), in, its, February, 1994, issue:, "Imagine, that, you, are, in, front, of, your, screen,, that, you, click, and, read, the, latest, news, bulletin, issued, by, the, Pittsburg, Supercomputing, Center,, that, you, click, again, and, consult, various, works, put, out, by, the, publisher, O'Reilly,, and, that,, with, still, another, click,, you, land, at, MIT?, Today,, this, is, a, reality,, you, can, access, all, that, and, much, more, still.", Dousson, went, on, to, point, out, the, decisive, role, belonging, to, Mosaic,, a, project, developed, by, the, NCSA, (National, Center, for, Supercomputing, Applications), in, Champaign-Urbana,, as, one, of, the, first, browsers, to, grant, the, masses, access, to, the, Web., And,, finally,, she, asked, "And, what, about, the, EPFL, (Ecole, Polytechnique, Fédérale, de, Lausanne), in, all, this?, Although, the, EPFL, has, already, finalized, its, presentation, 'for, the, initiated', (http://www.epfl.ch/, [...], the, goal, to, be, reached, is, that, from, no, matter, where, in, the, world,, by, being, linked, to, the, Internet,, one, will, be, able, to, know, what, the, EPFL, is,, what, is, being, done, there,, whom, to, contact.", Certainly,, at, the, time, of, the, article, -, that, is,, a, mere, ten, years, ago, (as, the, stipulation, "for, the, initiated", attests), -, no, one,, not, even, the, article's, author,, could, guess, that, the, "new, culture", to, which, a, question, mark, was, attached, would, not, only, develop, but, actually, change, the, course, of, the, entire, planet, with, its, explosion, of, ever, more, numerous, and, efficient, networks., No, one, except, a, Bill, Gates!, Noting, in, its, issue, of, November, 3,, 1994,, that, "the, emergence, of, Mosaic, and, the, World, Wide, Web, is, the, most, exciting, development, in, a, decade,"the, International, Herald, Tribune, goes, on, to, comment, with, remarkable, clairvoyance:, "Microsoft, has, already, begun, to, purchase, reproduction, rights, to, the, masterpieces, of, the, museums, all, over, the, world, to, produce, specific, CD-ROMs, on, art, (among, others, those, of, the, National, Gallery, of, London)., The, openness, of, INTERNET, through, WWW, is, one, way;, the, commercial, way, of, Microsoft, is, another., At, this, point,, it, is, not, to, me, to, judge;, both, are, surely, shaping, our, future,, but, questions, are, raised, and, initiatives, should, be, taken.", I, deliberately, draw, the, reader's, attention, to, this, last, highly, significant, remark., The, future, of, the, Internet, was, to, be, decided, on, the, basis, of, a, trend, characterized, by, heretofore, unprecedented, complexity., It, would, be, an, oversimplification, to, reduce, that, trend, to, mere, commercial, ends., By, painful, coincidence,, it, was, during, this, same, period, -, late, in, 1993, -, that, the, life, of, our, son, Jacques-Edouard, Berger,, born, in, 1945,, was, abruptly, interrupted, by, a, heart, attack., During, his, all-too-short, lifetime,, devoted, entirely, to, art,, his, thirst, for, knowledge, had, driven, him, almost, all, around, the, world., During, his, travels, he, collected, numerous, artworks, with, which, he, built, up, a, private, collection,, while, at, the, same, time, he, served, as, travel, guide, to, private, groups,, introducing, them, to, the, ancient, civilizations, to, which, he, was, particularly, attracted, -, Egypt,, China,, India,, Japan,, Burma,, Laos,, and, Thailand, -, together, with, a, good, number, of, locations, in, Europe, and, the, United, States., While, sharing, his, discoveries, and, enthusiasm, with, others,, he, unflaggingly, photographed, the, sites, and, works, encountered, along, the, way., He, thus, assembled, over, 100,000, slides;, these, he, subsequently, put, to, use, to, illustrate, his, countless, classes,, lectures, and, publications., In, the, words, of, Jacques-Edouard, himself,, "Are, not, our, creations, and, more, precisely, our, works, of, art, the, most, intricate, and, faithful, evidence, of, our, mutations?", The, prospects, offered, by, the, Web, at, that, very, time, having, come, to, our, attention,, it, was, thus, in, June, of, 1994, that, we, joined, forces, with, the, EPFL, -, in, particular,, with, Francis, Lapique, -, to, create, the, Web, site, "A, la, rencontre, des, trésors, d'art, du, monde, /, World, Art, Treasures.", From, the, outset,, we, noted:, "Taking, advantage, of, the, multidimensional, specificity, of, the, network,, our, intention, is, to, shed, a, new, light, at, the, same, time, on, art, itself, and, on, the, manner, in, which, it, is, contemplated., In, contrast, to, the, usual, manner,, consisting, mainly, in, establishing, data, banks, in, a, historical, or, documentary, vein,, our, goal, is, to, design, and, elaborate, a, different, approach, for, each, journey., [The, idea, is], to, take, into, consideration, and, underscore, each, time, one, particular, aspect, in, order, not, only, to, provide, information,, but, to, prompt, a, new, experience, in, harmony, with, the, new, technology.", Of, course, this, was, in, no, way, meant, as, a, stab, in, the, back, to, Bill, Gates, -, as, ridiculous, as, it, would, have, been, presumptuous, -, but, to, demonstrate, that, the, Internet, and, Web, encompass, a, variety, of, potential, pathways., That,, besides, the, economic, imperative, lurking, in, this, technology,, the, networks, offer, opportunity, and, room, for, spiritual, and, artistic, values, as, well., The, first, of, our, "programs", was, featured, on, the, Internet, as, early, as, July, 1994,, very, shortly, after, the, Web, and, the, browser, Mosaic, had, come, into, their, own., It, provides, an, overview, of, the, main, forms, of, artistic, expression, in, the, countries, so, well-traveled, by, Jacques-Edouard, (Egypt,, China,, India,, Japan,, Laos,, Cambodia,, Thailand)., The, second, program,, Pilgrimage, to, Abydos,, looks, to, the, Internet, as, a, means, of, allowing, visitors, to, relive, the, pilgrimage, taken, some, 3000, years, ago, by, Pharaoh, Seti, I, to, build, a, temple, bearing, his, name, at, Abydos,, one, of, the, meccas, of, ancient, Egypt, -, a, pilgrimage, that, Jacques-Edouard, Berger, himself, accomplished, numerous, times,, as, described, in, his, book, "Pierres, d'Egypte", (Stones, of, Egypt)., The, challenge, of, this, digital, approach, is, that, of, reconstituting, the, itinerary, of, a, pilgrim, not, only, in, abstract, and, intellectual, terms, but,, still, more,, one, could, say, "spiritually", and, "existentially":, The, trip, is, divided, into, successive, stages, leading, from, the, first, open-sky, room, all, the, way, to, the, secret, shrine, inhabited, by, Osiris,, Isis, and, Horus., In, other, words,, the, "pilgrims", visiting, the, site, are, invited, to, rediscover, the, process, of, being, initiated,, not, only, through, words, and, images, but, by, being, subjected, to, an, inner, experience, mirroring, their, virtual, stage-by-stage, screen, trip., The, paradox, here,, deliberately, and, duly, considered,, is, that, of, resorting, to, electronics, to, produce, a, progression, akin, to, an, actual, spiritual, experience., It, is, as, if, the, network,, by, freeing, itself, of, defined, space, -, or,, at, the, least,, from, the, primacy, of, a, space, where, signs, and, images, are, traditionally, inscribed, -, were, freeing, time, into, the, flow, of, an, initiatory, journey., As, if,, too,, it, were, rendering, perceptible, the, feeling,, or, intimation,, of, the, sacred., These, first, shared, treasures, soon, sprouted, a, whole, series, of, offshoots:, Roman, Portraits, from, Egypt, in, January, 1995,, Sandro, Botticelli, in, May, 1995,, A, Shared, Vision, in, December, 1995,, Enchanted, Renaissance, Gardens, in, March, 1996,, Vermeer, in, June, 1996,, Angkor, in, May, 1997,, Dizzying, Grandeur, of, Rococo, in, May, 1997,, Georges, de, La, Tour, in, September, 1997,, Borobudur, in, December, 1997,, Caravaggio, in, March, 1998, -, programs, that, are, already, past, history, in, the, light, of, all, the, subsequent, advances, in, technology., Surprisingly, and, endearingly,, right, from, the, start, this, innovative, undertaking, enjoyed, the, warmhearted, and, very, diversified, collaboration, of, a, wide, circle, of, friends., It, was, they, who,, among, other, things,, saw, to, the, digitizing, of, several, thousand, slides,, the, gradual, addition, of, legends,, and, the, researching, and, verification, of, all, the, sources., More, recently,, in, view, of, the, progress, in, the, software, realm,, they, have, also, seen, to, it, that, Jacques-Edouard's, lectures, could, appear, on, the, Internet,, treating, viewers, to, his, brilliant, commentary, viva, voce, on, various, subjects, of, his, choice, and, many, of, his, travels., Not, to, mention,, furthermore,, the, generous, and, dedicated, work, accomplished, by, the, members, of, the, Foundation, Committee,, including, the, much, appreciated, contributions, of, several, temporary, assistants., All, of, which, brings, us, to, the, site, as, it, exists, today:, "FONDATION, JACQUES-EDOUARD, BERGER:, World, Art, Treasures.", It, is, a, change, in, the, very, nature, of, the, link, that, lies, at, the, heart, of, the, transformation, taking, place, today., No, being,, from, the, simplest, to, the, most, complex,, can, survive, in, isolation., Links, are, the, sina, qua, non, of, our, existence,, of, all, existence:, endogenous, in, linking, together, the, component, parts, of, each, organism,, and, exogenous, in, linking, living, beings, among, themselves, with, their, environment., The, driving, force, behind, a, link, -serving, at, once, as, its, inspiration,, manifestation, and, realization, -, comes, down, to, what, could, be, termed, the, phenomenon, of, activation., In, a, nutshell,, links, exist, inasmuch, as, they, are, activated., That, is,, inasmuch, as, they, are, experienced, in, the, relationship, between, the, subject, and, the, "object", (thing, or, being), or,, more, exactly,, their, interaction., Now,, by, definition,, the, Web, serves, to, set, up, links, from, one, end, of, the, planet, to, the, other,, from, the, farthest, reaches, of, our, collective, memory, to, the, latest, news, of, the, day., And, this, with, anyone, at, all,, immediately,, everywhere?, So, that, at, present, we, have, a, situation, where, a, connection, experienced, in, real, time, establishes, a, virtual, world, -, a, world, no, longer, based, first, and, foremost, on, past, references,, as, has, been, our, habit, until, now,, but, one, that, emerges, at, the, same, time, as, the, link, comes, into, being., Hence, it, is, no, longer, necessary, to, depend, on, classical, tools,, methods, and, techniques, such, as, art, history, and, the, books, it, yields., The, Web, enables, the, creation, of, a, multimedia, field, in, which, we, can, at, once, immerse, ourselves, and, play, a, part., Here, lies, probably, one, of, the, most, significant, benefits, of, World, Art, Treasures:, The, adventure, on, which, the, site's, founders, first, embarked, has, now, become, an, ongoing, process, of, expansion, and, ever, more, in-depth, discovery., One, could, perhaps, even, go, so, far, as, to, say, that,, despite, his, physical, absence,, Jacques-Edouard, has, been, "brought, back, to, life", -, not, in, the, usual, sense, of, the, expression,, but, in, the, sense, of, a, kind, of, "cyber-existence", in, which, all, can, share., We, can, see, that, new, dimensions, are, emerging, from, our, present-day, world, and, its, accelerated, transformation., Today's, young, people, imply, as, much, when, referring,, for, instance,, to, our, exploration, of, Mars:, "Maybe, we, all, go, into, space, but, we, go, mentally,, virtually,, electronically., We, don't, go, with, our, bodies., As, the, technology, gets, better,, the, virtual, reality, could, get, quite, profound.", (International, Herald, Tribune,, January, 28, ,, 2004)., In, the, generations, to, come,, humans, will, have, to, be, in, a, constant, state, of, becoming., And, their, becoming, will, come, to, pass, only, if, they, link, up, with, others, to, accomplish, actions, interconnected, with, the, ever-growing, possibilities, of, the, new, technologies., RB, (janvier, 2004), Translated, from, the, French, by, Margie, Mounier,, March, 2004,  , Museum, Trip, Collection,
