[C , I , N , E , M , A, i, s,  , i, t,  , a,  , b, o, o, k, ?, A, little, Something, about, dreams,, memory,, and, the, Movies., "You, should, look, straight, at, a, film;, that's, the, only, way, to, see, one., Film, is, not, the, art, of, scholars, but, of, illiterates.", -, Werner, Herzog, This, morning, I, woke, up, remembering, a, dream, that, was, full, of, internal, repetition., Events, were, re-played,, slightly, differently, each, time,, and, I, knew, much, of, what, was, coming, --, as, an, actor, in, the, story,, as, narrator,, or, as, an, observer., In, this, particular, dream,, the, device, of, repetition, was, a, movie., I, was, watching, the, same, film, over, and, over, again,, or, living, in, it., Sometimes, I, was, actually, in, the, movie,, sometimes, I, was, in, a, theater, watching, it, on, a, screen,, and, sometimes, I, was, sort, of, on, the, set,, or, inside, the, screen,, as, the, movie, played., I, commented, on, this, repetition, as, part, of, my, dream., "Did, you, notice, that?,", I, asked, my, companion, as, we, walked, down, the, street, and, into, the, opening, sequence, of, the, film,, "I've, seen, this, [movie], ten, times, at, least, and, never, noticed, it.", Dreams, take, place, in, the, same, places, and, situations, again, and, again,, but, it�s, never, quite, the, same., I, have, several, "sets", for, dreams, that, I, use, over, and, over., For, example,, I, have, been, having, dreams, set, in, my, two, childhood, homes,, or, variations, of, them,, for, my, whole, life., My, mother, has, said, she, thinks, of, this, phenomenon, as, a, kind, of, rolodex, of, dreaming, situations, --, she, feels, that, each, night, her, mind, flips, through, the, different, scenes, or, situations, until, it, finds, one, that, is, useful, for, the, moment,, and, then, uses, it, for, her, dream., It, has, always, frustrated, me, that, the, dream, sequences, in, movies, are, so, often, inept., Even, the, great, cartoons, of, Warner, Brothers, didn't, always, capture, the, feeling, or, visuals, of, a, dream., But, recently,, a, friend, encouraged, me, to, go, to, a, movie, that, was, all, dream., "It, may, make, you, a, little, sick, to, your, stomach, with, the, shaky-cam,, but, it's, worth, it,", she, said., Waking, life, (directed, by, Richard, Linklater,, 2001), was, shot, using, live, action, on, film,, and, the, film, stock, was, then, used, to, create, an, animated, movie, (using, a, process, called, rotoscoping)., The, story, jumps, from, place, to, place,, repeats, itself,, and, gets, lost, in, tangents., It, does, not, have, a, beginning,, middle,, and, end,, in, the, traditional, sense., The, protagonist, wanders, through, some, scenes,, and, is, physically, absent, from, others., Waking, life, employs, several, nonlinear, techniques, at, once:, the, protagonist, wakes, each, day, and, discovers, that, he, is, still, dreaming, (circular, narrative);, conversations, or, stories, begun, in, one, scene, and, then, abandoned, are, taken, up, later, with, no, connective, thread, or, narrative, explanation, for, the, shift, (delayed, narrative);, and, story, threads, are, told, out, of, sequence, (shuffled, narrative)., There, are, a, few, feature-length, films, made, without, formal, narrative, structures, at, all,, but, which, are, instead, combinations, of, image,, sound,, movement,, music,, conversation,, or, text., No, doubt, the, most, famous, recent, examples, of, completely, non-narrative, film, are, Godfrey, Reggio's, Qatsi, trilogy:, Koyaanisqatsi,, or, "life, out, of, balance", (1983);, Powaqqatsi,, "life, in, transformation", (1988);, and, Naqoyqatsi,, "life, as, war", (2002)., Each, film, in, the, trilogy, features, images, (live, action,, still,, and, animated), combined, together, with, an, imposing, score, by, Philip, Glass., The, results, are, not, stories, or, linear, narratives,, but, something, more, like, interpretations, of, the, three, concepts, described, in, the, films', titles;, each, is, a, kind, of, disjointed,, spiral, path, through, a, sea, of, information., The, films, in, the, Qatsi, trilogy, are, dramatic, examples, of, nonlinearity, in, film, because, they, do, not, rely, on, the, narrative, storyline, to, provide, a, framework, for, their, content., This, shocking, departure, from, the, standards, of, the, medium, allows, us, to, appreciate, the, sort, of, structureless-while-structured, feel, that, the, three, films, have., It, is, possible,, of, course, to, make, a, film, that, has, no, narrative, and, yet, is, very, linear, (think, of, a, movie, composed, of, images, &, sounds, that, reflect, the, linear, order, of, an, alphabet, or, a, series, of, numbers,, or, images, in, motion, along, a, strip, of, empty, road)., However,, it, is, likely, that, many, viewers, would, experience, such, a, film, in, much, the, same, way, as, they, would, one, with, a, clearly, nonlinear, structure,, simply, because, it, would, be, out, of, the, ordinary., Many, films, employ, nonlinearity, in, their, structures, in, subtle, ways, that, we, hardly, notice, --, the, flashback, and, voice-over, techniques, discussed, below,, for, example,, are, very, commonly, used, in, all, kinds, of, films., Films, that, employ, nonlinearity, consistently, throughout, their, whole, length,, though,, stand, out., Some, methods, are, more, frequently,, or, more, successfully, employed, than, others., Circular, narrative,, for, example,, rarely, makes, it, into, mainstream, movies, --, perhaps, because, it, doesn't, often, fit, neatly, into, the, sort, of, plot, Hollywood, is, used, to, producing., One, unusual, example, is, Groundhog, day, (directed, by, Harold, Ramis,, 1993)., The, movie's, protagonist,, a, cynical, television, reporter,, wakes, up, each, morning, to, face, the, same, day,, February, 2nd,, over, and, over., The, reporter, is, able, to, predict, the, events, that, will, take, place, throughout, the, day,, and, manipulate, them, slightly, through, his, own, behavior,, but, nothing, seems, to, shake, him, from, the, time-loop, in, which, he, has, become, stuck., Another, rarely, used, technique, is, that, of, "branching, paths,", in, which, more, than, one, ending, to, the, story, is, provided,, sometimes, depending, on, the, circumstances, of, a, particular, screening, of, the, film, (similar, in, format, to, the, Choose, your, own, adventure, books, discussed, in, our, Literature, section)., One, well-known, example, of, this, technique, is, Clue,, a, film, based, on, the, popular, murder, mystery, board, game, of, the, same, name., Three, endings, were, made,, and, different, versions, were, shown, at, different, screenings., When, the, video, was, released, it, was, cut, with, all, three, endings, after, the, main, body, of, the, film., Clue, was, somewhat, of, a, commercial, flop, (quite, deservedly,, many, would, argue),, and, the, technique, has, largely, been, ignored, by, mainstream, filmmakers., Delayed, and, shuffled, narrative, are, evident, in, countless, other, films., Some, tell, two, stories,, beginning, to, end,, with, the, scenes, from, the, two, story, lines, shuffled, together, but, still, in, chronological, order., Others, tell, one, story, in, linear, time,, with, another, unfolding, out, of, chronological, sequence., Some, are, simply, one, linear, story, with, flashback, scenes, to, another, story, or, time., Still, others, show, elements, of, several, stories, at, once,, in, an, order, created, more, for, narrative, coherence, than, as, a, reflection, of, the, passage, of, time., A, few, good, examples, are:, The, conversation, (directed, by, Francis, Ford, Coppola,, 1974),, The, French, lieutenant's, woman, (directed, by, Karel, Reisz,, 1981),, Tampopo, (directed, by, Juzo, Itami,, 1987),, Jacob's, ladder, (directed, by, Adrian, Lyne,, 1990),, Pulp, fiction, (directed, by, Quentin, Tarantino,, 1994),, Lone, star, (directed, by, John, Sayles,, 1996),, Out, of, sight, (directed, by, Steven, Soderbergh,, 1998),, and, Thirteen, conversations, about, one, thing, (directed, by, Jill, Sprecher,, 2001)., One, widely, employed, mechanism, for, shuffled, narrative, is, the, voice-over,, in, which, a, voice, emanating, from, off, screen, narrates, part, of, the, story,, bridging, the, gaps, between, one, part, of, the, narrative, and, another., This, connective, thread, is, always, invested, with, perspective, of, the, character, who, narrates, --, often, this, provides, an, ironic,, fatalistic,, or, sorrowful, angle, on, the, story., Voice-overs, are, often, used, to, link, flashback, scenes, to, the, rest, of, the, story, line,, and, the, two, are, often, used, in, combination, (particularly, in, film, noir)., Much, of, the, time,, this, combination, is, very, subtle, --, The, lady, from, Shanghai, (Orson, Welles,, 1948),, for, example,, begins, with, a, scene, in, which, we, see, the, main, character,, Mike, O'Hara,, walking, through, Central, Park, in, New, York, City., As, he, walks, through, the, park, and, meets, a, beautiful, woman,, O'Hara's, disembodied, voice, explains, that, the, world, of, trouble, he's, got, himself, into, started, here,, seeing, this, woman, for, the, first, time., The, narrative, thread, begun, in, Central, Park, continues, on, screen., Occasional, commentary, by, O'Hara,, in, voice-over, from, off, screen,, makes, up, a, second, narrative, thread;, the, two, together, give, us, the, whole, story., Occasionally,, the, combination, of, voice-over, and, flashback, is, very, complex., The, usual, suspects, (directed, by, Brian, Singer,, 1995), opens, with, the, explosion, of, a, small, freighter, docked, in, harbor,, and, then,, over, a, black, screen, the, voice, of, Roger, "Verbal", Kint, begins, to, describe, the, hijacking, of, a, truck, full, of, gun, parts, in, New, York,, six, weeks, before, the, ship, explosion., The, story, of, the, hijacking, and, related, events, unfolds, on, screen,, interspersed, with, voice-overs, of, Verbal, tidying, up, the, bits, of, the, story, neatly., Eventually,, Verbal, is, shown, in, a, police, station, interview, during, the, investigation, of, the, ship, explosion,, still, describing, events, leading, from, the, hijacking, to, the, explosion., Throughout, the, film,, the, scenes, flash, back, and, forth,, showing, short, pieces, of, Verbal's, story,, occasional, deep, background, as, he, explains, complicated, situations,, and, eventually,, brief, scenes, of, Verbal, being, interviewed., The, tale, of, theft,, drug, smuggling,, police, corruption,, and, international, criminal, intrigue, is, intricate, and, difficult, to, follow,, but, we, are, lead, easily, through, the, mess, because, Verbal, takes, us, by, the, hand, with, his, narrative., In, fact,, the, flashback, scenes, are, very, much, Verbal's, own, story,, told, with, his, unique, perspective,, motives,, and, understanding., In, contrast,, the, scenes, in, the, police, station, where, he, is, being, interviewed, are, shown, from, a, "third, person", sort, of, perspective., If, we, can, take, it, as, given, that, what, we, see, in, the, police, station, is, objective, fact,, the, rest, is, merely, the, unreliable, story, of, a, criminal, under, pressure., The, double, narrative, is, thus, emphasized, both, by, the, content, of, the, story, and, by, the, method, in, which, it, is, told., Some, other, examples, of, films, using, these, two, techniques, together, are:, Citizen, Kane, (Orson, Welles,, 1941),, Double, indemnity, (directed, by, Billy, Wilder,, 1944),, The, postman, always, rings, twice, (directed, by, Tay, Garnett,, 1946),, All, about, Eve, (directed, by, Joseph, L., Mankiewicz,, 1950),, Sunset, Boulevard, (directed, by, Billy, Wilder,, 1950)., Interestingly,, flashback, techniques, are, completely, conventional, in, documentary, filmmaking., In, the, standard, format,, the, narrator, talks, in, voice-over, while, images, of, the, final, result, of, the, story, flash, across, the, screen,, and, then, we, are, brought, back, through, time, to, the, story's, roots, with, documentary, footage,, stills,, or, re-created, footage., Often, an, expert, provides, scientific,, intellectual,, or, political, analysis, of, the, subject, of, the, film, (usually, from, an, official-looking, location,, like, a, book-lined, office),, with, the, visuals, occasionally, switching, back, to, the, chronological, beginning, of, the, story., I, don't, even, need, to, provide, you, with, examples, to, make, this, point, --, we've, all, seen, these, techniques, in, action., But, I, have, an, especially, well-crafted, example, in, mind:, The, thin, blue, line, (directed, by, Errol, Morris,, 1988)., The, movie, tells, the, story, of, Randall, Adams,, on, death, row, for, murdering, a, Dallas, police, officer., The, story, Morris, presents,, through, interviews, with, the, prisoner,, witnesses,, and, police, investigators,, is, illustrated, with, re-created, footage, of, the, events, in, the, case,, told, over, and, over, with, details, and, conclusions, provided, by, each, person, interviewed., (Amazingly,, the, film's, argument, that, the, evidence, against, Adams, was, thin, and, entirely, circumstantial, was, so, successful, that, he, was, later, released.), Stories, told, literally, backwards, provide, a, particularly, bizarre, experience, for, the, uninitiated, moviegoer., Memento, (directed, by, Christopher, Nolan,, 2000), is, the, story, of, a, man, who, has, lost, his, short-term, memory, and, who, lives, only, in, the, moment,, but, who, is, obsessed, with, finding, his, wife's, killer., The, movie, begins, with, the, chronological, end, of, the, story, and, progresses, backwards, in, chunks, of, a, few, scenes, at, a, time,, with, occasional, flashbacks, to, earlier, chronologies., Harold, Pinter's, play, Betrayal, (made, into, a, movie, in, 1983,, directed, by, David, Hugh, Jones),, uses, a, similar, mechanism, to, tell, the, story, of, an, extra-marital, affair,, only, backwards,, from, the, break-up, to, the, first, attraction, a, few, years, earlier., Each, of, these, films, takes, a, familiar, story, (man, loses, his, wife,, searches, for, her, killer, and, seeks, revenge;, man, has, an, affair, with, his, best, friend's, wife), and, literally, turns, it, upside, down., Betrayal's, narrative, turns, a, sad, story, into, a, relatively, happy, one., The, ending, (the, lovers, break, up, bitterly), is, at, the, beginning., And, the, first, days, of, the, affair,, in, which, the, excitement, of, a, forbidden, attraction, blocks, out, any, feelings, of, guilt, or, betrayal,, are, placed, at, the, end, of, the, movie,, leaving, viewers, happy, for, the, lovers, but, shaking, their, heads, about, the, inevitable, sad, ending, to, the, affair., Memento, is, a, mystery, story,, but, because, the, clues, are, scattered, through, the, story, backwards, (for, the, most, part),, unraveling, the, mystery, is, confusing., In, a, sense,, though,, Memento, is, no, different, from, any, classic, murder, mystery, --, the, narrative, begins, with, a, dead, body,, and, progresses, back, along, the, trail, of, clues, to, the, murder, itself., The, big, difference, is, that, in, this, movie,, the, narrative, literally, reverses, time., The, protagonist's, memory, loss, creates, for, him, a, unique, world,, in, which, nothing, lasts, for, more, than, a, few, minutes,, and, a, new, reality, can, be, created, in, a, single, stroke., The, film's, backwards, linear, sequence, yanks, the, viewer, into, the, past, (though, it, feels, like, the, future, while, watching, the, film),, each, segment, overlapping, a, little, with, the, next, as, the, movie, progresses, backwards, in, time., Intermittent, flashback, scenes, are, peppered, through, the, story, --, the, majority, are, in, black-and-white, and, are, narrated., Their, story, progresses, forward, chronologically, as, the, movie, progresses., There, are, other, flashback, scenes, which, appear, in, no, discernable, order,, confusing, things, further., Together,, these, pieces, form, a, complex,, fragmented, structure, that, simulates, the, disconnected, world, of, the, protagonist., Memory, is, somewhat, of, an, obvious, theme, for, such, a, clearly, nonlinear, story, as, Memento,, but, the, film, uses, it, in, an, unusual, way., The, illustration, of, memory, is, one, of, the, most, common, incidences, of, nonlinear, narrative, and, structure, in, film,, usually, in, the, flashback, sequence, (Citizen, Kane,, All, about, Eve,, Lone, star, and, The, thin, blue, line, use, this, mechanism, extensively)., Memento, is, all, flashback,, since, the, story, progresses, from, present, backwards, into, past, (which, then, becomes, present,, making, the, beginning, of, the, film, seem, more, like, future)., But, since, Memento's, protagonist, does, not, have, the, ability, to, create, new, memories, for, himself,, the, jumps, backwards, are, not, reportage, of, his, memories, of, his, own, experience., Instead,, they, are, sections, of, his, life,, doled, out, to, the, viewer, in, a, manner, that, gives, us, a, sense, of, his, experience, of, the, world., (Interestingly,, a, later, DVD, release, of, the, film, includes, a, function, which, allows, it, to, be, viewed, in, standard, chronological, order.), Memories, are, obviously, nonlinear, in, structure, --, we, can't, remember, an, event, until, after, it's, happened,, which, means, our, memories, are, always, out, of, linear, sequence., They, are, also, somewhat, fictional, --, memories, of, an, event, contain, only, those, elements, of, the, original, event, that, seem, relevant, or, important, to, the, person, remembering., My, memory, of, the, dream, I, discussed, at, the, beginning, of, this, essay,, for, example,, is, limited, to, the, pieces, that, seemed, most, compelling, to, me, when, I, woke, up., And, because, dreams, are, so, thoroughly, unlike, the, experiences, we, have, while, we're, awake,, I, had, to, give, my, dream, a, structure, to, support, its, different, pieces, when, I, woke, up, and, tried, to, tell, myself, the, story, of, my, dream., The, closest, approximation, I, could, manage, was, a, circular, narrative., I'm, left, wondering, if, my, interpretation, of, the, dream, would, have, been, different, if, I, lived, in, a, different, cultural, context, --, with, more,, or, fewer,, examples, of, nonlinear, stories., --, written, by, Emily-Jane, Dawson,, 2002, The, cinema, section, of, our, Bibliography, includes, complete, citations, for, the, films, discussed, in, this, essay,, as, well, for, other, films, that, employ, nonlinearity, (though, it, is, by, no, means, a, complete, list)., It, also, lists, books,, articles,, and, websites, that, touch, on, nonlinearity, in, film, or, discuss, movies, mentioned, here., Irate, in, nylon:, Lean, tiny, iron,, Lair, on, ninety,, Oil, any, intern, Foyer, |, History, |, Literature, |, Comix, |,
