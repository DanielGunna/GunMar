intelligence, and, unique, perspective, on, the, world., We, all, have, this, preconceived, notion, of, the, dumb, jock,, a, stereotype, that's, a, staple, in, every, teen TV, show,, movie and, especially, all, those, cheerleader, flicks, I, used, to, catch, at, the, Drive-In., But, today's, experience, got, me, thinking, about, my, own, high, school, athletic, career --, which, to, be, perfectly, honest, consisted, mostly, of, going, to, Gym, Class, --, which, every, kid, in, my, first, year, of, high, school, detested., This, was, not, because, Phys-Ed, (as, it, was, known, back, in, the, day), took, place, in, some, dank,, musty, gymnasium, with, flickering, halogen, lights, and, a, drafty, change, room., Nope,, we, had, a, brand, new, school, with, state, of, the, art, amenities., What, made, us, hate, it, was, --, along, with, your, text, books, you, had, to, buy, a, gym, uniform,, which, consisted, of, really, short, white, shorts,, a, white, T-shirt, with, the, school, logo,, sneakers, and, --, a, jock, strap,, which, none, of, the, 14, year, olds, I, hung, out, with, had, ever, seen, before., The, waitress, at, the, Woolworth's, lunch, counter, even, yelled, at, us, for, pulling, them from, the, boxes, they, came, in, to, check, them, out, while, waiting, for, our, post, shopping, burgers, and, cokes., This, "uniform", meant, that, not, only, did, you, have, to, get, naked, in, front, of, a, bunch, of, other, guys, twice, a, week, when, you, had, Phys-Ed, (or, four, times, because, you, had, to, get, both, in, and, out, of, your, jock, strap, for, each, class);, but, you, had, to, stay, naked, for, 15, minutes, at, the, end, of, the, class, while, everybody, crammed, into, a, communal, shower., I, guess, this, was, the, school's, way, of, making, sure, we took, at, least, two, showers, a, week., But, still..., On, top, of, that,, the, Gym, teacher, was, a, guy, who, liked, to, yell, a, lot, and, clearly, had, interest, in, whatever he, was, supposed, to, be, teaching, because, he, had, football, or, basketball, plays, to, think, up., This, changed, about, midway, through, the, year,, when, the, lady, gym, teacher, took, over, to, teach, us, some, gymnastics., Not, only, did, she, know, her, stuff,, she, looked, really, good, showing, us, how, to, do, it., Although, that, meant there, were, some, who, had, to, take, a, little, extra, time, to, cool, down, before, we, hit, the, showers, --, if, you, know, what, I, mean., But, it, turned, out, gymnastics, was, actually, something, I, was, good, at, and, some, of, us, even, ended, up, doing, presentations, of, "gymnastic, skills", on, Parents, Nights, or, when, somebody, notable visited., The, Gym, Lady,, a, real, keener, wanted, to, start, a, team, to, compete, with, other, schools., But, somehow,, that, never, happened, and, a, year, or, so, later,, I, was, just, too artsy, and, theatrical, for, that, sort, of, thing, --, and, besides,, the, really cool, guys, didn't, want, to, be, thought, of, as, jocks., As, coincidence, would, have, it,, one, of, the, social, media, feeds, I, checked, after, today's, revelation, of, the, true, nature, of, jocks,

whipper-snappers, this, week,, I, mentioned, that, I, was, pretty, sure, Ted, Nugent, had, been, on, the, same, bill., Which, wouldn't've, caused, that, much, consternation in, the, 1970's but, struck, these, guys, as, extremely, unsavory., "The, gun, freak, hunter, guy?", Well,, yeah., But, back, then, Ted, was, pretty, much, a, guitar, freak, hunting, little, more, than, some, "Wango, Tango"., But, I, digress...., Driving, home, I, considered, how, much, Ted, and, others changed, over, the, decades,, while, some, like, Sir, Elton, changed, hardly, at, all, --, save, for, maybe,

Those, women, and, girls, were forced, to, become, sex, slaves., Any who, resisted, were, brutally murdered., Anybody, with, half, a, heart, would've, thought, they'd, be, the, first, we'd, want, to,

previous, captives, and, their, Yazidi, sisters, who, have, picked, up, guns, and, are, taking, the, fight, back, to, ISIS., So, you, can, spend, 3-4, hours, tonight, listening, to, people, asking, you, to, stand, up, for, (insert, their victim, here), or, join, some, kind, of, Hollywood, "Star, Wars", concept, of, resistance...or..., you, can, take, 40, minutes, to, watch, real, victims, who,

show,, a, movie,, even, a, television, series., Every, now, and, then, one, comes, along, with, enough, talent, to, allow, you, to, build, a, world., Chris, Wiggins, was, of, the, latter, group., I, can't, remember, when, I, first, met, Chris., To, be, honest, he'd, been, a, fixture, on, Canadian, television, since, my, childhood,, starring, in, episodes, of, "Last, of, the, Mohicans",, "R.C.M.P",, "The, Unforeseen", and, just, about, every, other, CBC, drama,, including, "The, Best, Damn, Fiddler, from, Calabogie, to, Kaladar", which, won, him, a, Canadian, Film, Award, as, Best, Actor, in, 1969., His, voice, was, just, as, pervasive, in, commercials, and, a, raft, of, animated, series, like, "Captain, America",, "Spider-Man" and, "Rocket, Robin, Hood", as, well, as, more, than, 1200, radio, plays., Around, the, time, I, started, acting, professionally,, Chris, had, his, own, series,, "Paul, Bernard,, Psychiatrist",, a, remarkably, creative 5, day, a, week, 2, hander., The, first, show, we, worked, on, together, was, the, CBC, series, "The, National, Dream", though, we, didn't, have, any, scenes, together., He, was, Donald, Smith,, one, of, the, driving, forces, behind, the, construction, of, the, first, railway, to, link Canada, from, coast, to, coast,, while, I, was, some, Ontario, farm, boy, drafted, to, fight, in, the, Riel, Rebellion., But, at, one, point, in, the, story,, the, visuals, cut, from, Chris, to, me, and, I, felt, like, I'd, finally, "arrived", as, an, actor., We, worked, together, many, times, after, that,, often, in, animation., In, Nelvana's, first, animated, film,, "The, Devil, and, Daniel, Mouse", Chris, was, the, Devil, and, I, played, the, rodent., He, wasn't, the, kind, of, actor, who, talked, craft, a, lot, or, worried, directors, about, motivation, or, what, his, best, side, might, be., He, just, turned, up, on, time, and, did, the, job., One, of, those, classic journeyman, performers who'd, do, his, take,, then sit, nearby, reading, the, newspaper, or, doing, a, crossword, puzzle, until, the, next, set, up, was, ready., Then, he'd, step, in,, matching, exactly, the, energy,, focus, and, performance, as, if, no, time, at, all, had, passed., He, was, the, only, actor, director, Stefan, Scaini, and, I, even, considered, for, our, first, Christmas, collaboration, "The, Silent, Bell",, a, seasonal, charmer, that, won, a, bunch, of, awards, and, returned, every, Christmas, for, a, couple, of, decades, largely, on, the, basis, of, a, wonderful, performance, from, Chris., Where, I, got, to, know, he, and, his, talents, best, was, on, the, "Friday, the, 13th", series., Jack, played, Jack, Marshak,, an, expert, in, the, occult, whose, primary, practical, responsibility, was, to, explain, the, "mystic, shit", that, went, on, each, week,, so, our, series, leads, John, Lemay, and, Robey, could, go, about, fighting, the, weekly, mayhem., During, the, entire, run, of, the, show,, I, can't, recall, him, ever, asking, for, an, explanation, of, whatever, made-up, supernatural, powers, were, at, play., He, just, made, it, real., By, the, end, of, the, run,, he, was, an, integral, part, of, every, episode., And, if, any, of, the, above, gives, you, the, impression, Chris, Wiggins, was, some, kind, of Thespian drone,, you, couldn't, be, more, wrong., He, was, always, charming, and, fun, to, be, around,, laughing, and, sharing, anecdotes, about, the, famous, and, infamous, in, the, biz, whose, paths, he, had, crossed., One, of, my, favorites, was, about, receiving, a, call, from, a, cleaning, lady, while, he, and, his, beloved, wife, Sandra were, on, vacation., One, of, the, pipes, in, their, home, had, sprung, a, leak., Chris, told the, cleaning, woman, where, to, find, his, address, book, and, the, number, of, their, plumber., A, couple, of, weeks, later,, on, some, film, set,, he, was, approached, by, Christopher, Plummer, wondering, why, he'd, been, pestered, to, fix, the, pipes, at, Chris', place., Chris, Wiggins, passed, away, yesterday, in, a, small, town, care, home, far, from, the, bright, lights, of, show, business,, ending, a, long, struggle, with,

those, still, watching, it., But, the, reality, is, that, the, football, season, never, ends., And, it's, not, just, guys, like, me, trying, to, get, over, Super, Bowl, XLIX. , Teams, are, already, gearing, up, for, next, year., Stadiums, are, being, refurbished., Coaches, are, being, hired., Players, are, having, injuries, repaired,, being, released, from, contracts, or, negotiating, their, renewal. , And, in, High, Schools, across, America,, 17, and, 18, year, old, kids, are, deciding, what, college, will, best, prepare, them, for, a, career, in, the, NFL., Can, you, remember, what, career, decisions, you, were, making, when, you, were, 17, or, 18?, If, you, were, like, me,, you, were, pretty, much, consumed, with, buying, a, car, and, trying, to, get, laid., Yeah,, you, might, have, an, idea, of, what, you, might, want, to, do, (operative, words, "might")., But, were, you, capable, of, navigating, all, the, possible, scenarios, that, might, help, or, hinder, reaching, that, goal?, Thinking, back,, I, also, remember, some, of, the, real, stars, of, my, high, school., The, young, men, and, women, everybody, knew, had, a, special, talent, and, a, golden, future., We, had, the, best, basketball, player, in, the, city., A, couple, of, singers, as, good, as, anybody, on, the, radio., A, guy, so, smart, our, "Reach, For, The, Top", team, won, the, Provincial, championships., After, Grade, 12,, I, never, heard, about, a, single, one, of, them, again., We, all, make, decisions, that, seem, small, and, insignificant, in, the, moment,, not, realizing, until, decades, later, how, much, they, determined, the, ultimate, pattern, of, our, lives., That's, basically, the, theme, of, "Five, Star",, a, sports, doc, by, filmmakers, Ryan, Booth, and, Henry, Proegler, that, follows, a, decisive, few, days, in, the, life, of, a, 17, year, old, kid, in, Nacogdoches,, Texas,, pressured, to, make, a, decision, that, will, impact, everything, that, follows,

Scorsese, NYC, A, couple, of, weeks, ago,, Cameron, Bailey,, artistic, director, of, the, Toronto, International, Film, Festival,, published, what, pretty, much, amounted, to, an, open, letter, in, the, Globe, and, Mail, newspaper, entitled, "Dear, Canadian, Filmmakers:, It's, not, about, you., It's, about, us", basically, challenging, homegrown, cinema, artists, to, do, --, I, don't, know,, maybe, just, something, different., I, believe, I, speak, for, myself, and, many, others, either, making, or, trying, to, make, movies, here, when, I, say,, "This, gives, us, a, laugh"., In, his, effete, throwing, down, of, some, kind, of, gauntlet, of, self-interest,, Bailey,, like, many, in, the, business, of, supporting, and, promoting, the, Arts, in, Canada,, reveals, not, only, how, little, he, knows, about, how, the, films, he'd, prefer, to, see, get, made;, but, of, his, own, part, in, the, annual, regeneration, of, the, kind, of, movies, he, doesn't, much, want, to, see, anymore., For, it, is, Bailey's, own, TIFF, that, has, devolved, from, an, invigorating, film, festival, that, once, championed, up, and, coming, Canadian, talent, to, one, striving, to, be, seen, as, the, first, Studio, stop, for, American, Oscar, contenders;, while, the, majority, of, Canadian, filmmakers, are, relegated, to, being, second, or, third, class, citizens, in, their, own, country., Indeed,, it, is, film, programmers, such, as, Bailey, who, have, gotten, us, where, we, are, "creatively",, eternally, providing, a, pulpit, for, and, thereby, suggesting, up-and-comers, imitate, either, the, dense, vacuity, of, Atom, Egoyan,, the, cheap, patina, of, class, inherent, in, the, Robert, Lantos, imprimatur, or, the, eternally, ill, conceived, and, unrefined, first, drafts, or, first, edits, that, typify, Paul, Gross., If, Bailey, really, wanted, better, movies,, he'd, stop, programming, the, annual, failures, of, those, who, regularly, account, for, the, lion's, share, of, government, funding, (the, only, real, film, financing, in, this, part, of, the, world), and, get, his, movie, scouts, out, to, find, people, trying, to, do, something, better, --, or, at, least, more, interesting., Before, I, get, all, Greg, Klimkiw, on, everybody's, ass,, the, above, rant, was, inspired, by, a, short, film, on, Martin, Scorsese's, work, in, this, month's, Filmmaker, Magazine., Included, with, the, text, is, a, Leigh, Singer, video, essay, offering, a, staggering, insight, into, the, Scorsese, filmography,, the, city, where, half, of, his, films, are, set, and, how, both, combined, to, give, us, not, only, endlessly, original, and, re-watchable, movie, experiences, but, an, undeniably, clear, and, focused, body, of, work., It's, also, a, reminder, that, the, Scorsese, Oeuvre was, created, not, by, Pauline, Kael, or, the, programmers, of, the, New, York, Film, Festival, and, Museum, of, Modern, Art. , They, were, made, by, a, single, artist, given, the, freedom, to, follow, his, inspirations,, surround, himself, with, other, independent, artists, and, do, the, work, that, artists, do., Uninfluenced, by, those, given, to, navel, gazing, or, striving, to, one, day, collect, an, indexed, pension., Singer's, video, is, a, reminder, of, what's, possible, when, a, filmmaker, is, not, required, to, define, or, divine the, goals, of, bureaucrats,, but, work, his, own, magic., Enjoy, Your, Sunday., Posted, by, jimhenshaw, at, 10:47, AM, No, comments:, Email, ThisBlogThis!Share, to, TwitterShare, to, FacebookShare, to, Pinterest, Sunday,, January,

designed, as, an, aperitif,, but, pretty, much, combined, with, anything, liquid, if, you're, in, Italy., I, don't, know, what, put, me, off, Campari., Maybe, it's, because, it, can't, decide, if, it's, bitter, or, sweet., Maybe, because, the, color, originally, came, from, crushed, insects., Maybe, my, palate,, like, my, brain,, just, can't, handle, things, that, are, too, complicated., And, perhaps, I'm, not, alone., Because, Campari,, more, than, most, manufacturers, of, imbibable, spirits,, goes, all, out, when, it, comes, to, finding, creative, new, ways, to, promote, itself., For, decades, there, have, been, iconic, posters, and, calendars., Their, classy, magazine, ads, and, sophisticated, commercials,, populated, by, A, list, stars, and, fashion, models,, appear, with, regularity., They, even, have, a, youtube, channel, offering, famous, bartenders, inventing, new, ways, to, enjoy, their, product., And, now, they, have, entered, the, world, of, short, film, with, "Killer, in, Red", starring, Clive, Owen, and, directed, by, Paolo, ("The, Young, Pope"), Sorrentino., I'm, not, sure, if, it, will, change, anybody's, mind, about, trying, Campari., But, it, will,

president, has, said,, particularly, about, them,, you, have, to, wonder, if, the, times, to, come, will, be, more, interesting, to, the, Chinese,, or, us,, or, both., I, lived, in, LA, when, Ronald, Reagan, was, elected, President, and, most, of, the, showbiz, community, I, interacted, with, were, as, concerned, about, his, elevation, to, the, Oval, Office, as, today's, stars, and, celebrities., But, Reagan, had, been, governor, of, California,, as, well, as, a, one, time, movie, star,, so, a, chunk, of, the, industry, also, liked, him., One, day,, a, composer, I, was, working, with, shrugged, off, the, "sky, is, falling", predictions, of, some, of, the, more, progressive, musicians, we, were, working, with,, suggesting, that, in, his, experience, Conservative, governments, are, better, for, artists., And, in, the, decade, that, followed,, a, lot, of, us, worked, a, lot, more, than, we, had., Will, that, happen, again?, Who, knows. , The, only, thing, that's, become, crystal, clear, is, just, how, quickly, the, world, can, turn, on, a, dime., I, was, in, New, York, shortly, after, the, 9/11, attacks, and, overheard, two, high, school, kids, discussing, what, they, had, planned, for, the, weekend., One, of, them,, finding, his, buddy's, plans, fairly, lame,, responded, with, "Dude,, that's, so, September, 10th". , Times, change., We, all, have, to, adjust., Or, dig, in, our, heels, and, refuse, to, change, our, compass, heading., Something, that, doesn't, usually, work, out, well., It, might, be, worth, looking, back, at, who, we, were, on, November, 8th, and, decide, how, that, person, survives, and, prospers, over, the, next, four, --, or, maybe, even, eight, --, years., So, here's, filmmaker, Ryan, Scafuro's, both, objective, and, unflinching, take, on,

Lazy, Sunday, #, 453:, The, Blacklist, I've, long, believed, that, nobody, calling, themselves, an, artist, has, any, right, to, tell, another, artist, what, they, can, or, cannot, do, with, their, talents, let, alone, where, or, for, whom, they, can, perform., Recently,, there's, been, a, building, brouhaha, designed, to, convince, entertainers, of, all, stripes, to, either, refuse, the, booking, or, withdraw, from, performing, at, this, week's, Presidential, inauguration, in, Washington,, DC., Across, the, media,, both, traditional, and, social,, pretty, much, anybody, with, a, recognizable, name, in, film,, television, or, music, has, urged, their, peers, to, teach, President-Elect, Trump, some, kind, of, lesson, by, not, showing, up, for, the, gig., Now,, I'm, not, a, Trump, fan, --, and, isn't, it, interesting, that, I, have, to, issue, that, kind, of, disclaimer, --, because, otherwise, a, whole, bunch, of, people, would, either, just, stop, reading, this, or, get, busy, calling, me, a, racist,, a, misogynist, and, all, sorts, of, other, insults, of, the, day., But, where, do, any, of, you, get, off, dictating, the, terms, of, somebody, else's, employment?, None, of, those, people, or, what, they, have, to, say, bothers, me, much,, since, most, have, a, tighter, grasp, on, ideology, than, actual, talent., And, few, if, any, would, ever, get, an, invitation, to, perform, at, a, Presidential, Inauguration,, no, matter, who, was, taking, the, oath, of, office., Still,, they, go, after, everybody, from, the, Radio, City, Rockettes, to, marching, bands, from, Alabama,, artists, they'd, probably, never, personally, pay, to, see, --, shaming,, promising, career, disaster, and, uttering, death, threats., Seriously., Italian, opera, singer, Andrea, Bocelli, withdrew, this, week, because, he'd, been, getting, death, threats., What, kind, of, person, sends, death, threats, to, a, blind, man?, Just, how, deep, this, hatred, goes, was, illustrated, this, weekend, when, Nicole, Kidman, merely, refused, to, take, a, shot, at, Trump, and, said, she, was, adopting, a, wait-and-see, attitude., Director, Josh, Whedon, immediately, issued, the, following, tweet..., Good, thing, Mr., Whedon, has, gone, out, of, his, way, to, declare, himself, an, avowed, feminist., Otherwise,, God, knows, what, kind, of, venom, he, might've, spewed., All, of, this, has, reminded, me, of, a, rainy, night, in, the, mid-1990's,, when, I, ducked, into, a, Santa, Monica, bookstore, and, stumbled, into, a, reading, by, one, time, movie, director, and, the, only, Canadian, member, of, the, Hollywood, Ten, --, Edward, Dmytryk., At, some, point, in, Edward's, youth,, his, family, had, moved, from, BC, to, Los, Angeles, and, he, landed, a, job, as, a, messenger, at, Paramount, Studios., From, there, he, moved, to, film, editing, and, then, directing., Among, his, first, features, were, the, Film, Noir, classics, "Murder,, My, Sweet", and, "Crossfire", for, which, he, was, nominated, for, an, Academy, Award., He, would, go, on, to, direct, dozens, of, notable, films, including,, "Back, to, Bataan",, "The, Caine, Mutiny",, "Raintree, County",, "The, Young, Lions",, "Walk, on, the, Wild, Side",, "The, Carpetbaggers", and, "Mirage"., But, all, that, talent, and, the, millions, he'd, earned, for, the, studios, didn't, mean, much, when, the, House, Un-American, Activities, Committee, arrived, to, uproot, Communists, in, Hollywood, and, discovered, Edward, had, been, a, party, member, for, a, brief, time, in, 1945. , Like, others, of, "The, Hollywood, Ten",, Edward, refused, to, testify, before, the, committee, and, went, to, jail,, his, career, destroyed. , Later,, HUAAC, gave, him, a, chance, to, redeem, himself,, so, Edward, named, the, guys, he, was, already, in, the, slammer, with, and, they, let, him, go., While, lining, up, to, get, my, copy, of, his, book, autographed,, I, thumbed, the, pages,, finding, a, photograph, of, Edward, in, Convict, Blues, leaning, against, a, gas, pump, where, he, worked, gassing, up, the, the, prison, vehicles., During, his, reading,, he'd, referred, to, it, as, "The, best, job, I, ever, had". , I, asked, him, to, sign, that, photo, instead, of, the, title, page., He, laughed, and, we, started, a, conversation, that, would, go, on, for, several, weeks., Mostly, about, screenwriting,, editing, and, directing., But, also, --, what, happens, when, artists, are, turned, against, one, another, merely, to, suit, someone's, political, agenda., You, can, find, Edward, Dmytryk's, exceptional, work, almost, anywhere., But, here's, a, taste, of, what, Andrea, Bocelli, won't, be, doing, on, Inauguration, Day, but, Country, Star, Toby, Keith, will., Part, of, me, hopes, Toby, sings, one, of, my, personal, faves., It, might, be, quite, fitting., Posted, by, jimhenshaw, at, 9:24, PM, No, comments:, Email, ThisBlogThis!Share, to, TwitterShare, to, FacebookShare, to,
