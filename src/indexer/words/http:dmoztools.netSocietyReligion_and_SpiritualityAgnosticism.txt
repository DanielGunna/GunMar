term, originally, coined, by, Thomas, H., Huxley, in, the, 1840s, to, refer, to, an, ideology, which, states,, primarily,, that, the, nature, of, the, universe, and, of, existence, itself, cannot, be, known., Hence,, it, is, foolish, to, pretend, otherwise,, and, all, attempts, to, the, contrary, must, necessarily, end, in, dogma, lacking, in, all, form, of, proof., From, Huxley's, "Agnosticism":, "Agnosticism,, in, fact,, is, not, a, creed,, but, a, method,, the, essence, of, which, lies, in, the, rigorous, application, of, a, single, principle, ..., Positively, the, principle, may, be, expressed:, In, matters, of, the, intellect,, follow, your, reason, as, far, as, it, will, take, you,, without, regard, to, any, other, consideration., And, negatively:, In, matters, of, the, intellect,, do, not, pretend, that, conclusions, are, certain, which, are, not, demonstrated, or, demonstrable.", Subcategories, 3, Opposing, Views, 1, Personal, Pages, 0, Shopping, 0, Related,
