 Hi,, I’m, Tim, Rees., My, background, is, BBC, drama, and, before, that, the, military., You, can, read, about, my, life, in, the, army, in, my, memoir,, In, Sights:, The, Story, Of, A, Welsh, Guardsman,, published, by, The, History, Press, in, 2013., My, Memoir,, In, Sights, During, my, time, with, the, BBC, I, made, many, films, and, dramas,, including, one, about, a, period, of, my, life, titled,, Mimosa, Boys,, which, was, broadcast, on, BBC1, as, a, Play, For, Today., It, was, a, wonderful, period, where, I, worked, with, BAFTA, and, Emmy award, winning, directors., I, left, the, BBC, to, focus, on, writing, my, own, scripts, and ended, up, writing, the, novel, first, so, my, story, is, set, firmly, on, the, page, –, my, experience, with, the, BBC, taught, me, scripts, are, rewritten, and, change, from, the, original, script, due, to, budgets,, director’s, idea’s, and, perspectives, and, then, the, actors, come, in, with, their, own, ideas, on, the, character, they’re, playing., Making, a, film, is, an, intensely, creative, process, and, it, is, a, process, I, love,, but, after, finishing, my, first, novel,, which, is, Raw, Nerve,, I, knew, I’d, been, born, to, be, a, novelist, first, and, foremost,, mainly, because, the, creative, intensity, is, doubled, and, my, relationship, with, the, characters, is, so, much, more, real, than, working, on, a, script, where, it’s, necessary, to, leave, it, to, the, director, and, actors, to, flesh-out, character., After, I’d, finished, Raw, Nerve,, I, sent, it, to, an, agent, who, immediately, signed, me.,  Very, soon, after, that, I, was, flying, to, New, York, to, sign, a, deal, with, HarperCollins., Whilst, in, New, York, an, actor, friend, had, just, won, a, Tony, Award, on, Broadway,, so, we, hooked, up, and, in, his, dressing, room, I, met, a, film, producer, who, asked, what, my, novel, was, about?, I, thought, for, a, second, how, best, to, explain, the, story,, “It’s, a, fictitious, scenario, about, why, Colin, Powell, didn’t, run, for, the, White, House,”, I, said, casually., The, producer’s, knees, buckled., “I, have, to, read, it,”, she, gushed,, so, we, arranged, to, meet, up, the, next, day, with, my, agent., As, you, can, imagine,, this, was, very, exciting, times., Everyone, who, read, the, book, loved, it., So, why, didn’t, it, get, published, or, made, into, a, film,, you, may, well, ask?, Well,, although, all, the, junior, editors, in, the, major, publishing, houses, wanted, to, publish,, on, every, occasion, the, plug, was, pulled, by, the, President, or, Vice-President, of, the, company, because, it, was, considered, too, controversial., One, VP, actually, stated, they, couldn’t, be, associated, with, riots, in, the, streets, and, another, said, I, was, stretching, credulity, to, breaking, point, and, beyond, –, I, think, they, were, referring, to, the, fact, I, was, suggesting, a, black, woman, could, be, elected, to, the, White, House., It’s, laughable, now, since, Barack, Obama, has, been, elected, twice., Anyway,, I, kept, writing, and, had, a, short, story, commissioned, by, the, BBC., It, was, broadcast, as, part, of, an, arts, series, of, shorts, stories, with, a, twist., After, finding, myself, in, the, wilderness, for, a, few, years, –, I, was, actually, in, a, relationship, with, a, woman, who, had, children,, so, time, to, write, was, minimum, to, non-existent, –, I, was, pushed, and, prodded, by, a, new, girlfriend, to, write, my, memoir, –, she, loved, all, the, little, anecdotes, I, kept, recounting., Once, that, was, completed, I, very, quickly, got, another, agent, who, placed, the, book, with, The, History, Press., Since, my, experience, with, the, traditional, publishing, in, New, York,, the, publishing, industry, as, a, whole, had, changed, radically., Amazon, had, exploded, onto, the, scene, and, indie, authors, were, in, the, ascendency., It, seemed, everyone, was, writing, books, and, publishing, them, immediately, via, Amazon,, Smash, Words, and, a, host, of, other, self-publishing, platforms., In, 2012, I, did, try, self-publishing, Raw, Nerve,, but, I, was, very, unhappy, with, the, format,, so, unpublished, very, quickly., At, that, time, I, tried, to, read, a, couple, of, self-published, novels,, but, the, writing, was, awful, and, I, didn’t, get, past, the, first, chapter, with, either., So, I, forgot, about, self-publishing, and, focused, on, the, next, thriller, I’d, write,, which, turned, out, to, be, Delphian., Upon, completion, of, Delphian,, I, sent, it, to, my, agent, who,, even, though, he, loved, the, book,, told, me, it, was, far, too, long, for, a, debut, novelist, –, yes,, according, to, the, traditional, publishing, industry, I, was, considered, a, debut, novelist, rather, than, a, published, author,, because, memoirs, and, novels, are, very, different, animals…, After, some, research,, I, did, discover, my, agent, was, right., The, traditional, publishers, were, no, longer, taking, risks, on, novelists, without, a, track, record, in, sales., It’s, about, price, point;, the, target, is, two-hundred, and, fifty, pages, because, beyond, that, the, cost, of, printing, a, book, escalates., For, the, big, name, authors,, such, as, Stephen, King, and, John, Grisham,, they, are, happy, to, commit, to, a, very, large, print, run, to, get, the, price, point, right,, because, they, know, the, books, will, sell., But, to, print, a, novel, over, two-hundred, and, fifty, pages, for, an, unproven, novelist, the, publisher, has, to, take, a, risk, on, a, big, print, run,, and, publishers, no, longer, take, risks,, so, I’m, told., So, I, decided, to, self-publish, Delphian, and, set, about, writing, a, novel, within, the, two-hundred, and, fifty, page, bracket., The, result, was, WTF,, which, is, an, experimental, novel, for, me., Anyway,, the, story, came, in, at, two-hundred, and, twenty-seven,  pages., But, I’ve, self-published, that, novel, as, well., The, reason, for, this, is, I, had, experienced, success, with, Delphian, and, I, really, like, the, way, Amazon, pay, monthly, and, I, wanted, to, support, Amazon’s, innovative, Kindle, Select, or, Kindle, Unlimited, programme, where, readers,, for, a, subscription, fee,, can, download, as, many, books, as, they, like., The, author, gets, paid, according, to, the, number, of, pages, read., It, is, a, great, idea., I, also, tried, some, more, indie, author, novels, and, found, the, writing, standard, to, have, improved, 110%, from, my, earlier, experience., What, I, read, were, very, well, written,, great, stories., I, realised, indie, publishing, is, now, at, a, professional, standard, and, want, to, be, a, part, of, this, new, revolution., So, now, I’ve, recently, republished, Raw, Nerve, to, add, to, Delphian, and, WTF., Raw, Nerve, is, available, here:,  http://viewbook.at/RawNerve, Delphian, is, available, here: ,
