_______________________________________________________________________________________, Welcome, to, Qwipster's, Movie, Reviews., Those, of, you, who've, ever, looked, at, the, IMDB,, MRQE,, or,

get, you, to, see, it,, nor, will, I, give, it, the, lowest, unless, I, feel, it, truly, deserves, it.., My, main, objective, is, to, provide, thoughtful, commentary, about, movies, I, have, viewed,
