have, a, need, to, tell, you, about, Tonematrixes, I, need, you, to, know, that, visitors, to, the, SongTrellis, site, are, able, to, create, original, music, using, a, Tonematrix, web, page,, many, times, a, few, moments, after, they, have, seen, how, it, works., Two, tiny, testimonials, Testimony, #1, My, own, experience, using, the, SongTrellis, tonematrix, page, is, that, I, always, find, a, new, idea, that, I, want, to, keep, every, time, I, have, a, chance, to, use, it, for, a, few, minutes., This,, for, example,, was, a, three, minute, effort, created, this, afternoon, as, I, completed, this, page., And, once, I, find, a, new, idea,, I, know, that, I, can, vary, it, in, more, ways, than, I, can, keep, track, of., Visit, this, page,, go, to, the, bottom,, and, start, the, last, MIDI, controller, on, the, page., This, page, shows, submissions, from, last, to, earliest., You'll, see, and, hear, my, original, tonematrix, idea., Now, work, your, way, back, toward, the, top,, listening, to, each, track., These, are, all, variations, I, created, using, controls, on, the, Tonematrix, page., There's, one, matrix, image, that, changes, the, tonematrix, tempo, and, then, two, that, vary, the, instrumentation, for, the, animation., The, next, three, tracks, higher, on, the, page, were, made, by, changing, the, pitch, assignments, of, the, tonematrix, rows,, which, produces, entirely, different, melodies, which, maintain, the, shape, of, the, originals., The, last, two, were, created, by, shifting, the, original, tonematrix, pattern, down, and, then, up, in, their, grid,, All, of, these, variations, were, created, by, changing, a, control, setting, on, a, tonematrix, page,, and, then, pressing, a, button, to, generate, a, changed, performance., Usually, that's, a, 10, or, 15, second, process., Pretty, much, everyone, who's, browser, is, setup, to, play, MIDI, files,, will, be, able, to, play, this, Tonematrix, generated, music., If, you, click, on, any, of, the, grid, images, on, that, page,, the, tonematrix, loop, corresponding, to, that, gird, image, will, play,, provided, you, have, a, QuickTime, Version, 7, player, plugin, installed, on, your, system., This, link, will, explain, why, this, software, is, currently, necessary, to, run, a, tonematrix, animation., Testimony, #2, In, the, last, week,, I've, seen, a, 4, year, old, write, their, first, piece, of, music, after, being, shown, the, interface., Even, after, I, had, studied, music, for, years, as, an, adult,, I, never, had, an, expectation, that, I'd, be, able, to, easily, write, a, pleasing, small, piece, as, quickly, as, he, did., Now, that, I, use, tonematrixes,, that's, always, my, expectation., When, I, saw, him, the, next, day,, he, asked, "Can, I, play, that, game, with, red, and, green, squares, again"?, I, was, confused, at, first, because, I, wasn't, used, to, thinking, of, a, tonematrix, in, that, way., What, is, thees, thing,, what, you, call, it,, a, tonematrix?, A, Tonematrix, is, a, rectangular, grid,, a, kind, of, music, production, tool, displayed, on, a, webpage,, that, performs, a, piece, of, music, in, a, loop,, as, soon, as, one, of, the, tonematrix, grid, squares, is, turned, on, via, a, mouse, click., A, person, who, touches, a, Tonematrix, interface, for, the, first, time,, is, likely, to, experience, an, interesting, musical, result, as, soon, as, they, make, their, first, mouse, clicks, in, an, empty,, newly, created, Tonematrix., Once, they've, been, primed, with, a, small, number, of, hints,, it's, in, their, power, to, complete, a, musical, sounding, composition, a, few, moments, later., The, URL, that, launches, a, new, Tonematrix, is:, http://www.songtrellis.com/tonematrixAnimate, There's, a, "Tonematrix", link, that, appears, in, the, link, bar, at, the, top, of, most, pages, on, SongTrellis, that, will, launch, that., Here, are, the, hints:, 1), Choose, a, grid, square, in, the, Tonematrix, and, click, on, it., The, background, of, that, selected, square, will, change, to, be, colored, red, in, order, to, show, that, it, now, contributes, a, sound, to, the, Tonematrix, loop,, and, the, loop, will, begin, to, play., When, it's, time, for, your, chosen, grid, square, to, play, its, part, in, the, loop,, it's, color, will, change, to, green, for, as, long, as, it, sounds., If, you, click, on, a, colored, cell,, you, silence, it, and, its, color, changes, back, to, white, to, show, that, it, no, longer, contributes, to, the, loop., Here's, the, lay, of, the, land, in, a, tonematrix,, before, we, continue, with, hints, 2,, 3, and, 4:, Squares, that, are, in, upper, rows, of, the, grid, produce, a, high, sounding, pitch., Those, that, are, in, lower, rows, of, the, grid, will, produce, lower, sounding, pitches., As, you, move, lower, in, the, grid,, lower, pitches, sound., Grid, squares, on, the, same, row, will, play, the, same, preassigned, pitch., There's, an, exception, to, this, rule, that, will, let, you, reach, up, or, down, to, pitches, that, lay, between, the, row, pitch, assignments,, if, you, feel, the, need., Squares, in, columns, on, the, left, will, sound, before, squares, that, are, farther, to, the, right, in, the, grid., All, cells, in, the, same, column, start, and, stop, at, the, same, instants, and, play, for, the, duration, that's, been, preset, for, that, column., The, instant, that, column's, time, slice, is, exhausted, and, its, cells, stop, playing,, its, neighbor, to, the, right, starts, any, turned, on, any, turned, on, cells, it, has., As, soon, as, the, last, column, stops,, the, matrix, first, column, plays, to, restart, the, loop, Back, to, the, hints, 2), Now, choose, a, square, to, the, left, or, right, of, your, first, choice, in, a, different, row,, and, click, there., You'll, have, created, a, two, pitch, melody, that, continually, loops., If, you've, placed, your, two, pitches, in, non-adjacent, columns,, click, on, some, square, in, one, of, the, empty, columns, that, were, left, between, your, originally, selected, squares,, in, a, different, row, than, your, first, two, choices., If, the, squares, you, clicked, on, first, are, in, adjacent, columns,, click, on, another, square, before, or, after, those., 3), Listen, to, the, three, pitch, melody, you've, recorded, in, your, tonematrix,, if, you, don't, like, how, that, new, pitch, feels, in, combination, with, with, your, original, two, pitch, choices,, turn, that, square, off, by, toggling, it, off, with, a, mouse, click, and, click, on, a, square, in, a, different, row, of, the, column., It, may, be, that, you, enjoy, the, sensation, added, to, your, piece, by, your, last, mouse, click,, but, the, pitch, that, this, turns, on,, seems, like, it, is, sounding, either, too, early, or, too, late, in, your, loop, for, your, taste., In, that, case,, toggle, off, your, last, choice,, and, click, on, an, earlier, or, later, square, in, the, same, row., Remember:, all, squares, in, the, same, row, of, a, tonematrix, sound, the, same, pitch., 4), Turn, on, as, many, pitches, in, the, Tonematrix, grid, as, you, need, to,, until, you've, created, a, loop, that, you, enjoy, listening, to., If, you, have, questions,, ask, them, here, Posted, by, David, Luebbert,, 6/27/13, at, 9:16:22, PM. | Permalink | , Software, that, must,

number, of, jazz, musicians, as, NEA, Jazz, Masters., The, great, tenor, saxophonist, George, Coleman, has, reached, his, 76th, year,, and, has, still, not, been, accorded, this, honor., Remember, that, George, was, the, tenor, who, blew, sublimely, on, Herbie, Hancock's, Maiden, Voyage, album, with, Freddie, Hubbard, at, his, elbow, and, with, Herbie,, Ron, Carter, and, Tony, Williams, stretching, time, underneath, his, lines, in, wondrous, ways., And, remember, how, he, played, during, the, celebrated, NAACP, benefit, concert, of, February, 1964,, when, the, Miles, Davis, Quintet, (Coleman,, Hancock,, Carter, and, Williams, with, Miles), recorded, the, music, for, the, My, Funny, Valentine, and, "Four, And, More", albums,, an, incandescent, evening, in, the, history, of, jazz,

page, posting,, a, good, part, of, that, time, I, spent, developing, a, cool, music, composing, tool, for, SongTrellis, visitors, to, use, called, a, Tonematrix., What's, a, tonematrix?, A, Tonematrix, is, a, kind, of, music, creation, web, interface, that, plays, a, small, looped, musical, composition., It, displays, a, square, grid, on, a, web, page,, with, clickable, grid, squares,, whose, columns, represent, ticks, of, a, metronome, or, the, succession, of, durations, of, a, rhythm, pattern,, and, whose, rows, represent, one, pitch, out, of, a, harmonious, collection, of, pitches., Clicking, on, a, blank, tonematrix, grid, square, causes, that, row's, pitch, to, play, starting, at, that, column's, metronome, tick, within, the, tonematrix, loop's, tick, sequence., Permalink, How, do, you, play, with, a, tonematrix?, This, URL, will, display, a, newly, created,, pristine, but, silent, tonematrix,, waiting, for, your, first, composing, action:, http://www.songtrellis.com/tonematrixAnimate, You'll, launch, this, URL, whenever, you, follow, the, "Tonematrix", link, that, appears, now, in, the, middle, of, the, top, row, of, the, link, bar, at, the, top, of, pages, on, the, SongTrellis, site., You'll, hear, it, play, musical, sound, and, perhaps, see, it, animate, that, music, (provided, a, capable, animation-ready, web, browser, is, running), a, second, or, two, after, you, click, inside, any, grid, square, within, the, matrix, with, your, mouse., The, time, to, respond, to, a, click, action, at, any, instant, reflects, the, current, computing, workload, of, the, SongTrellis, web, servers., By, default,, each, matrix, column, corresponds, to, one, tick, of, a, metronome, that, clicks, at, a, fixed, tempo,, and, the, pitches, that, play, for, a, column, are, assigned, from, top, row, to, bottom, row, using, pitches, of, a, specified, chord, or, scale, that, are, replicated, over, several, descending, octaves., Permalink, How, does, a, tonematrix, work?, As, soon, as, a, user, clicks, on, a, blank, grid, square, in, a, matrix,, they, are, taking, an, action, that, adds, a, sound, to, the, music, loop, that, the, Tonematrix, software, plays., The, instant, a, user, clicks, on, a, square, in, an, empty, Tonematrix,, it's, color, changes, to, red,, the, pitch, corresponding, to, that, square's, row, at, the, instant, specified, by, its, column, is, added, to, the, matrix, loop,, and, the, Tonematrix, player, begins, to, loop, through, the, matrix, performing, it., Permalink, A, tonematrix, can, animate, a, musical, idea, in, an, instant, On, web, browsers, that, run, HTML5's, Canvas, animation, package, (Firefox,, Safari, and, Chrome),, a, tonematrix, will, animate, to, show, the, pitches, that, are, playing, at, any, instant, in, the, matrix, loop., If, animation, is, permitted,, as, soon, as, the, next, metronome, tick, occurs,, all, of, the, the, red, colored, squares, in, the, corresponding, matrix, column, turn, to, green, to, show, that, they, are, sounding, their, pitches., As, soon, as, the, next, click, takes, place,, all, of, the, green, colored, grid, squares, in, the, last, column, are, changed, back, to, red,, to, allow, the, next, column, begins, to, play, and, show, green., As, an, animation, takes, place, you, will, see, a, vertical, band, of, green, squares, that, will, loop, repeatedly, across, the, matrix, from, left, to, right., If, a, person, doesn't, like, how, a, particular, square, makes, their, piece, sound,, they, can, click, on, that, square, again, to, toggle, it, off,, thereby, silencing, the, pitch, that, this, square, added, to, the, tonematrix, performance., Permalink, What, makes, a, tonematrix, loveable?, I, love, this, most, about, a, Tonematrix:, using, one, it's, possible, to, show, a, person,, who, does, not, possess, even, one, word, of, prior, music, vocabulary,, how, to, compose,, depending, only, upon, the, tiniest, initial, instruction, and, their, own, innate, sense, of, musical, rightness., Here's, a, three, sentence, beginner's, instruction, to, get, someone, rolling, with, a, Tonematrix:, Click, on, a, grid, square., If, you, dislike, what, you, hear,, toggle, it, off, with, a, click, and, click, a, different, square, in, a, different, column,, until, you, hear, something, that, you, like., Click, on, squares, to, add, new, pitches, to, your, loop, until, you, feel, like, you, have, composed, a, complete, idea., Permalink, I, love, how, quickly, I, can, find, new, musical, ideas, when, I, use, a, tonematrix., When, a, person, clicks, within, a, grid, square,, the, SongTrellis, server, prepares, a, new,, changed, version, of, their, loop., When, that, new, version, of, the, piece, is, delivered, to, their, web, browser, a, second, or, so, after, their, click, action,, the, new, music, plays, and, the, animation, restarts,, to, let, them, hear, how, their, music, sounds, and, see, how, it, looks., If, they, discover, that, they've, made, an, unpleasant, change, to, their, piece,, they, turn, that, square, off, with, a, mouse, click, and, and, click, on, another, square, that, may, please, their, ears, more,, and, again, they'll, hear, the, audio, reflection, of, their, editing, action,, almost, instantly., Permalink, Shape, shift, an, idea, into, something, better, Because, the, tonematrix, is, looping, away, playing, the, current, version, of, the, music,, waiting, for, another, user, mouse, click, to, change, the, music, that's, playing,, it's, easy, for, a, tonematrix, user, to, quickly, decide, if, the, new, version, of, the, loop, satisfies., Frequently,, they'll, feel, that, they, had, gotten, the, pitch, of, the, next, sound, right,, but, that, it, might, sound, better, if, it, happened, at, a, later, or, earlier, tick, than, their, first, try., They, can, make, that, pitch, sound, earlier, by, clicking, a, square, to, the, left, of, their, original, choice, in, the, same, row., They, can, make, it, sound, later,, by, clicking, a, square, to, the, right, of, the, original., It, will, also, happen, that, they, might, like, the, contour, of, their, idea,, the, way, that, it, rises, an, falls,, but, feel, that, their, exact, pitch, choice, is, not, precisely, the, right, one, for, their, ear., It's, easy, to, toggle, off, the, less, effective, grid, square, and, listen, to, the, grid, square, neighbors, that, reside, in, the, rows, above, or, below, that, first, experiment., If, you, compose, at, a, piano, or, with, a, guitar,, you, must, precisely, remember, the, pitches, and, timings, of, the, idea, that, you've, just, stumbled, across,, so, that, you, can, write, them, down., That, skill, develops, while, exercise, it., A, tonematrix, though, is, a, musical, ratchet, tool, that, precisely, remembers, your, current, best, idea, as, you, grow, your, piece,, allowing, you, to, compose, even, when, your, musical, memory, is, still, under, development., Permalink, Intuition, gained, from, tonematrix, can, motivate, learning, the, musical, lingo, and, concepts, that, will, allow, one, to, compose, easier, and, with, better, control, (my, belief), Once, folks, have, acquired, some, intuition, about, how, musical, shapes, work, in, a, tonematrix,, I, believe, it, will, be, much, easier, for, them, to, learn, vocabulary, that, will, allow, them, to, develop, their, musical, ideas, ever, faster,, at, whatever, time, they, decide, that, such, learning, has, value, for, them., Remember, this, is, a, site, dedicated, to, providing, and, tools, and, musical, know-how, for, folks., Now, that, I've, introduced, the, tool,, I, intend, to, help, you, develop, your, know, how., Permalink, Perhaps, parallel, kinds, of, music, animations, can, help, There's, a, "Launch, Tunetext", button, in, the, interface,, which, will, launch, a, viewer, to, show, the, music, notation, translation, of, the, current, matrix, in, a, new, window., From, the, Tunetext, window, that, launches,, you, can, ask, the, SongTrellis, server, to, prepare, an, animation, that, draws, each, note, and, chord, on, an, initially, empty, music, staff, at, the, instant, each, of, those, objects, sound, in, the, score., This, kind, of, animation, cannot, be, instantly, produced, like, a, tonematrix, animation,, but, the, server, instantly, returns, the, URL, where, the, new, animation, will, be, delivered, one, or, two, or, a, few, minutes, later,, and, continuously, posts, a, status, report, at, that, URL, until, the, moment, the, animation, replaces, the, status, report, and, starts, to, play., A, tonematrix, composer,, who, doesn't, read, music, notation, yet,, can, look, at, a, notation, animation, and, quickly, appreciate, that, the, rising, and, falling, note, series, on, a, music, staff, shows, the, contour, of, a, musical, idea, in, the, same, way, that, the, up, and, down, transition, of, sounding, squares, in, a, tonematrix, animation, charts, a, melody's, contour., Permalink, When, a, tonematrix, is, used,, there's, enough, musical, safety, built, in, that, it's, hard, to, roll, into, an, instant, train, wreck,, which, nearly, always, happens, when, a, beginner, touches, a, new, instrument, or, music, production, tool., Because, the, matrix, pitches, are, assigned, using, a, particular, named, chord, or, scale, whose, pitches, harmonize, with, one, another,, it's, relatively, hard, to, find, pitch, successions, in, the, matrix, that, are, musically, senseless,, so, long, as, only, one, chord, is, dialed, in, for, the, matrix,, which, is, the, default, setup, for, a, newly, created, tonematrix., This, is, the, opposite, experience, that, beginning, musicians, have, when, they, try, press, a, succession, of, keys, on, a, piano, or, strum, strings, on, a, guitar, while, fretting, for, the, first, time., Unless, they, are, quite, lucky,, they, nearly, instantly, run, into, a, musical, train, wreck., Permalink, Your, webmaster, Dave, Luebbert's, Tonematrix, testimony, Testimonial, hat, on:, As, soon, as, I, started, to, use, this, interface,, I, began, to, easily, invent, musical, ideas, that, I, don't, believe, I, could, have, crafted, previously., Finding, chord, accompaniments, that, satisfied, me, for, the, melodies, I, invented,, became, especially, easy, to, do., Before, I, began, to, compose, with, a, tonematrix,, I, had, found, that, this, was, extremely, hard, work,, given, my, level, of, skill., I, started, to, find, new, ideas, with, varied, shapes, in, a, few, seconds, time, that, would, have, been, a, laborious, slog, to, discover, using, almost, any, of, the, other, music, invention, methods, I, know, how, to, invoke., I'm, thrilled, whenever, I, can, create, software, that, turns, nearly, impossible, to, accomplish, tasks, into, something, that's, easy, to, do, and, easy, to, teach,, so, working, to, better, the, capabilities, of, the, tonematrix, interface, has, been, a, thrill., Testimonial, hat, off., Permalink, An, amazing, thing, I, discovered, once, I, had, a, Tonematrix, available, to, play, with, Nearly, always,, once, you've, found, an, idea, in, a, matrix, that, sounds, good, for, a, chosen, pitch, set,, when, you, change, the, matrix, controls, to, use, a, different, chord, or, scale, for, its, pitch, assignments,, you'll, likely, find, that, the, matrix, still, plays, a, pleasing, idea,, albeit, with, a, different, emotional, complexion., With, this, capability, available,, you, can, vary, an, idea, in, hundreds, of, ways, and, quickly, find, a, variation, that, you, can, use, to, extend, your, composition, in, an, interesting, new, way., Once, I've, found, an, idea, that, I, like,, there's, likely, hundred's, of, different, sensations, and, emotions, that, can, be, expressed, by, applying, different, pitch, sets, to, that, base, idea, which, has, been, recorded, in, a, tonematrix., Permalink, The, Demos, Just, to, show, what's, possible,, here, are, some, example, Tonematrix, compositions, 1), a, loop, that, plays, an, idea, composed, in, less, than, a, minute, that, plays, through, a, D6, chord., This, loop, has, a, cheerful,, consonant, sound., 2), this, example, performs, the, last, tonematrix, through, a, different, chord,, a, Bb7Alt,, which, has, a, darker,, more, dissonant, feeling, to, it., To, create, this,, all, I, did, was, to, change, the, Chord, Root, and, Chord, Type, menus, in, the, controls, to, the, right, of, the, tonematrix,, and, press, the, "Change, Performance, Now", button., After, 15, seconds, of, effort, I, was, able, to, audition, this, new, music., 3), this, two, measure, tonematrix, is, used, to, perform, a, 4, measure, chord, progression., This, generates, music, that, performs, the, tonematrix, pattern, using, the, first, two, chords, of, the, progression, and, then, plays, a, different, but, similar, melody, by, interpreting, the, tonematrix, using, the, pitch, sets, of, the, last, two, chords, of, the, progression., This, music, took, about, 5, minutes, to, find., 4), this, shows, a, 4, measure, tonematrix, that, is, played, through, a, 12, measure, chord, progression., The, tonematrix, pitchset, is, stretched, to, fit, each, new, chord, at, the, instant, it, begins, to, sound, resulting, in, a, melody, that, accommodates, each, chord, change., Composing, this, was, a, ten, minute, effort,, with, most, of, the, time, devoted, to, choosing, the, chords, to, include, in, the, progression.,

the, simplest, building, blocks, A, lot, of, rhythmic, information, can, be, captured, by, writing, down, strings, of, symbols, consisting, of, the, numerals, 1, and, 0., In, this, description, scheme,, a, 1, is, an, instruction, to, make, a, sound, and, a, 0, is, an, instruction, to, remain, silent., If, we, can, assign, separate, one, syllable, word, translations, for, 1, and, 0, and, then, speak, those, translations, in, order,, we, can, speak, a, verbal, representation, of, a, rhythm., Since, we, are, trying, to, describe, hand, drum, patterns,, lets, agree, to, say, the, word, "hit', whenever, we, encounter, a, 1, in, a, rhythm, symbol, string, and, say, "don't", whenever, we, encounter, a, 0, in, a, rhythm, string,, So, if, we, saw, the, rhythm, description, 10010101,, we, could, verbally, translate, that, as, 'hit-don't-don't-hit-don't-hit-don't-hit", Similarly, when, we, saw, 011101, we, could, verbally, translate, that, as, "don't-hit-hit-hit-don't-hit"., Now, if, you, think, of, each, word, as, a, instruction, to, perform, a, particular, action, with, a, rhythm, instrument,, "hit", instructs, a, musician, to, strike, a, drum, with, your, hand, or, a, stick., "Don't', means, that, during, the, period, of, time, that, word, is, spoken,, no, action, should, be, taken, to, produce, sound, with, the, instrument,, leaving, a, gap,, which, musicians, call, a, rest,, in, the, sequence, of, rhythm, sounds, produced., We, can, make, these, lists, of, rhythm, symbols, arbitrarily, large., 0111010111011000101, would, have, the, verbal, translation, don't-hit-hit-hit-don't-hit-don't-hit-hit-hit-dont-hit-don't-don't-don't-hit-hit-don't-hit, Posted, by, David, Luebbert,, 3/24/11, at, 11:23:15, PM. | Permalink | , Thursday,, January, 6,, 2011,

of, this, form:, http://www.songtrellis.com/playRhythm?rhythm=, Following, the, rhythm=, in, the, URL,, the, Rhythm, Player, service, expects, to, find, a, rhythm, pattern, specification., The, playRhythm, service, expects, that, rhythms, will, be, described, using, a, small,, newly, coined, language, which, we'll, call, SongTrellis, Rhythm, Notation, The, simplest, rhythm, specification, The, simplest, rhythm, pattern, specification, is, a, string, of, an, arbitrary, number, of, 1, and, 0, characters, like, this, 01101101, or, 1011, or, this, 101, Such, symbol, strings, are, interpreted, a, symbol, at, a, time, from, left, to, right., Characters, of, a, specification, are, mapped, in, one, to, one, correspondence, to, a, series, of, evenly, measured, ticks, of, a, clock,, of, a, metronomic, click, track,, or, a, mentally, imagined, series, of, ticks., A, 1, is, an, instruction, to, the, reader, to, make, a, sound, in, synchrony, with, the, next, tick, of, the, tick, stream., A, 0, is, an, instruction, to, be, silent, for, the, following, tick., Musically,, a, 0, is, a, specification, of, a, rest., Any, number, of, 1, and, 0, characters, can, be, included, in, a, simple, pattern., The, pattern, is, by, default, considered, to, be, the, specification, of, a, loop,, a, pattern, of, hits, and, rests, that, repeats, indefinitely., By, default,, the, SongTrellis, website's, rhythm, player, service,, which, responds, to, playRhythm, URLs,, will, repeat, a, pattern, 4, times, when, it, is, performed., Adding, a, reps=, parameter, to, a, playRhythm, URL, controls, the, number, of, repetitions, that, will, be, performed, of, a, pattern., The, parameter, value, that, is, placed, following, the, equal, sign, is, always, an, integer, number, which, specifies, the, number, of, times, the, pattern, should, be, repeated., For, example,, the, URL, http://www.songtrellis.com/playRhythm?reps=8&rhythm=1001, will, repeat, the, four, tick, pattern, 1001, eight, times., By, default, a, rhythm, is, accompanied, by, a, click, track, when, it, plays., Setting, fClickTrack=0, in, the, URL, will, turn, off, the, click, track, accompaniment, The, URL, http://www.songtrellis.com/playRhythm?reps=6&rhythm=1001&fClickTrack=0, performs, pattern, 1001, 6, times, without, a, click, track, Punctuated, rhythm, specifications, By, punctuating, the, simplest, rhythm, specification, in, a, small, number, of, ways,, more, complex, rhythms, can, be, notated., In, all, but, the, simplest, rhythmic, situations, in, music,, the, hits, in, a, rhythm, (the, instants, that, a, sound, is, made), do, not, coincide, with, the, ticks, of, a, metronomic, clock., Instead, the, stream, of, measured, background, ticks, that, provides, the, rhythmic, framework, of, a, piece, of, music, are, used, to, mark, the, beat, within, a, piece, of, music., The, time, within, a, beat, is, subdivided, by, varying, counts,, and, musical, events, within, a, piece, all, begin, to, sound, at, an, instant, marked, by, a, particular, subdivision, of, one, of, the, beats, of, a, piece., Dash, characters, (the, '-', character), can, be, inserted, between, any, 1, and, 0, character, within, a, simple, specification, to, mark, the, boundaries, of, beats, within, a, rhythm, cycle., Adding, three, dashes, in, the, middle, of, a, simple, spec,, for, example,, breaks, the, 1, and, 0, sequences, of, the, simple, spec, into, four, groups., Those, groups, specify, a, sequence, of, 4, sub-patterns, that, will, sound, within, the, duration, of, a, 4, beat, cycle., Consider, the, rhythm, 1101011001110101, a, sixteen, beat, cycle., If, we, punctuate, that, spec, with, a, dash, character, every, four, ticks,, we, will, have, the, four, beat, pattern, 1101-0110-0111-0101, which, plays, the, idea, four, times, faster,, with, the, beat, sounding, at, the, beginning, of, the, pattern, and, every, four, subticks, after, that,, on, the, first, tick, of, each, subgroup., If, the, count, of, 1, and, 0s, in, the, simple, pattern, up, to, the, next, dash, character, or, the, end, of, the, entire, pattern, is, n,, that, beat, wii, be, subdivided, into, n, equal, parts,, and, sounds, will, be, performed, at, the, beginning, instant, of, those, subdivisions, within, the, beat., An, example, of, a, beat, delimited, pattern:, 01-1011-111, were, the, original, pattern, which, subdivides, the, second, beat, 4, times, the, pattern, 01-10[0101]1-111, would, play, the, subpattern, 0101, within, the, duration, of, the, third, subdivision, of, the, second, beat,, effectively, playing, that, pattern, using, a, clock, speed, of, 1/16, of, a, beat, duration, (a, duration, of, a, quarter, beat, divided, again, by, 4)., Bracketed, sub-patterns, of, a, beat, When, a, simplest, specification,, a, string, of, 1, and, 0, characters,, specifies, a, beat, (, is, delimited, by, dash, characters),, that, simple, specification, can, be, bracketed, without, changing, the, specifications, meaning., For, example, 01-[0101]-001", specifies, the, same, pattern, as, 01-0101-001, More, interestingly,, an, integer, number, can, be, written, immediately, after, a, dash, character, and, before, the, left, square, brace,, like, this:, 01-3[0101]-001, This, stretches, the, subpattern, 0101, to, play, over, the, three, beat, duration, of, beats, 2,, 3, and, 4, of, the, total, five, beat, duration, specified,, with, 01, played, during, beat, 1, and, 001, played, during, beat, 5., An, integer, prefix, written, in, front, of, a, bracketed, beat, spec, instructs, the, Play, Rhythm, interpreter, to, stretch, the, bracketed, pattern, over, a, duration, of, that, count, of, beats., This, has, the, effect, of, slowing, the, clock, down, by, that, integer, factor, until, the, bracketed, pattern, is, completely, performed,, at, which, the, original, clock, setting, is, reestablished., The, characters, 1, and, 0, are, reserved, in, rhythm, specifications, to, denote, subticks, of, rhythm, pattern., If, you, need, to, use, an, integer, scaling, factor, that, begins, with, the, digit, 1,, place, a, hat, character,, '^',, in, front, of, the, integer, count, 01-^10[0101]-001, specifies, a, 12, beat, pattern, that, stretches, the, subpattern, 0101, over, the, ten, beat, duration, of, beats, two, through, eleven, of, the, pattern., If, the, integer, used, begins, with, an, integer, between, 2, and, 9, inclusive,, the, hat, character, may, be, used, as, a, prefix, but, is, not, required, syntactically., Scaled, bracketed, patterns, inside, of, a, beat, specification, If, a, bracketed, sub-pattern, is, written, within, the, interior, of, a, beat, (ie., the, brackets, have, 1, or, 0, characters, listed, before, or, after),, that, sub-pattern, will, be, time, scaled, so, that, it, is, performed, over, the, duration, of, more, that, a, single, beat,, by, placing, an, integer, number, preceded, by, an, underscore, character, in, front, of, the, left, bracket., Example:, _3[11011]1-_2[1]_3[1], Here, the, first, beat, of, a, two, beat, pattern, is, subdivided, four, times,, with, the, 5, subtick, pattern, 11011, played, over, the, first, three, quarter, of, the, beat,, and, a, subtick, marking, the, beginning, of, the, last, quarter, of, the, beat., The, second, beat, is, subdivided, 5, times,, with, hits, occurring, at, the, beginning, of, the, beat, and, when, two-fifths, of, the, beat, have, elapsed., Any, valid, rhythm, pattern, can, be, bracketed, and, time, scaled, so, that, it, can, be, performed, with, the, duration, of, any, number, of, beats, or, any, number, of, subticks., Bracketed, patterns, can, be, nested, to, arbitrary, depth., Multi-voice, rhythm, ensembles, are, easy, to, notate, so, that, playRhythm, can, perform, them., Each, voice, specification, is, listed, in, sequence,, delimited, with, a, comma., When, a, comma, is, recognized, within, a, rhythm, pattern, specification,, the, playRhythm, interpreter, adds, a, new, voice, to, the, rhythm, score,, and, considers, the, specification, following, up, to, next, comma,, if, any,, or, to, the, end, of, the, entire, rhythm, specification, to, be, the, notation, of, a, new, rhythm, pattern, that, will, be, played, in, synchrony, with, any, previous, voices, that, have, been, added, to, the, rhythm, score, that, is, being, built., If, the, number, of, beats, and, subdivisions, of, each, beat, described, for, each, voice, of, the, ensemble, is, the, same,, the, box, notation, produced, by, the, playRhythm, for, each, voice, will, be, highly, regular,, making, it, much, easier, to, correlate, the, patterns, played, in, one, voice, with, those, in, other, voices., If, there, is, a, mismatch, between, the, count, of, beats, used, in, different, voices,, when, the, ensemble, pattern, is, repeated,, the, mismatching, patterns, will, float, with, respect, to, one, another,, so, that, different, parts, of, the, rhythms, will, be, performed, against, each, other, on, each, repetition, until, the, ensemble, has, been, repeated, enough, times, to, finally, establish, a, larger, repeated, rhythmic, cycle., Once, a, rhythm, is, found, that, sounds, good,, it's, easy, to, substitute, the, box, notation, symbol, for, a, particular, percussion, sound, for, 1, symbols, in, the, rhythm., The, star, symbol, '*', is, a, synonym, that, can, replace, 0, symbols, in, the, rhythm, specification., The, symbols, 'B',, 'O',, 'S',, 'H',, 'T',, 'Ss',, 'So', and, 'r', which, encode, types, of, percussion, sounds, in, Box, Notation, can, substitute, for, 1, symbols, in, a, specification., If, they, appear, in, the, rhythm, description,, they, are, displayed, in, the, corresponding, box, of, the, box, notation, that, is, produced., Default, instruments,, pitches,, and, volumes, volumes, are, assigned, to, these, symbols, and, determine, how, the, rhythm, is, orchestrated, for, performance., For, each, voice, specified, in, the, rhythm, notation,, a, corresponding, inst1=,, inst2=,, inst3=, etc, name/value, parameter, can, be, added, to, the, URL, to, override, the, default, bindings, for, the, different, percussion, instrument, sounds., If, the, symbols, 'B',, O', and, 'S', are, used, as, substitutes, for, a, 1, symbol, in, the, first, specified, voice, of, the, rhythm,, inst1=B:(inst:16385,vol:70,4,use:f),O:(inst:16385,vol:90,4,use:e),S:(inst:16385,vol:80,4,use:d), would, cause, the, B, symbol, to, be, performed, using, instrument, 16385, (the, standard, MIDI, default, drum, kit),, volume, setting, of, 80, (can, vary, from, 0, to, 127),, playing, a, D, pitch, from, the, drum, kit, in, the, 4th, octave, range,, 'O', using, an, E, pitch, from, the, fourth, octave, range, at, volume, 90, using, the, default, drum, kit,, 'S', using, a, D, pitch, from, octave, range, 4,, at, volume, 80, on, the, default, drum, kit., The, name/value, parameters, that, can, modify, a, playRhythm, URL:, The, only, required, parameter, of, a, playRhythm, URL, is, rhythm=, whose, parameter, value, follows, the, syntax, of, SongTrellis, Rhythm, Notation, bpm=, takes, an, integer, value, that, may, vary, from, 1, to, 999, and, sets, the, tempo, of, the, rhythm, performance, measured, in, beats-per-minute, units., The, interpreter's, default, tempo, is, 120, bpm., fClickTrack=, takes, 0, or, 1, as, parameter, values., A, 1, setting,, the, default,, means, the, beat, will, be, marked, using, a, click, track., A, 0, setting, means, that, the, click, track, will, be, suppressed, during, performance., reps=, takes, an, integer, value,, 1, or, greater,, which, determines, the, number, of, times, the, specified, rhythm, will, be, performed., The, default, reps, value, is, 4., pulse=, takes, a, fractional, parameter, with, integer, numerator, and, denominator, as, a, specification, of, the, beat, pulse, value, (eg., 1/2,, 1/4,, 1/8,, 1/2, would, be, valid, and, typical, pulse, settings), that, will, be, used, when, a, music, notation, score, translation, is, produced., The, default, pulse, setting, value, is, 1/4., Inst1=, inst2=, ., ., ., instN=, where, N, is, equal, to, the, count, of, the, number, of, rhythm, voices, specified, by, the, rhythm, parameter, notation., The, values, expected, are, documented, in, the, previous, section, of, this, document, and, define, the, instrumental, orchestration, that, will, be, used, to, interpret, specific, percussion, sound, symbols, that, may, substitute, for, 1, and, 0, symbols, within, a, rhythm, specification., Posted, by, David, Luebbert,, 1/6/11, at, 11:21:17, PM. | Permalink | , Advantages, of, using, the, SongTrellis, playRhythm, specification, language, to, notate, rhythms, Extremely, quick, feedback, to, hear, what, a, rhythm, idea, sounds, like, The, rhythm, submitted, is, translated, into, a, downloadable, MIDI, sequence, within, a, fraction, of, a, second, by, the, SongTrellis, playRhythm, service., Such, MIDI, sequences, will, be, performed, automatically, by, properly, configured, web, browsers, as, the, playRhythm, reply, page, loads., Music, score, and, box, notation, is, produced, and, viewable, in, the, web, page, that, performs, the, rhythm., In, the, same, instant, that, the, MIDI, performance, is, generated,, a, music, score, for, the, rhythm, is, rendered, as, a, downloadable, and, printable, JPG, format, image., Also,, if, the, rhythm, notation, is, in, a, simple, enough, format, (without, bracketed, patterns, that, subdivide, or, scale, a, tick),, the, rhythm, box, notation, that, hand, drummers, in, America, and, Europe, use, to, notate, a, rhythm, is, produced., The, procedure, to, interpret, box, notation, is, so, easily, taught,, experience, shows, that, musical, neophytes, can, quickly, be, taught, to, read, and, perform, rhythms, notated, in, this, manner., Rhythms, from, printed, musical, scores, and, those, expressed, in, box, notation, can, be, quickly, transcribed, into, playRhythm, notation, Extremely, easy, to, vary, an, idea, and, quickly, audition, the, variation, A, rest, tick, within, a, rhythm, can, be, changed, to, cause, a, sound, to, be, produced,, by, changing, a, 0, symbol, in, its, description, to, a, 1., A, hit, in, a, given, rhythm, can, be, silenced, by, changing, a, 1, symbol, in, its, description, to, a, 0., Adding, or, removing, a, 1, or, 0, symbol, from, a, rhythm, description,, changes, the, way, that, a, beat, or, sub-tick, subdivides, implicitly, and, immediately, varies, the, meaning, of, the, rhythm, to, the, listener., Inserting, a, bracketed, description, at, some, point, in, a, rhythm,, causes, a, burst, of, rhythmic, activity, to, take, place, at, that, instant, in, the, rhythm., Removing, a, bracketed, subexpression, simplifies, a, rhythm, and, reduces, the, perception, of, intensified, activity, at, that, point, in, the, rhythm., Moving, a, bracket, to, new, beats, or, new, tick, positions,, varies, the, sensation, produced, by, the, rhythm., Applying, a, scaling, factor, to, a, bracketed, sub-pattern, stretches, that, sub-pattern, over, a, specified, number, of, beats, or, sub-ticks,, which, makes, it, very, easy, to, produce, polyrhythmic, effects,, where, differently, subdivided, rhythm, cycles, play, against, one, another., Easy, to, produce,, vary, and, experience, polyrhythmic, ideas, Many, find, that, learning, to, hear, and, perform, music, that, uses, such, ideas, is, difficult., Since, a, playRhythm, interpreter, can, perform, such, ideas, immediately,, listeners, and, performers, can, improve, their, understanding, of, and, intuition, for, these, kinds, of, rhythm, ideas., Varying, the, scaling, factor, in, front, of, a, bracketed, sub-pattern, in, the, notation,, produces, and, varies, these, kinds, of, effects., Easy, to, produce, hand, drummer's, box, notation,, when, a, rhythm, is, expressed, using, the, simpler, forms, of, the, notation., Easy, to, resolve, nested,, bracketed, notation, into, simple, form, via, software., The, more, complex,, bracketed, notation, (possibly, nested), can, be, resolved, by, software, into, simpler, notation, that, is, box, notation, expressible,, at, the, cost, of, increasing, the, number, of, subdivisions, that, must, be, used, to, accurately, express, a, complicated, rhythm., The, bookkeeping, necessary, to, vary, a, rhythm, on, paper, using, music, notation, or, using, a, music, editor, is, expensive, in, time, and, mental, calculation, and, is, prone, to, error., If, a, performer, or, composer, wishes, to, experiment, with, rhythms, that, use, varied, subdivisions, of, beats, or, sub-beats, or, different, levels, of, subdivision, within, the, same, pattern,, they, have, to, mentally, do, a, large, amount, of, fractional, arithmetic, for, each, note, in, the, pattern, to, properly, represent, it, notationally., It's, extremely, easy, to, count, incorrectly,, so, that, the, rhythm, that, they, have, in, mind, is, misstated., This, can, easily, take, several, minutes, to, write, down,, even, with, software, assistance., Producing, more, instances, of, a, complicated, rhythm,, can, require, a, prodigious, feat, of, memory, to, reproduce, the, proper, sequence, of, durations,, or, more, frequently, requires, using, the, first, notation, of, the, idea, as, a, model,, which, can, be, difficult, to, follow, visually., Scaling, a, rhythm, to, stretch, or, shrink, an, idea's, total, duration, using, normal, music, notation, also, requires, lots, of, mental, calculation,, that, can, be, accomplished, in, the, playRhythm, notation, by, changing, an, integer, scaling, factor, to, a, new, value., Many, characteristics, of, a, rhythm, or, rhythm, ensemble, are, immediately, apparent, and, easily, extractable, by, examination, of, the, notation., It, becomes, easy, to, notice, the, similarity, and, differences, between, rhythm, patterns., Noticing, the, location, and, density, of, 1, or, 0's, immediately, gives, a, reader, some, idea, of, the, activity, and, complexity, of, a, rhythm., Once, one, becomes, aware, of, common, motifs, that, occur, in, specifications,, these, ideas, become, memorable,, a, kind, of, rhythm, alphabet,, which, suggests, related, or, contrasting, ideas, that, could, be, added, to, a, rhythm., When, such, notation, is, available,, it's, much, easier, to, mentally, picture, how, a, rhythm, goes, The, playRhythm, notation, expresses, an, idea, in, a, much, smaller, visual, space,, than, when, it, is, spread, across, an, inch, or, two, of, music, notation., It, becomes, possible, to, recognize, common, motifs, that, can, be, recognized, as, blocks, within, playRhythm, notation,, that, are, easier, to, memorize., A, rhythm's, notation, can, itself, be, used, to, name, and, index, a, rhythm, automatically., Many, more, rhythms, can, be, invented,, than, can, easily, be, named., It's, true, that, some, patterns, become, known, as, parts, of, well-known, ensemble, rhythms, or, as, the, basis, of, particular, performance, styles, and, acquire, independent, names,, but, its, laborious, work, to, coin, an, adequate, name, for, a, rhythm, that, is, newly, discovered., Listing, a, rhythm, as, a, sequence, of, durations, is, lengthy,, redundant,, tedious, to, read,, hard, to, mentally, interpret,, and, hard, to, memorize., Also,, such, an, expression, can, be, scaled, to, fit, different, duration, schemes, in, any, number, of, ways,, which, makes, it, difficult, to, canonically, identify, when, a, particular, rhythm, idea, has, been, invoked., The, playRhythm, notation, is, compact,, suitable, for, display, within, a, web, form, or, the, user, interface, of, music, editing, software., Characteristics, of, the, rhythm, can, be, noticed, by, easy, inspection, of, the, notation,, and, it, is, much, easier, to, recognize, motifs, within, such, notation,, which, aids, memorization, and, mental, or, computer, assisted, recall., A, particular, orchestration, of, a, rhythm, can, easily, be, translated, into, canonical, format, using, 1, and, 0, symbols,, so, that, different, ways, of, orchestrating, a, rhythm, don't, obscure, its, underlying, identity., Since, the, expression, of, a, rhythm, is, expressed, textually,, it, becomes, easy, to, search, via, search, engines, and, using, text, search, within, application, programs, When, music, is, only, represented, is, music, notation, or, as, a, musical, performance, it's, difficult,, quite, expensive,, and, frequently, impossible, for, software, to, reach, inside, those, representations, to, detect, features, within, a, piece., It's, extremely, valuable, to, have, a, parallel, expression, of, a, piece, in, the, text, domain, and, manipulable, using, the, extensive, text, search, and, transformation, software, facilities, that, are, available, via, the, web, and, on, personal, computers., Such, rhythm, specifications, can, easily, be, zipped, together, with, sequences, of, rules, that, specify, pitch, sequences, or, pre-listed, pitch, sequences, via, software, to, produce, new, melodies, This, kind, of, capability, to, zip, pitch, sequences, with, a, collection, of, rhythmic, ideas, increases, the, number, of, ideas, a, composer, or, performer, can, audition, per, unit, time, as, they, invent, new, musical, compositions,, increasing, the, flow, of, ideas, that, they, consider, for, inclusion, in, their, piece., Posted, by, David, Luebbert,, 1/6/11, at,

that, any, visitor, to, SongTrellis, can, use, to, generate, an, animation, that, shows, precisely, how, a, musical, score, they, specify, should, be, interpreted, at, any, tempo., If, you, don't, know, how, to, read, music,, these, animations, will, precisely, demonstrate, for, you, how, a, score, is, performed,, show, how, music, notation, is, translated, into, audible, musical, sound., The, process, of, rendering, the, animation, as, a, QuickTime, movie, for, small, scores, usually, completes, in, less, than, 20, seconds., Frequently, it, completes, before, 5, seconds, have, elapsed., Rendering, large, scores, can, take, a, minute, or, two., Since, the, animation, rendering, process, does, not, complete, instantaneously,, animation, requests, can, stack, up, during, busy, periods,, so, requests, are, queued, and, a, progress, report, is, returned, so, that, users, can, anticipate, when, their, animation, will, be, ready, to, watch., I, believe, that, early, users, of, the, service, will, find, that, animations, render, quite, quickly., Initially,, you'll, be, able, to, use, this, facility, even, if, you, are, not, signed, in, a, member, of, the, SongTrellis, site,, in, the, interest, of, getting, folks, to, kick, the, tires, on, this, new, feature, of, the, site., What, does, a, score, animation, look, like?, When, a, score, animation, begins, to, play,, a, blank, music, staff, is, displayed, onscreen, in, the, animation, video's, display, area, as, its, soundtrack, starts, to, sound., At, the, instant, each, new, note, or, chord, sounds, in, the, score, or, when, a, rest, initiates, a, period, of, silence, in, a, score, voice,, those, score, elements, are, added, to, the, staff,, showing, a, visual, equivalent, of, each, musical, sensation, that, you, hear, in, the, performance., As, a, piece, plays,, you, see, a, traveling, wave, of, notation, that, grows, to, the, right., When, staff, real, estate, is, exhausted, on, the, bottom, right, of, the, score, image, ,, the, page, is, turned,, and, a, blank, staff, is, drawn, for, the, next, measures, of, the, composition, to, play, onto., The, animation, continues, in, this, manner, until, the,

on, this?, I, originally, implemented, this, animation, facility, in, my, music, editor, thinking, that, viewing, scores, properly, animated, would, help, me, in, my, musical, studies, and, would, give, me, better, feedback, and, help, develop, better, intuition, as, I, composed, new, music., Animated, scores, have, proved, to, extremely, useful, to, me, in, my, own, musical, development,, so, I, want, to, see, if, they, make, a, difference, for, visitors, to, the, SongTrellis, site, when, I, deliver, them, via, a, commonly, used, video, format., Besides, that,, I, have, some, pride, that, perhaps, I've, created, something, before, anyone, else, in, the, world, has, thought, to, do, it., So, far, as, I, can, tell,, no, one, has, tried, to, provide, such, a, service, on, the, Internet,

Department, SongTrellis, now, has, a, Public, Ideas, department., If, you, follow, the, link,, you'll, see, a, list, of, the, days, on, which, new, ideas, have, been, submitted., If, you, click, on,

the, SongTrellis, site, I'm, upgrading, the, MacMini, that, handles, music, editing, requests, on, SongTrellis., If, you, use, the, Excerpt, Service,, the, Chord, Grid,, Tunetext,, or, any, of, the, Workscore, editing, pages, (Workscore, Composer,, Workscore, Chord, Entry,, or, Chord, Entry, By, Grid),, all, of, those, functions, now, execute, on, that, Mac, Mini., As, a, result,, you, should, notice, that, just, about, any, operation, you, execute, on, those, pages, will, respond, a, quarter, second, to, a, half, second, faster., If, I've, done, my, job, right,, that's, really, all, you, should, notice, about, this, change., If, you, find, any, feature, of, the, site, that's, not, working, the, way, you, expect,, let, me, know,, and, I'll, see, if, it's, happening, because, of, the, changes, I've, made, to, the, server, setup., I, should, be, able, to, fix, such, problems, pronto., I'm, also, right, on, the, verge, (tomorrow,, if, all, goes, well), of, making, a, big, change, to, the, way, SongTrellis, is, hosted., Ever, since, I, opened, the, site,, the, site's, server, software, has, run, on, Dell, Power, Edge, servers, that, run, a, Microsoft, Small, Business, operating, system., That, new, MacMini, is, powerful, enough, to, do, everything, the, Dell, servers, did,, and, will, be, much, less, of, a, hassle, to, maintain, and, less, costly, to, run., Unless, I, hear, of, terrible, problems,, tomorrow, I'll, make, the, change, that, will, cause, SongTrellis, to, be, entirely, hosted, on, the, new, MacMini., This, means, that, I'll, change, the, site's, configuration, so, that, when, a, user, asks, to, see, a, page, on, songtrellis.com,, that, request, will, be, directed, to, IP, address, 216.168.47.12,, the, address, of, the, Mac, Mini,, rather, than, 216.168.60.220,, the, IP, address, of, the, Dell, server., This, configuration, change, will, be, noticed, by, all, of, the, name, server, computers, in, the, world, over, a, 24, hour, period., When, the, name, server, that, provides, your, web, browser, with, the, IP, address, for, songtrelis.com, finally, notices, this, change,, your, web, requests, will, begin, to, be, handled, by, the, new, MacMini, server., Earlier, this, afternoon,, I, copied, every, member, Workscore, from, the, Dell, server, to, the, Mac, Mini., Around, 4pm, PST,, I, changed, all, of, the, music, editing, links, on, the, SongTrellis, linkbar, to, use, URL's, that, run, on, the, MacMini, server., If, for, example,, you, followed, the, "Workscore, Composer", link,, you, would, find, that, it, now, loads, a, URL, that, reads, as, http://216.168.47.12/workscoreComposer2, rather, than, http://www.songtrellis.com/workscoreComposer2., That, way, when, I, change, the, name, service, record, for, the, site,, there, will, be, no, possibility, that, you'll, make, edits, to, your, workscore, that, will, be, forgotten, when, all, processing, shifts, over, to, the, MacMini., 24, hours, after, I, make, the, name, service, change,, I'll, change, the, music, editing, URLs, on, the, site, again, so, that, they, all, point, to, www.songtrellis.com., This, whole, website, migration, process, should, be, complete, sometime, late, on, Saturday., If, you, run, across, any, problems,, let, me, know, via, email, at, davidlu, at, songtrellis.com., You, can, also, call, me, via, Skype., My, Skype, ID, is,
