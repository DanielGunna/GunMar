and, organize, the, web, May, 21,, 2013, by, Jo, (3, Comments), Share, this:, Pin, It, Do, you, sometimes, wonder, how, people, were, doing, research, in, the, pre-internet, age?, I, do, this, quite, often,, and, do, you, know, what, I, am, thinking, right, after?, How, the, hell, did, I, do, research, on, the, web, before, I, knew, about, Diigo?!!, Diigo, is, one, of, my, core, information, management, tools., Some, people, call, it, a, social, bookmarking, service,, but, it, is, far, more, than, that., With, Diigo,, you, can:, Highlight, text, on, webpages, in, up, to, four, colours, Add, comments, to, your, highlights, Add, floating, sticky, notes, to, record, your, own, thoughts, Save, bookmarks, and, organize, them, via, tags, in, your, Diigo, database, Save, webpages, into, Diigo's, Read, Later, list, Add, a, description, to, remind, you, why, you, saved, this, particular, bookmark, Save, the, entire, webpage, into, your, Diigo, database, via, its, Cache, function, Share, your, annotations, and, bookmarks, with, the, world,, or, with, colleagues, via, lists, and, groups., In, short,, Diigo, is, an, amazing, tool, for, knowledge, workers, to, annotate,, archive, and, organize, the, web, –, either, for, yourself, or, in, collaboration, with, others., And, as, an, educator,, you, even, get, a, free, upgrade, to, a, Diigo, Education, account, with, unlimited, highlighting., Cha-ching!!, If, this, sounds, like, a, lot, of, features, for, no, money,, you, are, absolutely, right., In, this, post,, I, am, telling, you, what, I, use, Diigo, for, and, what, setup, (browser,, apps), work, best, for, me., So, if, you, haven't, heart, about, Diigo, before,, this, post, is, absolutely, for, you., And, if, you, are, already, a, Diigo, fan, like, me,, keep, reading:, I, am, sharing, some, cool, tweaks, in, the, settings, menu, that, make, Diigo, even, more, awesome.,  , What, I, am, using, Diigo, for, Diigo, is, an, incredible, versatile, tool, and, will, help, you, with, most, of, your, needs., For, some,, this, might, include, sharing, their, bookmarks, and, annotations,, or, exploring, what, other, people, are, saving, into, their, Diigo, library., However,, I, am, not, really, using, Diigo, for, discovery, and, sharing., Maybe, I, should,, but, I, believe, that, services, that, are, linked, in, with, twitter,, facebook, and, pinterest, are, much, more, suited, for, this., Simply, because, they, are, more, widely, used., However,, your, milage, might, vary,, especially, if, you, invest, some, time, into, building, your, social, network, with, other, people, on, Diigo, (see, my, upcoming, post, on, Diigo, for, power, users, –, coming, soon)., I, am, using, Diigo, foremost, in, "private", mode:, as, my, own, personal, internet, library., Call, me, anti-social, if, you, like,, but, I, am, not, a, big, fan, of, people, knowing, what, I, am, highlighting,, Since, these, are, often, related, early, research, interests, of, mine,, I, want, to, rather, keep, my, highlights, under, the, covers., Diigo, lets, me, keep, my, stuff, private,, which, is, great., So, what, can, you, use, Diigo, for?,  , Use, Example, 1:, Building, your, Knowledge, Database, Whenever, I, am, reading, an, article, that, I, think, might, be, helpful, sometimes, later,, it, goes, straight, into, my, Diigo, database., It, might, be, about, a, phenomenon, that, I, am, interested, in, exploring, with, future, research,, or, something, I, want, to, write, about, on, academiPad, some, day., I, quickly, highlight, passages, that, are, most, relevant,, which, automatically, adds, this, page, to, my, database., In, addition,, I, assign, some, tags, so, that, I, can, easily, find, this, page, when, I, am, coming, back, to, the, topic., Diigo, will, recommend, some, tags, based, on, the, content, of, the, webpage,, and, it, also, remembers, what, tags, you, used, last, time, when, saving, a, bookmark., But, it, gets, more, awesome:, In, Chrome,, Diigo, also, suggests, previously, used, tags, when, you, start, typing., That's, pretty, cool,, and, a, good, reason, why, to, use, Chrome, as, your, primary, browser., I, will, discuss, some, more, differences, between, Diigo, in, Chrome, and, Firefox, further, down.,  , Use, Example, 2:, Read, it, later, One, thing, I, am, trying, to, push, myself, to, is, to, do, one, task, at, a, time., I, call, this, mono-tasking., As, a, grad, student,, nobody, except, myself, monitors, my, time, or, what, I, am, doing, with, it., And, in, order, to, not, fall, into, the, rabbit, hole, of, reading, one, story, after, another,, I, save, articles, I, am, coming, across, during, the, day, in, Diigo's, Read, Later, folder., There, is, a, custom, bookmark, that, lets, me, do, this, nice, and, easy,, or, you, can, use, the, menu, in, the, Chrome, extension, /, Firefox, toolbar., As, a, third, alternative,, you, can, add, pages, to, your, Read, Later, list, via, the, context, menu., At, the, end, of, the, day,, or, whenever, I, have, time, to, catch, up,, I, can, visit, my, Read, Later, list, either, from, the, Mac, or, on, my, iPad, via, the, free, Diigo, Browser., Check, further, down, for, some, extra, tips, on, how, to, make, adding, and, accessing, stuff, in, your, Reading, List, even, easier.,  , Use, Example, 3:, Primary, research, with, Diigo, Because, Diigo, can, cache, webpages,, it, is, also, a, great, tool, to, do, primary, research., Caching, a, webpage, basically, means, that, you, save, its, current, state, to, the, database., So, even, if, the, webpage, changes, or, goes, offline, some, day,, you, will, still, have, the, exact, same, webpage, to, work, with, as, when, you, saved, it., Obviously,, this, is, really, important, when, webpages, are, a, primary, data, source, for, your, research,, for, example, when, you, are, conducting, a, content, analysis, on, a, discussion, board, or, a, visual, analysis, of, a, corporate, webpage., Highlighting, and, assigning, tags, to, cached, webpages, are, great, tools, to, analyze, this, data, for, your, research., However,, if, you, are, planning, to, use, Diigo, for, primary, research,, you, will, probably, need, the, Premium, Plan, ($5/month, or, $40/year), to, unlock, unlimited, page, caching, and, screen, captures., Are, you, liking, Diigo, so, far?, Please, retweet, and, read, on,, there, is, more, to, come, (look,, it, rhymes!):, https://twitter.com/academiPad/status/336837871883395072,  , Setting, up, Diigo, for, optimal, performance, In, this, section, I, describe, what, different, tools, I, am, using, with, Diigo, on, both, Mac, and, iPad., The, short, version, is:, Use, Chrome, on, the, Mac, to, leverage, the, power, of, extensions,, and, use, the, free, Diigo, Browser, on, your, iPad, to, take, your, Read, Later, list, to, bed.,  , On, the, Mac:, Chrome, vs., Firefox, I, was, on, the, fence, what, browser, I, should, use, for, quite, some, time., While, Safari, isn't, the, best, browser, anyways,, its, almost, complete, lack, of, Diigo, tools, broke, the, straw, for, me;, nowadays, you, will, hardly, find, me, on, Safari., Both, Firefox, and, Chrome, have, decent, support, for, Diigo., Spoiler, alert:, I, find, the, integration, with, Chrome, slicker, and, more, comprehensive, (Google, search, support),, and, this, is, why, I, adopted, Chrome, as, my, primary, browser., Let's, look, into, the, differences, in, a, little, bit, more, detail,, because, there, are, a, couple, of, settings, that, can, make, your, Diigo, experience, even, more, awesome., Firefox, has, an, advantage, in, that, the, Diigo, add-on, installs, a, toolbar, that, gives, you, instant, access, to, all, Diigo, features., So, if, you, prefer, to, have, all, options, clearly, laid, out,, Firefox, is, a, better, browser, for, you, –, at, least, when, it, comes, to, Diigo., Chrome,, on, the, other, hand,, operates, via, an, extension, button, and, a, somewhat, less, cluttered, (but, also, less, comprehensive), floating, menu, for, annotating, webpages., It, still, offers, most, functions,, and, in, my, opinion, Diigo, looks, a, little, bit, more, polished, on, Chrome., In, practice,, however,, you, don't, really, have, to, worry, about, all, of, this,, because, both, browsers, let, you, easily, highlight, text, by, simply, selecting, it, with, your, mouse, and, then, choosing, the, "Highlight", text/symbol., This, is, how, it, looks, like, in, Chrome:,  , Follow, academiPad, on, pinterest, to, see, our, freshest, pins, on, how, to, study, in, style,, and, don't, forget, to, pin, this, post, to, your, own, board, as, well., Optimize, the, settings, to, make, Diigo, even, more, awesome, For, things, like, easy, highlighting, and, tagging,, you, have, to, tweak, the, settings, a, little., In, Firefox,, this, looks, like, this:, On, the, right, side, of, the, picture, above, (click, to, enlarge),, the, "private", as, default, checkbox, is, an, important, one, you, might, want, to, enable,, depending, on, your, own, taste, of, how, much, transparency, is, too, much., Another, great, feature, to, enable, in, the, "Toolbar, and, Menus", tab, (left, side), is, the, second, checkbox,, "Show, drop-down, menu, when, text, is, selected"., I, highly, recommend, to, enable, this,, because, it, makes, annotating, so, much, faster., In, Chrome,, the, settings, look, like, this:, The, first, checkbox, in, the, "Bookmarking", box, and, the, second, checkbox, in, the, "Enable, annotations…", box, do, the, same, as, in, the, Firefox, version, shown, above., Also,, note, that, the, very, handy, "Keyboard, Shortcuts", are, also, available, in, Firefox;, you, will, find, them, in, the, "Miscellaneous", tab., There, are, a, couple, of, features, though, in, the, Diigo, for, Chrome, settings, that, you, won't, find, in, Firefox,, and, this, is, the, reason, that, Chrome, became, my, browser, of, choice., You, heart, right:, Google's, Chrome,, not, Apple's, Safari,, is, my, default, browser,, and, I, don't, even, use, Gmail!, All, because, of, Diigo,, this, is, how, much, I, am, a, fan, of, this, web, annotation, service.,  , Read, Later:, This, is, where, Google, Chrome, really, shines, There, are, two, Diigo, features, in, Chrome, that, sealed, the, deal, for, me:, First,, you, can, set, Diigo, to, automatically, close, a, tab, or, window, that, you, have, sent, to, your, Read, Later, list., This, only, works, when, using, the, right, click, context, menu, or, the, extension, button,, not, with, the, Read, Later, Bookmark, that, you, can, place, in, your, Bookmark, Bar., Unfortunately,, Chrome, groups, context, menu, commands, for, the, same, extension, in, a, folder,, so, the, Read, Later, command, is, a, little, bit, tucked, away, in, the, context, menu., I, know, this, counts, as, a, first, world, problem,, but, if, you, want, a, slightly, easier, way, to, add, pages, to, your, Read, Later, list,, another, Diigo-enabled, Chrome, extension, called, Read, Later, Fast, is, ideal, for, you., It, adds, its, own,, more, accessible, context, menu, command,, and, you, can, also, set, a, keyboard, shortcut, for, sending, tabs, to, your, Read, Later, list., So, how, fantastic, is, this?, All, I, have, to, do, is, to, hit, "Control, +, Shift, +, L", (customizable),, and, PUFF!, –, the, tab, I, was, just, on, is, closed, and, safely, tucked, away, in, my, reading, list., Read, Later, Fast, also, has, its, own, reading, interface, in, Chrome,, which, is, more, lightweight, than, Diigo, but, obviously, lacks, Diigo's, tacking, functionality., However,, I, go, through, my, Read, Later, list, most, of, the, time, on, the, iPad, –, see, below.,  , Get, quick, access, to, your, Diigo, database, when, googeling, on, Chrome, The, second,, more, important, reasons, why, Chrome, is, the, best, browser, when, it, comes, to, Diigo, is, because, you, can, integrate, your, Diigo, library, with, all, your, Google, searches., I, highly, recommend, to, keep, the, two, checkboxes, in, the, "Search", box, of, the, settings, enabled., Whenever, you, search, something, in, Google,, you, will, be, notified, if, anything, that, matches, your, search, query, already, exists, in, your, Diigo, library., There, is, a, little, delay, that, sometimes, irritates, me, (because, I, am, already, clicking, on, the, first, line, and, then, the, window, changes, and, I, click, on, Diigo, instead),, but, having, such, a, convenient, way, to, know, that, you, already, have, something, similar, in, your, library, is, well, worth, it., So, go, on,, install, the, Diigo, extension, on, your, (now), favourite, Google, Chrome, browser,, and, make, the, web, your, own.,  , On, the, iPad, The, iPad, is, a, little, bit, Diigo's, Achilles, heal., Why, I, am, a, huge, fan, of, Diigo's, web, services,, the, folks, over, at, Diigo, are, excruciating, slow, when, it, comes, to, rolling, out, decent, companion, apps, for, iPad, and, iPhone., Your, best, choice, is, to, totally, ignore, the, Diigo, for, iPad, and, Diigo, for, iPhone, apps, for, now., But, that, doesn't, mean, that, Diigo, has, nothing, to, offer, for, you, iPad, user:, First,, you, can, install, Diigo's, Web, Highlighter, for, iPad, Safari, to, get, the, exact, same, web, annotation, and, organizing, functionality, onto, your, portable, device., What, it, does, is, adding, a, little, bookmark, into, Safari, on, iPad, (or, another, browser, on, the, iPad)., Tapping, on, this, bookmark, will, bring, up, what, is, called, the, "Diigolet":, a, small, tool, for, highlighting, and, tagging, webpages, not, unlike, what, you, are, getting, in, Chrome.,  , I, totally, recommend, doing, that., It, requires, a, few, steps,, but, the, linked, webpage, above, does, a, good, job, explaining, what, to, do., And, it, is, always, good, to, have, the, option, to, quickly, tag, some, webpage, while, browsing, on, iPad's, Safari., One, problem, with, this, Safari-addition, is, that, you, won’t, see, any, annotations, on, a, previously, bookmarked, page, until, you, display, the, Diigolet., And, once, you, jump, to, the, next, page,, the, Diigolet, is, gone, and, you, have, to, display, it, again, in, order, to, keep, highlighting., For, me,, this, is, way, too, effortful., It’s, still, good, to, have, the, Diigolet, installed, to, have, it, ready, when, you, need, it,, but, in, my, opinion,, using, the, Diigo, Browser, as, your, default, browser, is, the, by, far, better, option.,  , Diigo, Browser, might, very, well, be, your, only, browser, on, iPad, Second,, you, have, to, check, out, Diigo's, other, free, app:, Diigo, Browser, (iTunes, link)., It, might, take, you, a, little, while, to, get, used, to, this, browser,, but, after, a, while, you, will, find, that, it, is, an, amazing, app., Heck,, it, might, very, well, replace, Safari, on, my, iPad, altogether., As, you, would, expect,, Diigo, Browser, tightly, integrates, with, Diigo, and, lets, you, easily, highlight, and, annotate, webpages., Like, in, iBooks,, Papers, or, Sente,, simply, select, text, and, choose, "Highlight", or, "Note", to, annotate, this, passage., I, haven't, found, a, way, to, change, the, highlighting, colour, or, to, add, sticky, notes, that, float, around, on, the, webpage., It, would, be, nice, if, this, functionality, was, added, some, time,, but, its, not, a, deal, breaker,, especially, since, Diigo, Browser, is, free, anyways.,  , And, there, is, a, lot, of, more, stuff, why, Diigo, Browser, might, easily, replace, Safari, on, your, iPad:, Incognito, mode,, MultiTouch, Options,, Desktop, Browser, mode,, and,, drumroll…, Ad, Blocking!, Again,, Diigo, Browser, might, take, a, little, time, to, get, used, to,, but, it, is, so, feature, packed, that, it, is, well, worth, an, extended, try-out, phase., If, you, like, Diigo,, and, you, will, like, Diigo, if, you, are, into, information, management,, this, app, is, a, jewel.,  , Start, Diigo, today,, and, make, the, web, your, own, Diigo, is, an, amazing, platform, for, organizing, the, web., Getting, started, with, Diigo, is, really, simple,, but, once, you, dive, deeper, into, its, sharing, and, collaboration, functions, its, getting, complicated, pretty, soon., You, are, not, alone, in, this:, I, will, talk, in, upcoming, posts, about, how, Diigo, fits, into, your, overall, information, management, workflow, and, what, tricks, Diigo, power, users, can, use,, so, make, sure, to, follow, academiPad, via, email,, RSS,, twitter, and/or, facebook., But, try, it, out, for, anything, between, 5, minutes, and, a, week,, and, I, am, sure, you, will, agree, with, me:, Diigo, is, one, of, the, best, information, management, tools, out, there., If, I, could, use, only, one, web, app, until, the, end, of, my, days, (or, the, end, of, the, internet, –, whatever, comes, first),, I, would, choose, Diigo.,  , Disclaimer:, All,

quite, costly., Imagine, having, to, phone, or, write, to, book, needed, articles,, books,, journals, weeks, in, advance., Or, spend, a, complete, day, travelling, to, your, nearest, decent, library, to, painfully, trawl, through, books,, take, notes, or, spend, what, was, quite, a, lot, back, then, to, make, copies., You, had, to, produce, well, written, and, presented, letters, to, people, you, might, want, to, interview, for, your, research, and, then, wait, patiently, for, their, reply., You, had, to, join, a, long, list, of, people, waiting, for, the, recommended, text, books, you, could, not, afford, and, allowed, maybe, three, days, before, you, had, to, give, them, back., And, you, had, no, choice, but, to, spend, a, bloody, fortune, on, books/journals., This, wasn’t, the, Victorian, age, by, the, way,, I’m, just, going, back, 25, –, 30, to, my, student/, Masters, days., I, hope, you, lot, know, how, easy, you, have, it, in, comparison, –, but, then, again,, I,

Sometimes, the, browser, just, stays, for, 10, minutes, trying, to, download, some, items., Sometimes, when, diigo, browser, is, closed, and, reopened, again, the, already, downloaded, items, for, offline, should, be, redownloaded, again., I, cannot, depend, on, a, read, it, later, service, like, this., Comparing, to, pocket,, this, is, way, less, reliable., Other, diigo, services, are, awesome, and, i, am, a, big, fan, for, them., Just, is, little, but, important, problem., Diigo, browser, can, highlight, and, bookmark, even, in, offline, and, even, after, closing, the, app, and, returning, to, it, when, going, online, it, will, update, my, library, with, the, highlights, and, bookmarks, done, offline., AWESOME!, Just, if, the, read, later, feature, in, diigo, browser, was,
