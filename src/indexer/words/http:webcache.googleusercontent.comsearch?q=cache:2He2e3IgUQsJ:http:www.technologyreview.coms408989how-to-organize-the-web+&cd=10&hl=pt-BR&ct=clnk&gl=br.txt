Microsoft, proposes, a, simple, solution, to, the, problem, of, information, overload:, lists., by, Erica, Naone, November, 2,, 2007, There, are, dozens, of, online, tools, for, organizing, information:, wikis,, social-bookmarking, sites, such, as, del.icio.us,, and, RSS, feed, readers,, among, other, things., Researchers, at, Microsoft’s, Live, Labs,, an, incubator, for, new, Internet-related, technologies, founded, in, 2006,, hope, that, a, tool, called, Listas, will, distinguish, itself, by, being, more, general, than, all, the, others., Listas, launched, at, the, recent, Web, 2.0, Summit, in, San, Francisco, and, is, available, for, preview, online., Basic, principle:, Listas,, a, technology, from, Microsoft’s, Live, Labs, that’s, now, available, for, preview,, aims, to, help, users, organize, all, their, online, data, into, lists., Listas, is,, put, simply,, about, making, lists., Users, can, make, their, own, lists,, by, either, typing, in, original, content, or, taking, clippings, from, Web, pages,, or, they, can, read, or, edit, public, lists., The, lists, can, include, almost, any, type, of, content,, including, images, and, videos., They, can, be, designated, either, public, or, private,, and, they, can, be, tagged, to, make, them, easier, to, search., Like, other, social-networking, sites,, Listas, also, allows, users, to, acknowledge, each, other, as, “friends.”, A, user’s, lists,, lists, made, by, his, or, her, friends,, and, public, lists, that, the, user, has, linked, to, are, all, collected, on, a, single, page, on, the, Listas, site., Downloading, and, installing, the, optional, Listas, toolbar,, which, is, built, to, work, with, Internet, Explorer,, makes, it, easy, to, grab, items, from, other, Web, pages, and, add, them, to, lists., Those, items, might, include, short, bits, of, text,, URLs,, or, blog, posts, or, product, listings, with, their, original, structure, intact., “Lists, are, a, fundamental, data, type, across, the, Web,”, says, Live, Labs, product, manager, Alex, Daley., “Whether, you, look, at, task, managers,, blogs,, RSS,, shopping, lists,, or, wish, lists,, they, share, a, simple,, linear, list, structure., A, great, deal, of, the, information, we, produce, and, consume, across, the, Web, is, in, this, structure.”, Similarly,, says, Daley,, the, virtue, of, Listas, is, its, generality:, it, allows, users, to, organize, data, in, whatever, way, they, want, and, begin, to, tease, out, trends., Gary, Flake,, founder, and, director, of, Live, Labs,, says, that, Listas, was, born, from, his, sense, that, his, information, online, was, no, longer, under, his, control., “There, was, just, an, awareness, I, had, that, my, data, was, spread, out, everywhere,”, he, says,, noting, that, the, more, involved, a, person, is, with, online, communities,, the, more, severe, this, problem, can, be., By, using, the, Listas, toolbar,, a, person, can, aggregate, all, of, his, or, her, contributions, to, online, communities, in, a, single, dashboard,, annotate, them,, and, share, them, with, others., Although, a, similar, effect, could, be, achieved, without, the, toolbar,, Flake, says, that, he, thinks, the, system, will, feel, incomplete, without, the, ease, that, the, toolbar, contributes, to, the, process., Other, companies, have, tried, to, address, the, problem, of, organizing, data, with, more, specific, tools., ZingLists,, for, example,, shares, some, features, with, Listas,, including, the, ability, to, make, lists, private, or, public., It, is, intended,, however,, as, a, productivity, tool,, according, to, its, developer,, Steve, Madsen., The, lists, on, ZingLists, take, the, more, traditional, form, of, to-do, lists,, while, Listas’s, lists, can, behave, like, to-do, lists,, blogs,, or, RSS, feeds,, depending, on, how, users, construct, them., IBM’s, Lotus, Connections,, a, business, product,, includes, a, bookmarking, system, called, Dogear, that, organizes, information, with, the, participation, of, a, networked, community., When, a, user, bookmarks, a, site,, up, pop, tags, that, other, users, have, added, to, it,, says, product, manager, Suzanne, Minassian., Dogear, also, shows, how, many, others, have, bookmarked, the, same, site, and, provides, links, that, can, lead, users, to, those, people., The, result,, Minassian, says,, is, that, users, can, find, people, with, shared, interests, and, connect, to, those, people, through, the, system., Listas’s, developers, are, still, working, on, increasing, community, involvement, with, the, site,, Flake, says., “With, all, community, sites,, there’s, a, bit, of, a, chicken-and-egg, dilemma,”, he, says,, noting, that, a, strong, community, attracts, more, community, activity., Live, Labs’, technology, previews, are, meant, to, be, even, more, raw, than, most, products’, early, releases,, Daley, says,, and, are, very, much, works, in, progress., “We, try, to, release, early, and, release, often,”, he, says., As, a, result,, many, changes, to, Listas, are, on, the, way., Some, of, those, changes, will, be, aimed, at, increasing, the, usability, of, the, interface., For, instance,, using, the, toolbar, to, clip, information, could, be, a, more, streamlined, process., Other, changes, will, advance, the, philosophy, of, the, service,, such, as, Flake’s, plan, to, change, the, way, comments, are, structured., With, most, of, today’s, blogs,, Flake, says,, if, you, post, a, comment,, that, information, no, longer, belongs, to, you:, you, often, can’t, edit, it, or, delete, it,, and, it’s, hosted, on, someone, else’s, page., Flake, says, that, he, plans, to, give, Listas, a, system, that, structures, comments, as, simply, another, list–one, belonging, to, the, person, posting, the, comments., If, Listas, does, well,, Microsoft, may, integrate, it, with, products, or, develop, it, as, a, product,, but, for, now,, the, researchers, say,, there, is, no, effort, to, make, it, profitable., “Listas, is, at, the, beginning, of, the, experiment,”, Daley, says., Tech, Obsessive?, Become, an, Insider, to, get, the, story,
