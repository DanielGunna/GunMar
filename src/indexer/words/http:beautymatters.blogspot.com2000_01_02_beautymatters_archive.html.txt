[Beauty, Matters, Home>>Creative, Arts>>Beauty, in, the, Ear, of, the, Beholder, Beauty, in, the, Ear, of, the, Beholder, "If, the, contemplation, of, something, beautiful, arouses, pleasurable, feelings,, this, effect, is, distinct, from, the, beautiful, as, such., I, may,, indeed,, place, a, beautiful, object, before, an, observer, with, the, avowed, purpose, of, giving, him, pleasure,, but, this, purpose, in, no, way, affects, the, beauty, of, the, object., The, beautiful, is, and, remains, beautiful, though, it, arouse, no, emotion, whatever,, and, though, there, be, no, one, to, look, at, it., In, other, words,, although, the, beautiful, exists, for, the, gratification, of, an, observer,, it, is, independent, of, him.", So, claimed, the, music, critic,, Eduard, Hanslick, in, 1854., Writing, at, a, time, when, the, opposing, schools, of, Brahms, and, Wagner, dominated, the, music, scene,, Hanslick’s, attempt, to, formulate, an, objective, evaluation, of, what, is, musically, beautiful, was, reactionary., His, insistence, that, human, emotions, cannot, be, used, in, making, a, judgement, of, beauty, in, music, flew, in, the, face, of, the, prevailing, expressive, values, of, late, nineteenth-century, Romanticism., Whilst, admitting, that, beautiful, music, may, move, the, listener, deeply,, Hanslick, believed, that, this, emotional, response, was, no, more, than, a, side-effect., The, true, beauty, of, the, music, was, to, be, found, within, the, music, itself., Perhaps, even, more, controversially, at, the, time,, Hanslick, claimed, further, that, beautiful, music, could, never, be, written, as, a, narrative, representation, of, an, event, or, other, specific, content:, ‘a, musician, cannot, but, find, this, method, hazardous, from, the, very, start,, since, it, demonstrates, that, music, is, only, the, afterthought., First, place, is, taken, by, the, poetical, material;, the, music, is, a, kind, of, brilliantly, illustrated, marginal, notation.’, Beauty, and, the, music, of, Wagner, Hanslick, followed, his, beliefs, about, musical, beauty, in, levelling, extensive, criticism, against, the, composer,, Wagner., Wagner, aimed, to, combine, art, and, literature, with, music, in, his, operas,, and, famously, developed, the, use, of, the, ‘leitmotiv’, or, musical, theme, to, represent, different, characters, on, the, stage., In, his, review, of, Wagner’s, opera, Lohengrin, in, 1858,, Hanslick, wrote, that, its, enthusiastic, reception, ‘would, be, more, readily, understood, by, a, deaf, person,, subject, only, to, the, impression, of, the, stage, sets,, the, processions,, the, groupings,, the, miming, of, the, principals,, than, by, someone, who, knew, nothing, of, Lohengrin, but, the, music.’, In, contrast,, Hanslick, writes, with, enthusiasm, about, the, music, of, Brahms,, a, contemporary, composer, writing, non-programmatic, symphonies, and, chamber, music., He, claimed, that, this, music, ‘has, the, virtue, of, not, seeking, effects, at, the, cost, of, intelligibility’, and, that, ‘there, is, no, seeking, after, applause, in, Brahms’, music,, no, narcissistic, affectation.’, Brahms’, approach, to, composition, obviously, satisfied, Hanslick’s, view, that, ‘music, demands, once, and, for, all, to, be, grasped, as, music’., Musical, beauty, in, early, twentieth-century, France, Hanslick’s, conviction, of, the, autonomous, beauty, of, music, foreshadows, the, development, of, ideas, about, musical, beauty, by, composers, in, the, twentieth, –century., In, France,, the, poet, Jean, Cocteau, launched, an, attack, against, the, influences, of, both, Wagner, and, Impressionism, in, Le, Coq, et, l’Arlequin,, whilst, the, composer,, Albert, Roussel, advocated, ‘a, music, satisfying, in, itself,, a, music, which, seeks, to, eliminate, all, picturesque, and, descriptive, elements.’, The, Austrian, composer,, Schoenberg, also, concluded, that, ‘by, producing, comprehensibility,, form, produces, beauty’., These, aesthetic, principles, lie, at, the, heart, of, the, philosopher, Susanne, Langer’s, later, theory, of, musical, appreciation., In, Feeling, and, Form, (1953), and, Problems, of, Art, (1957), she, suggested, that, music’s, power, to, interest, stems, from, its, formal, relations, to, the, patterns, of, human, feeling., Furthermore,, she, used, music, as, an, example, of, a, symbol, system, whose, symbols, are, not, necessarily, descriptive,, evocative, or, expressive., Objective, guidelines, for, musical, beauty, Hanslick’s, analysis, of, musical, beauty, as, being, independent, of, human, beings, lays, the, foundation, for, objective, standards, of, criticism, about, beauty, in, music., The, nature, of, objectivity, implies, the, comparison, of, a, work, to, an, ideal, or, absolute, truth., The, eighteenth-century, philosopher,, Immanuel, Kant, recognized, ‘objective’, principles, as, those, considered, to, be, applicable, to, the, whole, or, to, everyone., Similarly,, the, nineteenth-century, physiologist,, Claude, Bernard, believed, that, subjective, ideas, are, interior, and, bring, the, subject, an, impression, of, the, truth,, whilst, objective, ideas, are, exterior, and, are, based, on, observation, and, experimentation., Can, there, be, agreement, about, an, objective, standard, of, ideal, beauty, in, music, however,, or, does, the, essentially, personal, experience, of, musical, beauty, always, escape, such, generalisation?, Attempts, to, define, beauty, in, music, One, writer, who, attempts, to, answer, this, question, is, Lewis, Rowell., He, included, a, proposal, of, guidelines, for, musical, excellence, in, his, book,, Thinking, about, Music, (1983)., Although, he, recognized, the, controversy, surrounding, the, judgement, of, value, in, a, composition,, he, believed, that, a, work, would, be, more, likely, to, ‘deserve, a, rating’, if, it, conformed, to, the, criteria, he, suggested., He, described, pieces, that, fail, through, their, lack, of, a, ‘unified,, coherent, structure’, or, their, inability, to, ‘strike, an, appropriate, balance’, between, the, criteria, he, proposed., However,, his, statements, show, a, tendency, to, indicate, the, causes, of, failure, in, a, piece, of, music, rather, than, to, pinpoint, exactly, the, essential, ingredient, that, brings, successful, beauty, to, a, composition., Musical, beauty, evades, definition, An, ideal, of, beauty, in, music, appears, to, be, elusive, despite, wide-ranging, debate, on, the, subject., As, a, result,, guidelines, for, critical, evaluation, are, generally, based, on, previous, successes, in, music, rather, than, on, an, absolute, ideal., Attempts, to, set, out, objective, standards, of, criticism, for, beauty, in, music, are, therefore, concerned, primarily, with, outlining, reasons, for, the, failure, of, a, composition, to, be, beautiful., A, reversal, of, these, explanations, is, then, allowed, to, stand, as, an, explanation, of, musical, beauty., Whilst, the, first, of, these, processes, has, relevance, in, practice,, the, second, is, a, misguided, fallacy., Many, successful, pieces, of, music, bear, no, relation, to, the, guidelines, suggested, by, philosophers., The, inescapable, conclusion, is, that, a, personal, appreciation, of, beauty, in, music, may, ultimately, resist, any, objective, definition., Links, and, References, Eduard, Hanslick., (1854/1885), Vom, Musikalisch-Schönen., Translated, in, 1891, by, Gustav, Cohen, as:, The, Beautiful, in, Music., Indianapolis:, Bobbs-Merrill,
