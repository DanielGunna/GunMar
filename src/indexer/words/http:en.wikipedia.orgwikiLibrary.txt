and, Greek,, the, idea, of, a, bookcase, is, represented, by, Bibliotheca, and, Bibliothēkē, (Greek:, βιβλιοθήκη):, derivatives, of, these, mean, library, in, many, modern, languages,, e.g., French, bibliothèque., The, first, libraries, consisted, of, archives, of, the, earliest, form, of, writing—the, clay, tablets, in, cuneiform, script, discovered, in, Sumer,, some, dating, back, to, 2600,

libraries[edit], Tablet, from, the, Library, of, Ashurbanipal, containing, part, of, the, Epic, of, Gilgamesh, The, first, libraries, consisted, of, archives, of, the, earliest, form, of, writing—the, clay, tablets, in, cuneiform, script, discovered, in, temple, rooms, in, Sumer,[3][4], some, dating, back, to, 2600, BC.[5], These, archives,, which, mainly, consisted, of, the, records, of, commercial, transactions, or, inventories,, mark, the, end, of, prehistory, and, the, start, of, history.[6][7], Things, were, much, the, same, in, the, government, and, temple, records, on, papyrus, of, Ancient, Egypt.[4], The, earliest, discovered, private, archives, were, kept, at, Ugarit;, besides, correspondence, and, inventories,, texts, of, myths, may, have, been, standardized, practice-texts, for, teaching, new, scribes., There, is, also, evidence, of, libraries, at, Nippur, about, 1900, BC, and, those, at, Nineveh, about, 700, BC, showing, a, library, classification, system.[8], Over, 30,000, clay, tablets, from, the, Library, of, Ashurbanipal, have, been, discovered, at, Nineveh,[9], providing, modern, scholars, with, an, amazing, wealth, of, Mesopotamian, literary,, religious, and, administrative, work., Among, the, findings, were, the, Enuma, Elish,, also, known, as, the, Epic, of, Creation,[10], which, depicts, a, traditional, Babylonian, view, of, creation,, the, Epic, of, Gilgamesh,[11], a, large, selection, of, "omen, texts", including, Enuma, Anu, Enlil, which, "contained, omens, dealing, with, the, moon,, its, visibility,, eclipses,, and, conjunction, with, planets, and, fixed, stars,, the, sun,, its, corona,, spots,, and, eclipses,, the, weather,, namely, lightning,, thunder,, and, clouds,, and, the, planets, and, their, visibility,, appearance,, and, stations",[12], and, astronomic/astrological, texts,, as, well, as, standard, lists, used, by, scribes, and, scholars, such, as, word, lists,, bilingual, vocabularies,, lists, of, signs, and, synonyms,, and, lists, of, medical, diagnoses., Philosopher, Laozi, was, keeper, of, books, in, the, earliest, library, in, China,, which, belonged, to, the, Imperial, Zhou, dynasty.[13], Also,, evidence, of, catalogues, found, in, some, destroyed, ancient, libraries, illustrates, the, presence, of, librarians.[13], Classical, period[edit], Artistic, rendering, of, the, Library, of, Alexandria,, based, on, some, archaeological, evidence, The, Library, of, Alexandria,, in, Egypt,, was, the, largest, and, most, significant, great, library, of, the, ancient, world.[14], It, flourished, under, the, patronage, of, the, Ptolemaic, dynasty, and, functioned, as, a, major, center, of, scholarship, from, its, construction, in, the, 3rd, century, BC, until, the, Roman, conquest, of, Egypt, in, 30, BC., The, library, was, conceived, and, opened, either, during, the, reign, of, Ptolemy, I, Soter, (323–283, BC), or, during, the, reign, of, his, son, Ptolemy II, (283–246, BC).[15], An, early, organization, system, was, in, effect, at, Alexandria.[15], The, Library, of, Celsus, in, Ephesus,, Anatolia,, now, part, of, Selçuk,, Turkey, was, built, in, honor, of, the, Roman, Senator, Tiberius, Julius, Celsus, Polemaeanus[16][17], (completed, in, 135), by, Celsus’, son,, Gaius, Julius, Aquila, (consul,, 110, AD)., The, library, was, built, to, store, 12,000, scrolls, and, to, serve, as, a, monumental, tomb, for, Celsus., Private, or, personal, libraries, made, up, of, written, books, (as, opposed, to, the, state, or, institutional, records, kept, in, archives), appeared, in, classical, Greece, in, the, 5th, century, BC., The, celebrated, book, collectors, of, Hellenistic, Antiquity, were, listed, in, the, late, 2nd, century, in, Deipnosophistae., All, these, libraries, were, Greek;, the, cultivated, Hellenized, diners, in, Deipnosophistae, pass, over, the, libraries, of, Rome, in, silence., By, the, time, of, Augustus,, there, were, public, libraries, near, the, forums, of, Rome:, there, were, libraries, in, the, Porticus, Octaviae, near, the, Theatre, of, Marcellus,, in, the, temple, of, Apollo, Palatinus,, and, in, the, Bibliotheca, Ulpiana, in, the, Forum, of, Trajan., The, state, archives, were, kept, in, a, structure, on, the, slope, between, the, Roman, Forum, and, the, Capitoline, Hill., Private, libraries, appeared, during, the, late, republic:, Seneca, inveighed, against, libraries, fitted, out, for, show, by, illiterate, owners, who, scarcely, read, their, titles, in, the, course, of, a, lifetime,, but, displayed, the, scrolls, in, bookcases, (armaria), of, citrus, wood, inlaid, with, ivory, that, ran, right, to, the, ceiling:, "by, now,, like, bathrooms, and, hot, water,, a, library, is, got, up, as, standard, equipment, for, a, fine, house, (domus).[18], Libraries, were, amenities, suited, to, a, villa,, such, as, Cicero's, at, Tusculum,, Maecenas's, several, villas,, or, Pliny, the, Younger's,, all, described, in, surviving, letters., At, the, Villa, of, the, Papyri, at, Herculaneum,, apparently, the, villa, of, Caesar's, father-in-law,, the, Greek, library, has, been, partly, preserved, in, volcanic, ash;, archaeologists, speculate, that, a, Latin, library,, kept, separate, from, the, Greek, one,, may, await, discovery, at, the, site., Remains, of, the, Library, of, Celsus, at, Ephesus, In, the, West,, the, first, public, libraries, were, established, under, the, Roman, Empire, as, each, succeeding, emperor, strove, to, open, one, or, many, which, outshone, that, of, his, predecessor., Rome’s, first, public, library, was, established, by, Asinius, Pollio., Pollio, was, a, lieutenant, of, Julius, Caesar, and, one, of, his, most, ardent, supporters., After, his, military, victory, in, Illyria,, Pollio, felt, he, had, enough, fame, and, fortune, to, create, what, Julius, Caesar, had, sought, for, a, long, time:, a, public, library, to, increase, the, prestige, of, Rome, and, rival, the, one, in, Alexandria.[19], Pollios’s, library,, the, Anla, Libertatis,[20], which, was, housed, in, the, Atrium, Libertatis,, was, centrally, located, near, the, Forum, Romanum., It, was, the, first, to, employ, an, architectural, design, that, separated, works, into, Greek, and, Latin., All, subsequent, Roman, public, libraries, will, have, this, design.[21], At, the, conclusion, of, Rome’s, civil, wars, following, the, death, of, Marcus, Antonius, in, 30, BC,, the, Emperor, Augustus, sought, to, reconstruct, many, of, Rome’s, damaged, buildings., During, this, construction,, Augustus, created, two, more, public, libraries., The, first, was, the, library, of, the, Temple, of, Apollo, on, the, Palatine,, often, called, the, Palatine, library,, and, the, second, was, the, library, of, the, Porticus, of, Octaviae.[22], Two, more, libraries, were, added, by, the, Emperor, Tiberius, on, Palatine, Hill, and, one, by, Vespasian, after, 70, AD., Vespasian’s, library, was, constructed, in, the, Forum, of, Vespasian,, also, known, as, the, Forum, of, Peace,, and, became, one, of, Rome’s, principal, libraries., The, Bibliotheca, Pacis, was, built, along, the, traditional, model, and, had, two, large, halls, with, rooms, for, Greek, and, Latin, libraries, containing, the, works, of, Galen, and, Lucius, Aelius.[23], One, of, the, best, preserved, was, the, ancient, Ulpian, Library, built, by, the, Emperor, Trajan., Completed, in, 112/113,, the, Ulpian, Library, was, part, of, Trajan’s, Forum, built, on, the, Capitoline, Hill., Trajan’s, Column, separated, the, Greek, and, Latin, rooms, which, faced, each, other.[24], The, structure, was, approximately, fifty, feet, high, with, the, peak, of, the, roof, reaching, almost, seventy, feet.[25], Unlike, the, Greek, libraries,, readers, had, direct, access, to, the, scrolls,, which, were, kept, on, shelves, built, into, the, walls, of, a, large, room., Reading, or, copying, was, normally, done, in, the, room, itself., The, surviving, records, give, only, a, few, instances, of, lending, features., Most, of, the, large, Roman, baths, were, also, cultural, centres,, built, from, the, start, with, a, library,, a, two-room, arrangement, with, one, room, for, Greek, and, one, for, Latin, texts., Libraries, were, filled, with, parchment, scrolls, as, at, Library, of, Pergamum, and, on, papyrus, scrolls, as, at, Alexandria:, the, export, of, prepared, writing, materials, was, a, staple, of, commerce., There, were, a, few, institutional, or, royal, libraries, which, were, open, to, an, educated, public, (such, as, the, Serapeum, collection, of, the, Library, of, Alexandria,, once, the, largest, library, in, the, ancient, world),[15], but, on, the, whole, collections, were, private., In, those, rare, cases, where, it, was, possible, for, a, scholar, to, consult, library, books,, there, seems, to, have, been, no, direct, access, to, the, stacks., In, all, recorded, cases,, the, books, were, kept, in, a, relatively, small, room, where, the, staff, went, to, get, them, for, the, readers,, who, had, to, consult, them, in, an, adjoining, hall, or, covered, walkway., Han, Chinese, scholar, Liu, Xiang, established, the, first, library, classification, system, during, the, Han, dynasty,[26], and, the, first, book, notation, system., At, this, time,, the, library, catalogue, was, written, on, scrolls, of, fine, silk, and, stored, in, silk, bags., Late, Antiquity[edit], Malatestiana, Library, of, Cesena,, the, first, European, civic, library[27], During, the, Late, Antiquity, and, Middle, Ages, periods,, there, was, no, Rome, of, the, kind, that, ruled, the, Mediterranean, for, centuries, and, spawned, the, culture, that, produced, twenty-eight, public, libraries, in, the, urbs, Roma.[28], The, empire, had, been, divided, then, later, re-united, again, under, Constantine, the, Great, who, moved, the, capital, of, the, Roman, Empire, in, 330, AD, to, the, city, of, Byzantium, which, was, renamed, Constantinople.[29], The, Roman, intellectual, culture, that, flourished, in, ancient, times, was, undergoing, a, transformation, as, the, academic, world, moved, from, laymen, to, Christian, clergy.[30], As, the, West, crumbled,, books, and, libraries, flourished, and, flowed, east, toward, the, Byzantine, Empire.[31], There,, four, different, types, of, libraries, were, established:, imperial,, patriarchal,, monastic,, and, private.[32], Each, had, its, own, purpose, and,, as, a, result,, their, survival, varied., Christianity, was, a, new, force, in, Europe, and, many, of, the, faithful, saw, Hellenistic, culture, as, pagan., As, such,, many, classical, Greek, works,, written, on, scrolls,, were, left, to, decay, as, only, Christian, texts, were, thought, fit, for, preservation, in, a, codex,, the, progenitor, of, the, modern, book.[33], In, the, East,, however,, this, was, not, the, case, as, many, of, these, classical, Greek, and, Roman, texts, were, copied.[34], In, Byzantium,, much, of, this, work, devoted, to, preserving, Hellenistic, thought, in, codex, form, was, performed, in, scriptoriums, by, monks.[35], While, monastic, library, scriptoriums, flourished, throughout, the, East, and, West,, the, rules, governing, them, were, generally, the, same.[36], Barren, and, sun-lit, rooms, (because, candles, were, a, source, of, fire), were, major, features, of, the, scriptorium, that, was, both, a, model, of, production, and, monastic, piety.[37], Monks, scribbled, away, for, hours, a, day,, interrupted, only, by, meals, and, prayers.[38], With, such, production,, medieval, monasteries, began, to, accumulate, large, libraries., These, libraries, were, devoted, solely, to, the, education, of, the, monks, and, were, seen, as, essential, to, their, spiritual, development.[39], Although, most, of, these, texts, that, were, produced, were, Christian, in, nature,, many, monastic, leaders, saw, common, virtues, in, the, Greek, classics., As, a, result,, many, of, these, Greek, works, were, copied,, and, thus, saved,, in, monastic, scriptoriums.[40], When, Europe, passed, into, the, Dark, Ages,, Byzantine, scriptoriums, laboriously, preserved, Greco-Roman, classics., As, a, result,, Byzantium, revived, Classical, models, of, education, and, libraries.[41], The, Imperial, Library, of, Constantinople, was, an, important, depository, of, ancient, knowledge., Constantine, himself, wanted, such, a, library, but, his, short, rule, denied, him, the, ability, to, see, his, vision, to, fruition., His, son, Constantius, II, made, this, dream, a, reality, and, created, an, imperial, library, in, a, portico, of, the, royal, palace.[42], He, ruled, for, 24, years, and, accelerated, the, development, of, the, library, and, the, intellectual, culture, that, came, with, such, a, vast, accumulation, of, books.[43], Constantius, II, appointed, Themistius,, a, pagan, philosopher, and, teacher,, as, chief, architect, of, this, library, building, program., Themistius, set, about, a, bold, program, to, create, an, imperial, public, library, that, would, be, the, centerpiece, of, the, new, intellectual, capital, of, Constantinople.[44], Classical, authors, such, as, Plato,, Aristotle,, Demosthenes,, Isocrates,, Thucydides,, Homer,, and, Zeno, were, sought., Themeistius, hired, calligraphers, and, craftsman, to, produce, the, actual, codices., He, also, appointed, educators, and, created, a, university-like, school, centered, around, the, library.[45], After, the, death, of, Constantius, II,, Julian, the, Apostate,, a, bibliophile, intellectual,, ruled, briefly, for, less, than, three, years., Despite, this,, he, had, a, profound, impact, on, the, imperial, library, and, sought, both, Christian, and, pagan, books, for, its, collections.[42], Later,, the, Emperor, Valens, hired, Greek, and, Latin, scribes, full-time, with, funds, from, the, royal, treasury, to, copy, and, repair, manuscripts.[46], At, its, height, in, the, 5th, century,, the, Imperial, Library, of, Constantinople, had, 120,000, volumes, and, was, the, largest, library, in, Europe.[47], A, fire, in, 477, consumed, the, entire, library, but, it, was, rebuilt, only, to, be, burned, again, in, 726,, 1204,, and, in, 1453, when, Constantinople, fell, to, the, Ottoman, Turks.[48], Patriarchal, libraries, fared, no, better,, and, sometimes, worse,, than, the, Imperial, Library., The, Library, of, the, Patriarchate, of, Constantinople, was, founded, most, likely, during, the, reign, of, Constantine, the, Great, in, the, 4th, century.[49], As, a, theological, library,, it, was, known, to, have, employed, a, library, classification, system.[50], It, also, served, as, a, repository, of, several, ecumenical, councils, such, as, the, Council, of, Nicea,, Council, of, Ephesus,, and, the, Council, of, Chalcedon., The, library,, which, employed, a, librarian, and, assistants,, may, have, been, originally, located, in, the, Patriarch’s, official, residence, before, it, was, moved, to, the, Thomaites, Triclinus, in, the, 7th, century., While, much, is, not, known, about, the, actual, library, itself,, it, is, known, that, many, of, its, contents, were, subject, to, destruction, as, religious, in-fighting, ultimately, resulted, in, book, burnings.[51], During, this, period,, small, private, libraries, existed., Many, of, these, were, owned, by, church, members, and, the, aristocracy.[52], Teachers, also, were, known, to, have, small, personal, libraries, as, well, as, wealthy, bibliophiles, who, could, afford, the, highly, ornate, books, of, the, period.[53], Thus,, in, the, 6th, century,, at, the, close, of, the, Classical, period,, the, great, libraries, of, the, Mediterranean, world, remained, those, of, Constantinople, and, Alexandria., Cassiodorus,, minister, to, Theodoric,, established, a, monastery, at, Vivarium, in, the, toe, of, Italy, (modern, Calabria), with, a, library, where, he, attempted, to, bring, Greek, learning, to, Latin, readers, and, preserve, texts, both, sacred, and, secular, for, future, generations., As, its, unofficial, librarian,, Cassiodorus, not, only, collected, as, many, manuscripts, as, he, could,, he, also, wrote, treatises, aimed, at, instructing, his, monks, in, the, proper, uses, of, reading, and, methods, for, copying, texts, accurately., In, the, end,, however,, the, library, at, Vivarium, was, dispersed, and, lost, within, a, century., Through, Origen, and, especially, the, scholarly, presbyter, Pamphilus, of, Caesarea,, an, avid, collector, of, books, of, Scripture,, the, theological, school, of, Caesarea, won, a, reputation, for, having, the, most, extensive, ecclesiastical, library, of, the, time,, containing, more, than, 30,000, manuscripts:, Gregory, of, Nazianzus,, Basil, the, Great,, Jerome,, and, others, came, and, studied, there., Islamic, lands[edit], Inside, a, Qur'anic, Library, in, Chinguetti,, Mauritania, By, the, 8th, century,, first, Iranians, and, then, Arabs, had, imported, the, craft, of, papermaking, from, China,, with, a, paper, mill, already, at, work, in, Baghdad, in, 794., Early, paper, was, called, bagdatikos,, meaning, "from, Baghdad",, because, it, was, introduced, to, the, west, mainly, by, this, city.[54], By, the, 9th, century,, public, libraries, started, to, appear, in, many, Islamic, cities., They, were, called, "house, of, knowledge", or, dar, al-'ilm., They, were, each, endowed, by, Islamic, sects, with, the, purpose, of, representing, their, tenets, as, well, as, promoting, the, dissemination, of, secular, knowledge., The, 9th-century, Abbasid, Caliph, al-Mutawakkil, of, Iraq,, ordered, the, construction, of, a, "zawiyat, qurra" –, an, enclosure, for, readers, which, was, "lavishly, furnished, and, equipped"., In, Shiraz,, Adhud, al-Daula, (d., 983), set, up, a, library,, described, by, the, medieval, historian,, al-Muqaddasi,, as, "a, complex, of, buildings, surrounded, by, gardens, with, lakes, and, waterways., The, buildings, were, topped, with, domes,, and, comprised, an, upper, and, a, lower, story, with, a, total,, according, to, the, chief, official,, of, 360, rooms...., In, each, department,, catalogues, were, placed, on, a, shelf..., the, rooms, were, furnished, with, carpets".[55], The, libraries, often, employed, translators, and, copyists, in, large, numbers,, in, order, to, render, into, Arabic, the, bulk, of, the, available, Persian,, Greek,, Roman, and, Sanskrit, non-fiction, and, the, classics, of, literature., Organization, was, a, strength, of, Islamic, Libraries, during, the, Golden, Age, (7th, -14th, century)., In, this, period,, books, were, organized, by, subject., Within, the, subject,, the, materials, were, further, organized, by, when, the, libraries, gained, the, item,, not, by, last, name, of, the, author, or, the, title, of, the, book., Also,, Islamic, libraries, may, be, the, first, to, have, implemented, a, catalogue, of, owned, materials., The, content, of, a, bookshelf, was, recorded, on, paper, and, attached, to, the, end, of, shelf., Arab-Islamic, people, also, were, very, favorable, of, public, knowledge., Public, libraries, were, very, popular, along, with, mosque,, private,, and, academic, libraries., Instead, of, only, societies, most, elite,, such, as, caliphs, and, princes,, information, was, something, that, was, offered, to, everyone., Some, of, the, libraries, were, said, to, let, patrons, check, out, up, to, 200, items., These, buildings, were, also, made, for, comfort, of, the, readers, and, information, seekers., It, was, said, that, the, rooms, had, carpets, for, sitting, and, reading, comfortably., Also,, openings, such, as, doors, and, windows, were, secured, closed, as, to, protect, patrons, against, cold, drafts.[56], This, flowering, of, Islamic, learning, ceased, centuries, later, when, learning, began, declining, in, the, Islamic, world,, after, many, of, these, libraries, were, destroyed, by, Mongol, invasions., Others, were, victim, of, wars, and, religious, strife, in, the, Islamic, world., However,, a, few, examples, of, these, medieval, libraries,, such, as, the, libraries, of, Chinguetti, in, West, Africa,, remain, intact, and, relatively, unchanged., Another, ancient, library, from, this, period, which, is, still, operational, and, expanding, is, the, Central, Library, of, Astan, Quds, Razavi, in, the, Iranian, city, of, Mashhad,, which, has, been, operating, for, more, than, six, centuries., The, contents, of, these, Islamic, libraries, were, copied, by, Christian, monks, in, Muslim/Christian, border, areas,, particularly, Spain, and, Sicily., From, there, they, eventually, made, their, way, into, other, parts, of, Christian, Europe., These, copies, joined, works, that, had, been, preserved, directly, by, Christian, monks, from, Greek, and, Roman, originals,, as, well, as, copies, Western, Christian, monks, made, of, Byzantine, works., The, resulting, conglomerate, libraries, are, the, basis, of, every, modern, library, today., Buddhist, scriptures,, educational, materials,, and, histories, were, stored, in, libraries, in, pre-modern, Southeast, Asia., In, Burma,, a, royal, library, called, the, Pitakataik, was, legendarily, founded, by, King, Anawrahta;[57], in, the, 18th, century,, British, envoy, Michael, Symes,, on, visiting, this, library,, wrote, that, "it, is, not, improbable, that, his, Birman, majesty, may, possess, a, more, numerous, library, than, any, potentate,, from, the, banks, of, the, Danube, to, the, borders, of, China"., In, Thailand,, libraries, called, ho, trai, were, built, throughout, the, country,, usually, on, stilts, above, a, pond, to, prevent, bugs, from, eating, at, the, books., Islam[edit], Qur'an, manuscript, on, display, at, the, Bibliotheca, Alexandrina, The, centrality, of, the, Qurʾān, as, the, prototype, of, the, written, word, in, Islam, bears, significantly, on, the, role, of, books, within, its, intellectual, tradition, and, educational, system.[58], An, early, impulse, in, Islam, was, to, manage, reports, of, events,, key, figures, and, their, sayings, and, actions., Thus,, "the, onus, of, being, the, last, 'People, of, the, Book', engendered, an, ethos, of, [librarianship]"[59], early, on, and, the, establishment, of, important, book, repositories, throughout, the, Muslim, world, has, occurred, ever, since., Upon, the, spread, of, Islam,, libraries, in, newly, Islamic, lands, knew, a, brief, period, of, expansion, in, the, Middle, East,, North, Africa,, Sicily,, and, Spain., Like, the, Christian, libraries,, they, mostly, contained, books, which, were, made, of, paper,, and, took, a, codex, or, modern, form, instead, of, scrolls;, they, could, be, found, in, mosques,, private, homes,, and, universities,, from, Timbuktu, to, Afghanistan, and, modern, day, Pakistan., In, Aleppo,, for, example,, the, largest, and, probably, the, oldest, mosque, library,, the, Sufiya,, located, at, the, city's, Grand, Umayyad, Mosque,, contained, a, large, book, collection, of, which, 10,000, volumes, were, reportedly, bequeathed, by, the, city's, most, famous, ruler,, Prince, Sayf, al-Dawla.[60], Ibn, al-Nadim's, bibliography, Fihrist, demonstrates, the, devotion, of, medieval, Muslim, scholars, to, books, and, reliable, sources;, it, contains, a, description, of, thousands, of, books, circulating, in, the, Islamic, world, circa, 1000,, including, an, entire, section, for, books, about, the, doctrines, of, other, religions., Modern, Islamic, libraries, for, the, most, part, do, not, hold, these, antique, books;, many, were, lost,, destroyed, by, Mongols,[61], or, removed, to, European, libraries, and, museums, during, the, colonial, period.[62], European, Middle, Ages[edit], Science, library, of, Upper, Lusatia, in, Görlitz,, Germany, In, the, Early, Middle, Ages,, monastery, libraries, developed,, such, as, the, important, one, at, the, Abbey, of, Montecassino, in, Italy.[63], Books, were, usually, chained, to, the, shelves,, reflecting, the, fact, that, manuscripts,, which, were, created, via, the, labour-intensive, process, of, hand, copying,, were, valuable, possessions.[64], This, hand-copying, was, often, accomplished, by, travelling, monks, who, made, the, treks, to, the, sources, of, knowledge, and, illumination, they, sought, for, learning, or, to, copy, the, manuscripts, held, by, other, monasteries, for, their, own, monastic, libraries.[65], Despite, this, protectiveness,, many, libraries, loaned, books, if, provided, with, security, deposits, (usually, money, or, a, book, of, equal, value)., Lending, was, a, means, by, which, books, could, be, copied, and, spread., In, 1212,, the, council, of, Paris, condemned, those, monasteries, that, still, forbade, loaning, books,, reminding, them, that, lending, is, "one, of, the, chief, works, of, mercy."[66], The, early, libraries, located, in, monastic, cloisters, and, associated, with, scriptoria, were, collections, of, lecterns, with, books, chained, to, them., Shelves, built, above, and, between, back-to-back, lecterns, were, the, beginning, of, bookpresses., The, chain, was, attached, at, the, fore-edge, of, a, book, rather, than, to, its, spine., Book, presses, came, to, be, arranged, in, carrels, (perpendicular, to, the, walls, and, therefore, to, the, windows), in, order, to, maximize, lighting,, with, low, bookcases, in, front, of, the, windows., This, "stall, system", (i.e., fixed, bookcases, perpendicular, to, exterior, walls, pierced, by, closely, spaced, windows), was, characteristic, of, English, institutional, libraries., In, European, libraries,, bookcases, were, arranged, parallel, to, and, against, the, walls., This, "wall, system", was, first, introduced, on, a, large, scale, in, Spain's, El, Escorial., Also,, in, Eastern, Christianity, monastery, libraries, kept, important, manuscripts., The, most, important, of, them, were, the, ones, in, the, monasteries, of, Mount, Athos, for, Orthodox, Christians,, and, the, library, of, the, Saint, Catherine's, Monastery, in, the, Sinai, Peninsula,, Egypt, for, the, Coptic, Church., Renaissance[edit], Reading, room, of, the, Laurentian, Library, From, the, 15th, century, in, central, and, northern, Italy,, libraries, of, humanists, and, their, enlightened, patrons, provided, a, nucleus, around, which, an, "academy", of, scholars, congregated, in, each, Italian, city, of, consequence., Malatesta, Novello,, lord, of, Cesena,, founded, the, Malatestiana, Library., Cosimo, de', Medici, in, Florence, established, his, own, collection,, which, formed, the, basis, of, the, Laurentian, Library.[67], In, Rome,, the, papal, collections, were, brought, together, by, Pope, Nicholas, V,, in, separate, Greek, and, Latin, libraries,, and, housed, by, Pope, Sixtus, IV,, who, consigned, the, Bibliotheca, Apostolica, Vaticana, to, the, care, of, his, librarian,, the, humanist, Bartolomeo, Platina, in, February, 1475.[68], In, the, 16th, century,, Sixtus, V, bisected, Bramante's, Cortile, del, Belvedere, with, a, cross-wing, to, house, the, Apostolic, Library, in, suitable, magnificence., The, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, saw, other, privately, endowed, libraries, assembled, in, Rome:, the, Vallicelliana,, formed, from, the, books, of, Saint, Filippo, Neri,, with, other, distinguished, libraries, such, as, that, of, Cesare, Baronio,, the, Biblioteca, Angelica, founded, by, the, Augustinian, Angelo, Rocca,, which, was, the, only, truly, public, library, in, Counter-Reformation, Rome;, the, Biblioteca, Alessandrina, with, which, Pope, Alexander, VII, endowed, the, University, of, Rome;, the, Biblioteca, Casanatense, of, the, Cardinal, Girolamo, Casanata;, and, finally, the, Biblioteca, Corsiniana, founded, by, the, bibliophile, Clement, XII, Corsini, and, his, nephew, Cardinal, Neri, Corsini,, still, housed, in, Palazzo, Corsini, in, via, della, Lungara., The, Republic, of, Venice, patronized, the, foundation, of, the, Biblioteca, Marciana,, based, on, the, library, of, Cardinal, Basilios, Bessarion., In, Milan,, Cardinal, Federico, Borromeo, founded, the, Biblioteca, Ambrosiana., This, trend, soon, spread, outside, of, Italy,, for, example, Louis, III,, Elector, Palatine, founded, the, Bibliotheca, Palatina, of, Heidelberg., These, libraries, don't, have, as, many, volumes, as, the, modern, libraries., However,, they, keep, many, valuable, manuscripts, of, Greek,, Latin,, and, Biblical, works., Tianyi, Chamber,, founded, in, 1561, by, Fan, Qin, during, the, Ming, dynasty,, is, the, oldest, existing, library, in, China., In, its, heyday,, it, boasted, a, collection, of, 70,000, volumes, of, antique, books., Enlightenment, era, libraries[edit], Thomas, Bodley, founded, the, Bodleian, Library, in, 1602, as, an, early, public, library., The, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, include, what, is, known, as, a, golden, age, of, libraries;[69], during, this, some, of, the, more, important, libraries, were, founded, in, Europe., Francis, Trigge, Chained, Library, of, St., Wulfram's, Church,, Grantham,, Lincolnshire, was, founded, in, 1598, by, the, rector, of, nearby, Welbourne.[70], Thomas, Bodley, founded, the, Bodleian, Library,, which, was, open, to, the, "whole, republic, of, the, learned",, Norwich, City, library, was, established, in, 1608,[71], and, the, British, Library, was, established, in, 1753., Chetham's, Library, in, Manchester,, which, claims, to, be, the, oldest, public, library, in, the, English-speaking, world,, opened, in, 1653.[72], Other, early, town, libraries, of, the, UK, include, those, of, Ipswich, (1612),, Bristol, (founded, in, 1613, and, opened, in, 1615),, and, Leicester, (1632)., Shrewsbury, School, also, opened, its, library, to, townsfolk.[73], The, Mazarine, Library, and, the, Bibliothèque, Sainte-Geneviève, were, founded, in, Paris,, the, Austrian, National, Library, in, Vienna,, the, National, Central, Library, in, Florence,, the, Prussian, State, Library, in, Berlin,, the, Załuski, Library, in, Warsaw,, and, the, M.E., Saltykov-Shchedrin, State, Public, Library, in, St, Petersburg.[74], The, Long, Room,, an, early, 18th, century, university, library, in, Trinity, College,, Dublin,, Ireland, At, the, start, of, the, 18th, century,, libraries, were, becoming, increasingly, public, and, were, more, frequently, lending, libraries., The, 18th, century, saw, the, switch, from, closed, parochial, libraries, to, lending, libraries., Before, this, time,, public, libraries, were, parochial, in, nature, and, libraries, frequently, chained, their, books, to, desks.[75], Libraries, also, were, not, uniformly, open, to, the, public.[76], Even, though, the, British, Museum, existed, at, this, time, and, contained, over, 50,000, books,, the, national, library, was, not, open, to, the, public,, or, even, to, a, majority, of, the, population., Access, to, the, Museum, depended, on, passes,, of, which, there, was, sometimes, a, waiting, period, of, three, to, four, weeks., Moreover,, the, library, was, not, open, to, browsing., Once, a, pass, to, the, library, had, been, issued,, the, reader, was, taken, on, a, tour, of, the, library., Many, readers, complained, that, the, tour, was, much, too, short.[77], Subscription, libraries[edit], Main, article:, Subscription, library, The, British, Museum, was, established, in, 1751, and, had, a, library, containing, over, 50,000, books., At, the, start, of, the, 19th, century,, there, were, virtually, no, public, libraries, in, the, sense, in, which, we, now, understand, the, term, i.e., libraries, provided, from, public, funds, and, freely, accessible, to, all.[78], Only, one, important, library, in, Britain,, namely, Chetham's, Library, in, Manchester,, was, fully, and, freely, accessible, to, the, public.[78], However,, there, had, come, into, being, a, whole, network, of, library, provision, on, a, private, or, institutional, basis., The, increase, in, secular, literature, at, this, time, encouraged, the, spread, of, lending, libraries,, especially, the, commercial, subscription, libraries., Many, small,, private, book, clubs, evolved, into, subscription, libraries,, charging, high, annual, fees, or, requiring, subscribing, members, to, purchase, shares, in, the, libraries., The, materials, available, to, subscribers, tended, to, focus, on, particular, subject, areas,, such, as, biography,, history,, philosophy,, theology,, and, travel,, rather, than, works, of, fiction,, particularly, the, novel., Unlike, a, public, library,, access, was, often, restricted, to, members., Some, of, the, earliest, such, institutions, were, founded, in, late, 17th, century, England,, such, as, Chetham's, Library, in, 1653,, Innerpeffray, Library, in, 1680,, and, Thomas, Plume's, Library, in, 1704., In, the, American, colonies,, the, Library, Company, of, Philadelphia, was, started, in, 1731, by, Benjamin, Franklin, in, Philadelphia., Parochial, libraries, attached, to, Anglican, parishes, or, Nonconformist, chapels, in, Britain, emerged, in, the, early, 18th, century,, and, prepared, the, way, for, local, public, libraries.[79], The, increasing, production, and, demand, for, fiction, promoted, by, commercial, markets, led, to, the, rise, of, circulating, libraries,, which, met, a, need, that, subscription, libraries, did, not, fulfil., William, Bathoe, claimed, that, his, commercial, venture, was, ‘the, Original, Circulating, library’,, opening, doors, at, two, locations, in, London, in, 1737.[80][81], Circulating, libraries, also, charged, subscription, fees, to, users, and, offered, serious, subject, matter, as, well, as, the, popular, novels,, thus, the, difficulty, in, clearly, distinguishing, circulating, from, subscription, libraries.[82], Biblioteka, Załuskich,, built, in, Warsaw, in, the, mid, 18th, century, Subscription, libraries, were, democratic, in, nature;, created, by, and, for, communities, of, local, subscribers, who, aimed, to, establish, permanent, collections, of, books, and, reading, materials,, rather, than, selling, their, collections, annually, as, the, circulating, libraries, tended, to, do,, in, order, to, raise, funds, to, support, their, other, commercial, interests., Even, though, the, subscription, libraries, were, often, founded, by, reading, societies,, committees,, elected, by, the, subscribers,, chose, books, for, the, collection, that, were, general,, rather, than, aimed, at, a, particular, religious,, political, or, professional, group., The, books, selected, for, the, collection, were, chosen, because, they, would, be, mutually, beneficial, to, the, shareholders., The, committee, also, selected, the, librarians, who, would, manage, the, circulation, of, materials.[83], In, Britain,, there, were, more, than, 200, commercial, circulating, libraries, open, in, 1800,, more, than, twice, the, number, of, subscription, and, private, proprietary, libraries, that, were, operating, at, the, same, time., Many, proprietors, pandered, to, the, most, fashionable, clientele,, making, much, ado, about, the, sort, of, shop, they, offered,, the, lush, interiors,, plenty, of, room, and, long, hours, of, service.[80], "These, 'libraries', would, be, called, rental, collections, today."[84], Private, libraries[edit], The, Linen, Hall, Library, in, Belfast, was, an, 18th-century, subscription, library., Pictured, in, 1888,, shortly, before, its, demolition., Private, subscription, libraries, functioned, in, much, the, same, manner, as, commercial, subscription, libraries,, though, they, varied, in, many, important, ways., One, of, the, most, popular, versions, of, the, private, subscription, library, was, a, gentleman's, only, library., Membership, was, restricted, to, the, proprietors, or, shareholders,, and, ranged, from, a, dozen, or, two, to, between, four, and, five, hundred.[85], The, Liverpool, Subscription, Library, was, a, gentlemen, only, library., In, 1798,, it, was, renamed, the, Athenaeum, when, it, was, rebuilt, with, a, newsroom, and, coffeehouse., It, had, an, entrance, fee, of, one, guinea, and, annual, subscription, of, five, shillings.[86], An, analysis, of, the, registers, for, the, first, twelve, years, provides, glimpses, of, middle-class, reading, habits, in, a, mercantile, community, at, this, period., The, largest, and, most, popular, sections, of, the, library, were, History,, Antiquities,, and, Geography,, with, 283, titles, and, 6,121, borrowings,, and, Belles, Lettres,, with, 238, titles, and, 3,313, borrowings.[87][88], Circulating, library, and, stationery, shop,, Gulgong,, Australia, 1870, Private, subscription, libraries, held, a, greater, amount, of, control, over, both, membership, and, the, types, of, books, in, the, library., There, was, almost, a, complete, elimination, of, cheap, fiction, in, the, private, societies.[89], Subscription, libraries, prided, themselves, on, respectability., The, highest, percentage, of, subscribers, were, often, landed, proprietors,, gentry,, and, old, professions.[90], Towards, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, and, in, the, first, decades, of, the, nineteenth,, the, need, for, books, and, general, education, made, itself, felt, among, social, classes, created, by, the, beginnings, of, the, Industrial, Revolution.[91], The, late, 18th, century, saw, a, rise, in, subscription, libraries, intended, for, the, use, of, tradesmen., In, 1797,, there, was, established, at, Kendal, what, was, known, as, the, Economical, Library,, "designed, principally, for, the, use, and, instruction, of, the, working, classes."[92], There, was, also, the, Artizans', library, established, at, Birmingham, in, 1799., The, entrance, fee, was, 3, shillings., The, subscription, was, 1, shilling, 6, pence, per, quarter., This, was, a, library, of, general, literature., Novels,, at, first, excluded,, were, afterwards, admitted, on, condition, that, they, did, not, account, for, more, than, one-tenth, of, the, annual, income.[85], National, libraries[edit], Main, article:, National, library, The, Lindisfarne, Gospels, is, but, one, of, the, treasures, made, available, in, the, British, Museum, upon, its, establishment, in, 1753., The, first, national, libraries, had, their, origins, in, the, royal, collections, of, the, sovereign, or, some, other, supreme, body, of, the, state., One, of, the, first, plans, for, a, national, library, was, devised, by, the, Welsh, mathematician, John, Dee,, who, in, 1556, presented, Mary, I, of, England, with, a, visionary, plan, for, the, preservation, of, old, books,, manuscripts, and, records, and, the, founding, of, a, national, library,, but, his, proposal, was, not, taken, up.[93], The, first, true, national, library, was, founded, in, 1753, as, part, of, the, British, Museum., This, new, institution, was, the, first, of, a, new, kind, of, museum, –, national,, belonging, to, neither, church, nor, king,, freely, open, to, the, public, and, aiming, to, collect, everything.[94], The, museum's, foundations, lay, in, the, will, of, the, physician, and, naturalist, Sir, Hans, Sloane,, who, gathered, an, enviable, collection, of, curiosities, over, his, lifetime, which, he, bequeathed, to, the, nation, for, £20,000.[95], Sloane's, collection, included, some, 40,000, printed, books, and, 7,000, manuscripts,, as, well, as, prints, and, drawings.[96], The, British, Museum, Act, 1753, also, incorporated, the, Cotton, library, and, the, Harleian, library., These, were, joined, in, 1757, by, the, Royal, Library,, assembled, by, various, British, monarchs.[97], In, France,, the, first, national, library, was, the, Bibliothèque, Mazarine,, which, evolved, from, its, origin, as, a, royal, library, founded, at, the, Louvre, Palace, by, Charles, V, in, 1368., The, appointment, of, Jacques, Auguste, de, Thou, as, librarian, in, the, 17th, century,, initiated, a, period, of, development, that, made, it, the, largest, and, richest, collection, of, books, in, the, world.[98], The, library, opened, to, the, public, in, 1692,, under, the, administration, of, Abbé, Louvois,, Minister, Louvois's, son., Abbé, Louvois, was, succeeded, by, the, Abbé, Bignon,, or, Bignon, II, as, he, was, termed,, who, instituted, a, complete, reform, of, the, library's, system., Catalogues, were, made,, which, appeared, from, 1739, to, 1753, in, 11, volumes., The, collections, increased, steadily, by, purchase, and, gift, to, the, outbreak, of, the, French, Revolution,, at, which, time, it, was, in, grave, danger, of, partial, or, total, destruction,, but, owing, to, the, activities, of, Antoine-Augustin, Renouard, and, Joseph, Van, Praet, it, suffered, no, injury.[98], The, library's, collections, swelled, to, over, 300,000, volumes, during, the, radical, phase, of, the, French, Revolution, when, the, private, libraries, of, aristocrats, and, clergy, were, seized., After, the, establishment, of, the, French, First, Republic, in, September, 1792,, "the, Assembly, declared, the, Bibliotheque, du, Roi, to, be, national, property, and, the, institution, was, renamed, the, Bibliothèque, Nationale., After, four, centuries, of, control, by, the, Crown,, this, great, library, now, became, the, property, of, the, French, people."[99], Modern, public, library[edit], Main, article:, Public, library, James, Silk, Buckingham, led, the, campaign, for, public, libraries, in, the, mid, 19th, century., Although, by, the, mid-19th, century,, England, could, claim, 274, subscription, libraries, and, Scotland,, 266,, the, foundation, of, the, modern, public, library, system, in, Britain, is, the, Public, Libraries, Act, 1850., The, Act, first, gave, local, boroughs, the, power, to, establish, free, public, libraries, and, was, the, first, legislative, step, toward, the, creation, of, an, enduring, national, institution, that, provides, universal, free, access, to, information, and, literature., In, the, 1830s,, at, the, height, of, the, Chartist, movement,, there, was, a, general, tendency, towards, reformism, in, the, United, Kingdom., The, Capitalist, economic, model, had, created, a, significant, amount, of, free, time, for, workers,, and, the, middle, classes, were, concerned, that, the, workers’, free, time, was, not, being, well-spent., This, was, prompted, more, by, Victorian, middle, class, paternalism, rather, than, by, demand, from, the, lower, social, orders.[100], Campaigners, felt, that, encouraging, the, lower, classes, to, spend, their, free, time, on, morally, uplifting, activities,, such, as, reading,, would, promote, greater, social, good.[101], In, 1835,, and, against, government, opposition,, James, Silk, Buckingham,, MP, for, Sheffield, and, a, supporter, of, the, temperance, movement,, was, able, to, secure, the, Chair, of, the, Select, Committee, which, would, examine, "the, extent,, causes,, and, consequences, of, the, prevailing, vice, of, intoxication, among, the, labouring, classes, of, the, United, Kingdom", and, propose, solutions., Francis, Place,, a, campaigner, for, the, working, class,, agreed, that, "the, establishment, of, parish, libraries, and, district, reading, rooms,, and, popular, lectures, on, subjects, both, entertaining, and, instructive, to, the, community, might, draw, off, a, number, of, those, who, now, frequent, public, houses, for, the, sole, enjoyment, they, afford".[102], Buckingham, introduced, to, Parliament, a, Public, Institution, Bill, allowing, boroughs, to, charge, a, tax, to, set, up, libraries, and, museums,, the, first, of, its, kind., Although, this, did, not, become, law,, it, had, a, major, influence, on, William, Ewart, MP, and, Joseph, Brotherton, MP,, who, introduced, a, bill, which, would, “[empower], boroughs, with, a, population, of, 10,000, or, more, to, raise, a, ½d, for, the, establishment, of, museums”.[103], This, became, the, Museums, Act, 1845., The, advocacy, of, Ewart, and, Brotherton, then, succeeded, in, having, a, select, committee, set, up, to, consider, public, library, provision., The, Report, argued, that, the, provision, of, public, libraries, would, steer, people, towards, temperate, and, moderate, habits., With, a, view, to, maximising, the, potential, of, current, facilities,, the, Committee, made, two, significant, recommendations., They, suggested, that, the, government, should, issue, grants, to, aid, the, foundation, of, libraries, and, that, the, Museums, Act, 1845, should, be, amended, and, extended, to, allow, for, a, tax, to, be, levied, for, the, establishment, of, public, libraries.[104][105][106], The, Bill, passed, through, Parliament, as, most, MPs, felt, that, public, libraries, would, provide, facilities, for, self-improvement, through, books, and, reading, for, all, classes,, and, that, the, greater, levels, of, education, attained, by, providing, public, libraries, would, result, in, lower, crime, rates., The, earliest, example, in, England, of, a, library, to, be, endowed, for, the, benefit, of, users, who, were, not, members, of, an, institution, such, as, a, cathedral, or, college, was, the, Francis, Trigge, Chained, Library, in, Grantham,, Lincolnshire,, established, in, 1598., The, library, still, exists, and, can, justifiably, claim, to, be, the, forerunner, of, later, public, library, systems., The, beginning, of, the, modern,, free,, open, access, libraries, really, got, its, start, in, the, UK, in, 1847., Parliament, appointed, a, committee,, led, by, William, Ewart,, on, Public, Libraries, to, consider, the, necessity, of, establishing, libraries, through, the, nation:, In, 1849,, their, report, noted, the, poor, condition, of, library, service,, it, recommended, the, establishment, of, free, public, libraries, all, over, the, country,, and, it, led, to, the, Public, Libraries, Act, in, 1850,, which, allowed, all, cities, with, populations, exceeding, 10,000, to, levy, taxes, for, the, support, of, public, libraries., The, turn, of, the, 20th, century, witnessed, a, tremendous, expansion, in, the, provision, of, public, libraries, in, the, English-speaking, world., Pictured,, the, Peter, White, Public, Library, built, in, 1905., Salford, Museum, and, Art, Gallery, first, opened, in, November, 1850, as, "The, Royal, Museum, &, Public, Library",, as, the, first, unconditionally, free, public, library, in, England.[107][108], The, library, in, Campfield,, Manchester, was, the, first, library, to, operate, a, free, lending, library, without, subscription, in, 1852.[109], Norwich, lays, claims, to, being, the, first, municipality, to, adopt, the, Public, Libraries, Act, 1850, (which, allowed, any, municipal, borough, with, a, population, of, 100,000, or, more, to, introduce, a, halfpenny, rate, to, establish, public, libraries—although, not, to, buy, books)., Norwich, was, the, eleventh, library, to, open,, in, 1857,, after, Winchester,, Manchester,, Liverpool,, Bolton,, Kidderminster,, Cambridge,, Birkenhead,, and, Sheffield., Another, important, act, was, the, Education, Act, 1870,, which, increased, literacy, and, thereby, the, demand, for, libraries., By, 1877,, more, than, 75, cities, had, established, free, libraries,, and, by, 1900, the, number, had, reached, 300.[110], This, finally, marks, the, start, of, the, public, library, as, we, know, it., And, these, acts, influenced, similar, laws, in, other, countries,, such, as, the, US., The, first, tax-supported, public, library, in, the, United, States, was, Peterborough,, New, Hampshire, (1833), first, supported, by, state, funds, then, an, "Act, Providing, for, the, Establishment, of, Public, Libraries", in, 1849.[111], Expansion[edit], Andrew, Carnegie, played, an, important, role, in, financing, public, libraries, across, the, English-speaking, world., The, year, 1876, is, key, in, the, history, of, librarianship, in, the, United, States., The, American, Library, Association, was, formed,, as, well, as, The, American, Library, Journal,, Melvil, Dewey, published, his, decimal-based, system, of, classification,, and, the, United, States, Bureau, of, Education, published, its, report,, "Public, libraries, in, the, United, States, of, America;, their, history,, condition,, and, management.", During, the, post-Civil, War, years,, there, was, a, rise, in, the, establishment, of, public, libraries,, a, movement, led, chiefly, by, newly, formed, women's, clubs., They, contributed, their, own, collections, of, books,, conducted, lengthy, fund, raising, campaigns, for, buildings,, and, lobbied, within, their, communities, for, financial, support, for, libraries,, as, well, as, with, legislatures, and, the, Carnegie, Library, Endowment, founded, in, the, 20th, century.[112], They, led, the, establishment, of, 75–80, percent, of, the, libraries, in, communities, across, the, country.[113], Philanthropists, and, businessmen,, including, John, Passmore, Edwards,, Henry, Tate, and, Andrew, Carnegie,, helped, to, increase, the, number, of, public, libraries, from, the, late, 19th, century., Carnegie, alone, built, over, 2000, libraries, in, the, US,, 660, Carnegie, Libraries, in, Britain,, in, addition, to, many, more, in, the, Commonwealth.[114], Carnegie, also, funded, academic, libraries,, favoring, small, schools, and, schools, with, African, American, students., “In, 1899,, Pennsylvania, State, College, became, the, first, college, to, receive, Carnegie, funding, ($150,000), and, their, library, was, constructed, in, 1903.”[115], Types[edit], Many, institutions, make, a, distinction, between, a, circulating, or, lending, library,, where, materials, are, expected, and, intended, to, be, loaned, to, patrons,, institutions,, or, other, libraries,, and, a, reference, library, where, material, is, not, lent, out., Modern, libraries, are, often, a, mixture, of, both,, containing, a, general, collection, for, circulation,, and, a, reference, collection, which, is, restricted, to, the, library, premises., Also,, increasingly,, digital, collections, enable, broader, access, to, material, that, may, not, circulate, in, print,, and, enables, libraries, to, expand, their, collections, even, without, building, a, larger, facility., Academic, libraries[edit], Main, article:, Academic, library, The, round, reading, room, of, Maughan, Library,, the, main, university, library, of, King's, College, London, Academic, libraries, are, generally, located, on, college, and, university, campuses, and, primarily, serve, the, students, and, faculty, of, that, and, other, academic, institutions., Some, academic, libraries,, especially, those, at, public, institutions,, are, accessible, to, members, of, the, general, public, in, whole, or, in, part., The, University, Library, in, Budapest., Academic, libraries, are, libraries, that, are, hosted, in, post-secondary, educational, institutions,, such, as, colleges, and, universities., Their, main, function, are, to, provide, support, in, research, and, resource, linkage, for, students, and, faculty, of, the, educational, institution., Specific, course-related, resources, are, usually, provided, by, the, library,, such, as, copies, of, textbooks, and, article, readings, held, on, 'reserve', (meaning, that, they, are, loaned, out, only, on, a, short-term, basis,, usually, a, matter, of, hours)., Academic, libraries, offer, workshops, and, courses, outside, of, formal,, graded, coursework,, which, are, meant, to, provide, students, with, the, tools, necessary, to, succeed, in, their, programs.[116], These, workshops, may, include, help, with, citations,, effective, search, techniques,, journal, databases,, and, electronic, citation, software., These, workshops, provide, students, with, skills, that, can, help, them, achieve, success, in, their, academic, careers, (and, often,, in, their, future, occupations),, which, they, may, not, learn, inside, the, classroom., The, Robarts, Library, at, the, University, of, Toronto,, Canada., The, academic, library, provides, a, quiet, study, space, for, students, on, campus;, it, may, also, provide, group, study, space,, such, as, meeting, rooms., In, North, America,, Europe,, and, other, parts, of, the, world,, academic, libraries, are, becoming, increasingly, digitally, oriented., The, library, provides, a, "gateway", for, students, and, researchers, to, access, various, resources,, both, print/physical, and, digital.[117], Academic, institutions, are, subscribing, to, electronic, journals, databases,, providing, research, and, scholarly, writing, software,, and, usually, provide, computer, workstations, or, computer, labs, for, students, to, access, journals,, library, search, databases, and, portals,, institutional, electronic, resources,, Internet, access,, and, course-, or, task-related, software, (i.e., word, processing, and, spreadsheet, software)., They, are, increasingly, acting, as, an, electronic, repository, for, institutional, scholarly, research, and, academic, knowledge,, such, as, the, collection, and, curation, of, digital, copies, of, students', theses, and, dissertations.[118][119], Children's, libraries[edit], A, children's, library, in, Montreal,, Canada, in, 1943, Children's, libraries, are, special, collections, of, books, intended, for, juvenile, readers, and, usually, kept, in, separate, rooms, of, general, public, libraries., Some, children's, libraries, have, entire, floors, or, wings, dedicated, to, them, in, bigger, libraries, while, smaller, ones, may, have, a, separate, room, or, area, for, children., They, are, an, educational, agency, seeking, to, acquaint, the, young, with, the, world's, literature, and, to, cultivate, a, love, for, reading., Their, work, supplements, that, of, the, public, schools.[120], Services, commonly, provided, by, public, libraries, may, include, storytelling, sessions, for, infants,, toddlers,, preschool, children,, or, after-school, programs,, all, with, an, intention, of, developing, early, literacy, skills, and, a, love, of, books., One, of, the, most, popular, programs, offered, in, public, libraries, are, summer, reading, programs, for, children,, families,, and, adults.[121], Another, popular, reading, program, for, children, is, PAWS, TO, READ, or, similar, programs, where, children, can, read, to, certified, therapy, dogs., Since, animals, are, a, calming, influence, and, there, is, no, judgment,, children, learn, confidence, and, a, love, of, reading., Many, states, have, these, types, of, programs, parents, just, have, to, ask, their, librarian, to, see, if, it, is, available, at, their, local, library.[122], National, libraries[edit], National, Library, of, Wales, Main, article:, National, library, A, national, or, state, library, serves, as, a, national, repository, of, information,, and, has, the, right, of, legal, deposit,, which, is, a, legal, requirement, that, publishers, in, the, country, need, to, deposit, a, copy, of, each, publication, with, the, library., Unlike, a, public, library,, a, national, library, rarely, allows, citizens, to, borrow, books., Often,, their, collections, include, numerous, rare,, valuable,, or, significant, works., There, are, wider, definitions, of, a, national, library,, putting, less, emphasis, on, the, repository, character.[123][124], The, first, national, libraries, had, their, origins, in, the, royal, collections, of, the, sovereign, or, some, other, supreme, body, of, the, state., Many, national, libraries, cooperate, within, the, National, Libraries, Section, of, the, International, Federation, of, Library, Associations, and, Institutions, (IFLA), to, discuss, their, common, tasks,, define, and, promote, common, standards,, and, carry, out, projects, helping, them, to, fulfil, their, duties., The, national, libraries, of, Europe, participate, in, The, European, Library, which, is, a, service, of, the, Conference, of, European, National, Librarians, (CENL)., Public, lending, libraries[edit], Main, article:, Public, library, Raczyński, Library,, the, public, library, of, Poznań,, Poland, A, public, library, provides, services, to, the, general, public., If, the, library, is, part, of, a, countywide, library, system,, citizens, with, an, active, library, card, from, around, that, county, can, use, the, library, branches, associated, with, the, library, system., A, library, can, serve, only, their, city,, however,, if, they, are, not, a, member, of, the, county, public, library, system., Much, of, the, materials, located, within, a, public, library, are, available, for, borrowing., The, library, staff, decides, upon, the, number, of, items, patrons, are, allowed, to, borrow,, as, well, as, the, details, of, borrowing, time, allotted., Typically,, libraries, issue, library, cards, to, community, members, wishing, to, borrow, books., Often, visitors, to, a, city, are, able, to, obtain, a, public, library, card., Many, public, libraries, also, serve, as, community, organizations, that, provide, free, services, and, events, to, the, public,, such, as, reading, groups, and, toddler, story, time., For, many, communities,, the, library, is, a, source, of, connection, to, a, vast, world,, obtainable, knowledge, and, understanding,, and, entertainment., According, to, a, study, by, the, Pennsylvania, Library, Association,, public, library, services, play, a, major, role, in, fighting, rising, illiteracy, rates, among, youths.[125], Public, libraries, are, protected, and, funded, by, the, public, they, serve., As, the, number, of, books, in, libraries, have, steadily, increased, since, their, inception,, the, need, for, compact, storage, and, access, with, adequate, lighting, has, grown., The, stack, system, involves, keeping, a, library's, collection, of, books, in, a, space, separate, from, the, reading, room., This, arrangement, arose, in, the, 19th, century., Book, stacks, quickly, evolved, into, a, fairly, standard, form, in, which, the, cast, iron, and, steel, frameworks, supporting, the, bookshelves, also, supported, the, floors,, which, often, were, built, of, translucent, blocks, to, permit, the, passage, of, light, (but, were, not, transparent,, for, reasons, of, modesty)., The, introduction, of, electrical, lighting, had, a, huge, impact, on, how, the, library, operated., The, use, of, glass, floors, was, largely, discontinued,, though, floors, were, still, often, composed, of, metal, grating, to, allow, air, to, circulate, in, multi-story, stacks., As, more, space, was, needed,, a, method, of, moving, shelves, on, tracks, (compact, shelving), was, introduced, to, cut, down, on, otherwise, wasted, aisle, space., A, community, library, in, Ethiopia., Library, 2.0,, a, term, coined, in, 2005,, is, the, library's, response, to, the, challenge, of, Google, and, an, attempt, to, meet, the, changing, needs, of, users, by, using, web, 2.0, technology., Some, of, the, aspects, of, Library, 2.0, include,, commenting,, tagging,, bookmarking,, discussions,, use, of, online, social, networks, by, libraries,, plug-ins,, and, widgets.[126], Inspired, by, web, 2.0,, it, is, an, attempt, to, make, the, library, a, more, user-driven, institution., Despite, the, importance, of, public, libraries,, they, are, routinely, having, their, budgets, cut, by, state, legislature., Funding, has, dwindled, so, badly, that, many, public, libraries, have, been, forced, to, cut, their, hours, and, release, employees.[127], Poet, Laureate, Rita, Dove's, definition, of, a, library, at, entrance, to, the, Maine, State, Library, in, Augusta,, Maine, Reference, libraries[edit], A, reference, library, does, not, lend, books, and, other, items;, instead,, they, must, be, read, at, the, library, itself., Typically,, such, libraries, are, used, for, research, purposes,, for, example, at, a, university., Some, items, at, reference, libraries, may, be, historical, and, even, unique., Many, lending, libraries, contain, a, "reference, section",, which, holds, books,, such, as, dictionaries,, which, are, common, reference, books,, and, are, therefore, not, lent, out.[128], Such, reference, sections, may, be, referred, to, as, "reading, rooms",, which, may, also, include, newspapers, and, periodicals.[129], An, example, of, a, reading, room, is, the, Hazel, H., Ransom, Reading, Room, at, the, Harry, Ransom, Center, of, the, University, of, Texas, at, Austin,, which, maintains, the, papers, of, literary, agent, Audrey, Wood.[130], Quaid-e-Azam, Library, in, Bagh-e-Jinnah,, Lahore,, Pakistan, Research, libraries[edit], A, research, library, is, a, collection, of, materials, on, one, or, more, subjects.[131], A, research, library, supports, scholarly, or, scientific, research, and, will, generally, include, primary, as, well, as, secondary, sources;, it, will, maintain, permanent, collections, and, attempt, to, provide, access, to, all, necessary, materials., A, research, library, is, most, often, an, academic, or, national, library,, but, a, large, special, library, may, have, a, research, library, within, its, special, field,, and, a, very, few, of, the, largest, public, libraries, also, serve, as, research, libraries., A, large, university, library, may, be, considered, a, research, library;, and, in, North, America,, such, libraries, may, belong, to, the, Association, of, Research, Libraries.[132], In, the, United, Kingdom,, they, may, be, members, of, Research, Libraries, UK, (RLUK).[133], A, research, library, can, be, either, a, reference, library,, which, does, not, lend, its, holdings,, or, a, lending, library,, which, does, lend, all, or, some, of, its, holdings., Some, extremely, large, or, traditional, research, libraries, are, entirely, reference, in, this, sense,, lending, none, of, their, materials;, most, academic, research, libraries,, at, least, in, the, US, and, the, UK,, now, lend, books,, but, not, periodicals, or, other, materials., Many, research, libraries, are, attached, to, a, parental, organization, and, serve, only, members, of, that, organization., Examples, of, research, libraries, include, the, British, Library,, the, Bodleian, Library, at, Oxford, University, and, the, New, York, Public, Library, Main, Branch, on, 42nd, Street, in, Manhattan,, State, Public, Scientific, Technological, Library, of, the, Sibirian, Branch, of, the, Russian, Academy, of, Science.[134][135], Special, libraries[edit], Main, article:, Special, library, Technology, Tower,, Library, in, VIT, University,, India, All, other, libraries,, including, digital, libraries,, fall, into, the, "special, library", category., Many, private, businesses, and, public, organizations,, including, hospitals,, churches,, museums,, research, laboratories,, law, firms,, and, many, government, departments, and, agencies,, maintain, their, own, libraries, for, the, use, of, their, employees, in, doing, specialized, research, related, to, their, work., Depending, on, the, particular, institution,, special, libraries, may, or, may, not, be, accessible, to, the, general, public, or, elements, thereof., In, more, specialized, institutions, such, as, law, firms, and, research, laboratories,, librarians, employed, in, special, libraries, are, commonly, specialists, in, the, institution's, field, rather, than, generally, trained, librarians,, and, often, are, not, required, to, have, advanced, degrees, in, specifically, library-related, field, due, to, the, specialized, content, and, clientele, of, the, library., Some, special, libraries,, such, as, governmental, law, libraries,, hospital, libraries,, and, military, base, libraries, commonly, are, open, to, public, visitors, to, the, institution, in, question., Depending, on, the, particular, library, and, the, clientele, it, serves,, special, libraries, may, offer, services, similar, to, research,, reference,, public,, academic,, or, children's, libraries,, often, with, restrictions, such, as, only, lending, books, to, patients, at, a, hospital, or, restricting, the, public, from, parts, of, a, military, collection., Given, the, highly, individual, nature, of, special, libraries,, visitors, to, a, special, library, are, often, advised, to, check, what, services, and, restrictions, apply, at, that, particular, library., Special, libraries, are, distinguished, from, special, collections,, which, are, branches, or, parts, of, a, library, intended, for, rare, books,, manuscripts,, and, other, special, materials,, though, some, special, libraries, have, special, collections, of, their, own,, typically, related,

sometimes, complained, that, some, of, the, library, buildings, which, have, been, used, to, accommodate, libraries, have, been, inadequate, for, the, demands, made, upon, them., In, general,, this, condition, may, have, resulted, from, one, or, more, of, the, following, causes:, an, effort, to, erect, a, monumental, building[vague];, most, of, those, who, commission, library, buildings, are, not, librarians, and, their, priorities, may, be, different, to, conform, it, to, a, type, of, architecture, unsuited, to, library, purposes, the, appointment,, often, by, competition,, of, an, architect, unschooled, in, the, requirements, of, a, library, failure, to, consult, with, the, librarian, or, with, library, experts, Much, advancement, has, undoubtedly, been, made, toward, cooperation, between, architect, and, librarian,[when?], and, many, good, designers, have, made, library, buildings, their, speciality,, nevertheless, it, seems, that, the, ideal, type, of, library, is, not, yet, realized—the, type, so, adapted, to, its, purpose, that, it, would, be, immediately, recognized, as, such,, as, is, the, case, with, school, buildings, at, the, present, time.[when?], This, does, not, mean, that, library, constructions, should, conform, rigidly, to, a, fixed, standard, of, appearance, and, arrangement,, but, it, does, mean, that, the, exterior, should, express, as, nearly, as, possible, the, purpose, and, functions, of, the, interior.[98], Usage[edit], This, section, needs, additional, citations, for, verification., Please, help, improve, this, article, by, adding, citations, to, reliable, sources., Unsourced, material, may, be, challenged, and, removed., (March, 2012), (Learn, how, and, when, to, remove, this, template, message), Until, the, advent, of, digital, catalogues,, card, catalogues, were, the, traditional, method, of, organizing, the, list, of, resources, and, their, location, within, a, large, library, Dynix, was, an, early,, but, long-lasting, and, popular,, digital, catalogue., Patrons, may, not, know, how, to, fully, use, the, library's, resources., This, can, be, due, to, some, individuals', unease, in, approaching, a, staff, member., Ways, in, which, a, library's, content, is, displayed, or, accessed, may, have, the, most, impact, on, use., An, antiquated, or, clumsy, search, system,, or, staff, unwilling, or, untrained, to, engage, their, patrons,, will, limit, a, library's, usefulness., In, the, public, libraries, of, the, United, States,, beginning, in, the, 19th, century,, these, problems, drove, the, emergence, of, the, library, instruction, movement,, which, advocated, library, user, education.[140], One, of, the, early, leaders, was, John, Cotton, Dana.[141], The, basic, form, of, library, instruction, is, sometimes, known, as, information, literacy.[142], Libraries, should, inform, their, users, of, what, materials, are, available, in, their, collections, and, how, to, access, that, information., Before, the, computer, age,, this, was, accomplished, by, the, card, catalogue—a, cabinet, (or, multiple, cabinets), containing, many, drawers, filled, with, index, cards, that, identified, books, and, other, materials., In, a, large, library,, the, card, catalogue, often, filled, a, large, room., The, emergence, of, the, Internet,, however,, has, led, to, the, adoption, of, electronic, catalogue, databases, (often, referred, to, as, "webcats", or, as, online, public, access, catalogues,, OPACs),, which, allow, users, to, search, the, library's, holdings, from, any, location, with, Internet, access.[143], This, style, of, catalogue, maintenance, is, compatible, with, new, types, of, libraries,, such, as, digital, libraries, and, distributed, libraries,, as, well, as, older, libraries, that, have, been, retrofitted., Electronic, catalogue, databases, are, criticized, by, some, who, believe, that, the, old, card, catalogue, system, was, both, easier, to, navigate, and, allowed, retention, of, information,, by, writing, directly, on, the, cards,, that, is, lost, in, the, electronic, systems.[144], This, argument, is, analogous, to, the, debate, over, paper, books, and, e-books., While, libraries, have, been, accused, of, precipitously, throwing, out, valuable, information, in, card, catalogues,, most, modern, ones, have, nonetheless, made, the, move, to, electronic, catalogue, databases., Large, libraries, may, be, scattered, within, multiple, buildings, across, a, town,, each, having, multiple, floors,, with, multiple, rooms, housing, the, resources, across, a, series, of, shelves., Once, a, user, has, located, a, resource, within, the, catalogue,, they, must, then, use, navigational, guidance, to, retrieve, the, resource, physically;, a, process, that, may, be, assisted, through, signage,, maps,, GPS, systems,, or, RFID, tagging., Finland, has, the, highest, number, of, registered, book, borrowers, per, capita, in, the, world., Over, half, of, Finland's, population, are, registered, borrowers.[145], In, the, US,, public, library, users, have, borrowed, on, average, roughly, 15, books, per, user, per, year, from, 1856, to, 1978., From, 1978, to, 2004,, book, circulation, per, user, declined, approximately, 50%., The, growth, of, audiovisuals, circulation,, estimated, at, 25%, of, total, circulation, in, 2004,, accounts, for, about, half, of, this, decline.[146], Shift, to, digital, libraries[edit], See, also:, Digital, library, Interior, of, the, Bibliotheca, Alexandrina,, Alexandria,, Egypt,, showing, both, stacks, and, computer, terminals, In, the, 21st, century,, there, has, been, increasing, use, of, the, Internet, to, gather, and, retrieve, data., The, shift, to, digital, libraries, has, greatly, impacted, the, way, people, use, physical, libraries., Between, 2002, and, 2004,, the, average, American, academic, library, saw, the, overall, number, of, transactions, decline, approximately, 2.2%.[147], Libraries, are, trying, to, keep, up, with, the, digital, world, and, the, new, generation, of, students, that, are, used, to, having, information, just, one, click, away., For, example,, the, University, of, California, Library, System, saw, a, 54%, decline, in, circulation, between, 1991, and, 2001, of, 8,377,000, books, to, 3,832,000.[148], These, facts, might, be, a, consequence, of, the, increased, availability, of, e-resources., In, 1999–2000,, 105, ARL, university, libraries, spent, almost, $100, million, on, electronic, resources,, which, is, an, increase, of, nearly, $23, million, from, the, previous, year.[149], A, 2003, report, by, the, Open, E-book, Forum, found, that, close, to, a, million, e-books, had, been, sold, in, 2002,, generating, nearly, $8, million, in, revenue.[150], Another, example, of, the, shift, to, digital, libraries, can, be, seen, in, Cushing, Academy’s, decision, to, dispense, with, its, library, of, printed, books—more, than, 20,000, volumes, in, all—and, switch, over, entirely, to, digital, media, resources.[151], Stacks, of, the, José, Vasconcelos, Library, in, Mexico, City, One, claim, to, why, there, is, a, decrease, in, the, usage, of, libraries, stems, from, the, observation, of, the, research, habits, of, undergraduate, students, enrolled, in, colleges, and, universities., There, have, been, claims, that, college, undergraduates, have, become, more, used, to, retrieving, information, from, the, Internet, than, a, traditional, library., As, each, generation, becomes, more, in, tune, with, the, Internet,, their, desire, to, retrieve, information, as, quickly, and, easily, as, possible, has, increased., Finding, information, by, simply, searching, the, Internet, could, be, much, easier, and, faster, than, reading, an, entire, book., In, a, survey, conducted, by, NetLibrary,, 93%, of, undergraduate, students, claimed, that, finding, information, online, makes, more, sense, to, them, than, going, to, the, library., Also,, 75%, of, students, surveyed, claimed, that, they, did, not, have, enough, time, to, go, to, the, library, and, that, they, liked, the, convenience, of, the, Internet., While, the, retrieving, information, from, the, Internet, may, be, efficient, and, time, saving, than, visiting, a, traditional, library,, research, has, shown, that, undergraduates, are, most, likely, searching, only, .03%, of, the, entire, web.[152], The, information, that, they, are, finding, might, be, easy, to, retrieve, and, more, readily, available,, but, may, not, be, as, in, depth, as, information, from, other, resources, such, as, the, books, available, at, a, physical, library., In, the, mid-2000s,, Swedish, company, Distec, invented, a, library, book, vending, machine, known, as, the, GoLibrary,, that, offers, library, books, to, people, where, there, is, no, branch,, limited, hours,, or, high, traffic, locations, such, as, El, Cerrito, del, Norte, BART, station, in, California., The, Internet[edit], British, Museum, Reading, Room, A, library, may, make, use, of, the, Internet, in, a, number, of, ways,, from, creating, their, own, library, website, to, making, the, contents, of, its, catalogues, searchable, online., Some, specialised, search, engines, such, as, Google, Scholar, offer, a, way, to, facilitate, searching, for, academic, resources, such, as, journal, articles, and, research, papers., The, Online, Computer, Library, Center, allows, library, records, to, be, searched, online, through, its, WorldCat, database.[153], Websites, such, as, LibraryThing, and, Amazon, provide, abstracts,, reviews,, and, recommendations, of, books.[153], Libraries, provide, computers, and, Internet, access, to, allow, people, to, search, for, information, online.[154], Online, information, access, is, particularly, attractive, to, younger, library, users.[155][156][157][158], Digitization, of, books,, particularly, those, that, are, out-of-print,, in, projects, such, as, Google, Books, provides, resources, for, library, and, other, online, users., Due, to, their, holdings, of, valuable, material,, some, libraries, are, important, partners, for, search, engines, such, as, Google, in, realizing, the, potential, of, such, projects, and, have, received, reciprocal, benefits, in, cases, where, they, have, negotiated, effectively.[159], As, the, prominence, of, and, reliance, on, the, Internet, has, grown,, library, services, have, moved, the, emphasis, from, mainly, providing, print, resources, to, providing, more, computers, and, more, Internet, access.[160], Libraries, face, a, number, of, challenges, in, adapting, to, new, ways, of, information, seeking, that, may, stress, convenience, over, quality,[161], reducing, the, priority, of, information, literacy, skills.[162], The, potential, decline, in, library, usage,, particularly, reference, services,[163], puts, the, necessity, for, these, services, in, doubt., Library, scholars, have, acknowledged, that, libraries, need, to, address, the, ways, that, they, market, their, services, if, they, are, to, compete, with, the, Internet, and, mitigate, the, risk, of, losing, users.[164], This, includes, promoting, the, information, literacy, skills, training, considered, vital, across, the, library, profession.[162][165][166], However,, marketing, of, services, has, to, be, adequately, supported, financially, in, order, to, be, successful., This, can, be, problematic, for, library, services, that, are, publicly, funded, and, find, it, difficult, to, justify, diverting, tight, funds, to, apparently, peripheral, areas, such, as, branding, and, marketing.[167], The, privacy, aspect, of, library, usage, in, the, Internet, age, is, a, matter, of, growing, concern, and, advocacy;, privacy, workshops, are, run, by, the, Library, Freedom, Project, which, teach, librarians, about, digital, tools, (such, as, the, Tor, Project), to, thwart, mass, surveillance.[168][169][170], Associations[edit], See, also:, List, of, library, associations, The, International, Federation, of, Library, Associations, and, Institutions, (IFLA), is, the, leading, international, association, of, library, organisations., It, is, the, global, voice, of, the, library, and, information, profession,, and, its, annual, conference, provides, a, venue, for, librarians, to, learn, from, one, another.[171], Library, associations, in, Asia, include, the, Indian, Library, Association, (ILA),[172], Indian, Association, of, Special, Libraries, and, Information, Centers, (IASLIC),[173], Bengal, Library, Association, (BLA),, Kolkata,[174], Pakistan, Library, Association,[175], the, Pakistan, Librarians, Welfare, Organization,[176], the, Bangladesh, Association, of, Librarians,, Information, Scientists, and, Documentalists,, the, Library, Association, of, Bangladesh,, and, the, Sri, Lanka, Library, Association, (founded, 1960)., National, associations, of, the, English-speaking, world, include, the, American, Library, Association,, the, Australian, Library, and, Information, Association,, the, Canadian, Library, Association,, and, the, Research, Libraries, UK, (a, consortium, of, 30, university, and, other, research, libraries, in, the, United, Kingdom)., Library, bodies, such, as, CILIP, (formerly, the, Library, Association,, founded, 1877), may, advocate, the, role, that, libraries, and, librarians, can, play, in, a, modern, Internet, environment,, and, in, the, teaching, of, information, literacy, skills.[165][177], Public, library, advocacy, is, support, given, to, a, public, library, for, its, financial, and, philosophical, goals, or, needs., Most, often, this, takes, the, form, of, monetary, or, material, donations, or, campaigning, to, the, institutions, which, oversee, the, library,, sometimes, by, advocacy, groups, such, as, Friends, of, Libraries, and, community, members., Originally,, library, advocacy, was, centered, on, the, library, itself,, but, current, trends, show, libraries, positioning, themselves, to, demonstrate, they, provide, "economic, value, to, the, community", in, means, that, are, not, directly, related, to, the, checking, out, of, books, and, other, media.[178], See, also[edit], Library, and, information, science, portal, Education, portal, Culture, portal, Chinese, Library,

of, books,, and, their, vast, libraries, attracted, scholars, of, every, creed, from, far, and, wide., The, Imam, al-Hakim, even, provided, ink,, pens,, paper,, and, inkstands, free, of, charge, for,
