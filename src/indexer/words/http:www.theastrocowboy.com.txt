soar,, and, so, will, theirs,, and, so, will, we, all, soar., If, you, would, like, to, communicate, with, Kay, Farmer, or, if, you, have, any, stories, or, remembrances, to, share, please, e-mail, or, call, her, at, 307-733-2173., Walt's, memorial, and, wishes., Walt's, book,, "Wyoming,, A, History, of, Film, and, Video, in, the, 20th, Century", will, continue, to, be, sold, from, this, site, and, at, the, Jackson, Hole, Museum, Store.,      , My, name, is, Walt, Farmer,, I, live, in, Jackson,, WY,, and, my, website, is, primarily, dedicated, to, the, 20th, Century, of, film, in, Wyoming, and, the, books, I've, written., On, it,, you, are, able, to, reference, the, complete, list, of, films,, TV, shows,, documentaries,, and, other, misc., information, about, this, rich, history., There, are, many, photographic, illustrations, and, other, peripheral, information,, along, with, links, to, various, other, Wyoming/film, sites., Besides, the, above, information,, the, book, mostly, relates, behind, the, scenes, stories, of, how, these, films, were, accomplished,, locations,, and, what, the, principals, did, while, visiting, Wyoming., The, book, has, extensive, interviews, with, the, stars,, directors,, cinematographers,, extras,, locals, and, others, responsible, for, the, production, of, these, films., I, was, also, featured, in, the, Japanese, magazine, Rakuda,, in, their, Aug./Sept., 2007, issue,, as, part, of, a, larger, article, about, western, films, in, the, U.S., Very, nice, article,, but, you, need, to, be, able, to, read, Japanese., Here's, a, scanned, excerpt., On, the, link,, move, down, the, page, about, 1/3, to, the, article.,       , Stories, such, as, who, got, hurt, during, filming, of, a, number, of, movies;, the, weekly, brawls, during, making, of, The, Big, Sky;, why, George, Stevens, chose, Jackson, Hole, to, film, Shane, and, who, else, were, considered, for, the, principal, roles;, how, Starship, Troopers, came, to, fruition, and, why, the, producer, and, his, military, advisor, were, at, odds;, why, Marjorie, Main, always, wore, white, gloves;, where, the, fortress, door, in, Mrs., Pollifax-Spy, really, came, from;, or, what, really, happened, to, all, the, "dead", animals, in, Close, Encounters, of, the, Third, Kind., The, stories, are, almost, endless,, whether, through, interviews, or, other, historical, accounts. As, a, result,, I, had, hoped, to, get, a, publisher, for, this, comprehensive, book,"Wyoming,, A, History, of, Film, and, Video, in, the, 20th, Century"©, ,, but, they, weren't, especially, interested,, the, dolts. , So,, in, 2001,, I, authored, the, book , onto, CD-ROM, which, is, much, more, comprehensive, than, a, paper, book, could, ever, be, &, a, lot, cheaper, as, well, and, have, published, it, myself., As, of, 9.22.00,, I, finished, my, first, edition, of, the, cdrombook, titled,, The, Making, of, Shane©,, and, you, can, get, specific, information, about, it, by, clicking, on, the, link, to, the, left. , You, can, email, me, by, clicking, on, the, elk. , Both, have, been, updated, considerably, since, &, are, quite, large, due, to, all, the, research, info, &, images, in, each.,    , I, also, wrote, a, small, book, several, years, ago, titled,, "Shootout, on, the, Town, Square:, The, Story, of, the, Jackson, Hole, Shootout"©., It's, the, oldest, continuous, running, show, of, its, kind, in, the, country,, which, I, performed, in, and, managed, for, a, number, of, years., Click, on, the, Elk, and, email, me, for, a, copy,, $7.50, including, postage.,    , TOURS, to, movie, locations, in, the, Jackson, Hole, area?, While, the, most, well, known, is, Shane,, there, were, over, 30, films, made, here, either, all, or, in, part,, that, provide, a, considerable, portion, of, the, history, of, filmmaking, in, Wyoming., Some, are, still, in, the, backcountry,, but, most, are, easily, accessed., From, sci-fi, to, westerns,, from, the, supernatural, to, some, real, bombs,, this, is, an, homage, to, Wyoming. , Contact, me, for, information, about, a, movie, or, click, on, the, link, above,, or, if, you, have, need, of, a, location, scout.,    , I, am, the, founder, and, a, current, officer, of, the, Jackson, (Hole), Astronomy, Club. , Annually, in, August,, we, "observe", National, Astronomy, Day, at, Colter, Bay, in, Grand, Teton, National, Park. , Go, to, the, webpage, above, &, find, out, when, it, will, be, for, this, year. , And,, I, wrote, a, monthly, column, on, astronomy, for, the, JH, News, for, the, last, 5, yrs., until, Feb., of, 2003. , Since, then, I, wrote, a, column, for, Planet, Jackson, Hole, which, ended, in, April, of, '05.  , Just, click, on, the, elk, above, left, &, email, me, with, any, questions. , Ever, had, any, astronomical,

March, 2008, as, KHOL, at, 89.1, FM., I, started, helping, with, a, noontime, Latin, program, on, Tues., &, Thurs., on, 4/24,, which, we, subsequently, dropped. , I, then, did, an, international, program, (Walt's, World, Music, from, Wyoming-WWMW), every, Sunday, from, 2-4pm, which, has, also, been, dropped. , Then,, I, did, a, show, of, big, band, music, on, Sundays, from, 10am, to, noon. , Music, from, the, 30s,, 40s, &, later,, WWII, era,, that, remember, &, salute, a, style, of, music, not, heard, much, anymore, &, in, very, few, places,, now, including,, Jackson,, WY. , However,, due, to, health, issues,, I've, had, to, stop, that, show, as, well,, but, it, was, a, great, show,, as, 2013,, is, the, 50th, year, I've, been, doing, some, form, of, radio, program, or, another. , Maybe,, things, will, get, better, &, I, can, do, it, again. , We, hope, to, stream, on, the, net, soon, as, well,, so, you, can, get, Jackson, information, around, the, globe. , I, also, did, programs, of, pop,, classic, rock,, &, tributes, on, Memorial, &, Veterans, Days. , Would, you, like, to, own, www.kjxn.org? , I, own, this, domain, name,, for, more, info,, click, HERE.,   , In,

format. , Check, this, LINK, for, expanded, information.,    , Lastly? , I'm, also, a, cowboy, poet, of, sorts, although, I, don't, perform, any, more, due, to, health, problems,, but, it's, been,
