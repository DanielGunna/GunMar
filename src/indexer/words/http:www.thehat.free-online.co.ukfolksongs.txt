[Phil's, Folk, Singing, Page, I, think, I, first, discovered, that, I, was, interested, in, folk, music, when, I, started, looking, around, for, new, songs, to, sing, when, we, went, to, the, pub, after, a, Sealed, Knot, battle., Of, course, I, had, been, interested, in, folk, music, before, then,, I, just, didn't, realise, it., Like, everyone, else,, of, course,, we, sang, folk, songs, at, school,, although, the, only, one, in, particular, that, I, can, remember, (apart, from, Nursery, Rhymes), is, 'The, Lincolnshire, Poacher'., I, also, remember, singing, songs, with, my, Dad, (and, my, sister), when, going, on, long, car, journeys,, either, on, holiday,, or, to, visit, family, in, Gloucester., I, don't, know, why, we, never, sang, at, other, times,, but, I, guess, I, grew, up, thinking, that, these, sort, of, songs, were, for, when, you, were, in, the, car., I, still, sing, in, the, car,, but, usually, when, I, am, on, my, own,, on, the, way, to/from, work., The, songs, I, remember, singing, with, my, Dad, (and, I, still, remember, all, the, words), were:, Ilkley, Moor, (Bar, t'at), Barley, Malt, (version, of, The, Barley, Mow), The, court, of, King, Caractacus, Green, Grow, The, Rushes-O, The, Quartermaster's, Stores, I, also, remember, my, Dad, singing, 'My, old, Man's, A, Dustman',, and, a, version, of, 'The, Twelve, Days, Of, Christmas', which, had, the, hero, deliving, items, such, as, washing, machines,, instead, of, the, usual, turtle-doves,, french-hens, etc..., Anyway,, back, to, The, Sealed, Knot., I, joined, in, 1991, and, on, a, muster, weekend, we, would, generally, all, go, to, one, of, the, local, pubs, and, have, a, bloody, good,, boisterous,, sing-song., There, were, a, couple, of, songs, related, to, The, Civil, War,, but, mostly, they, were, general, folk, songs., Here, are, a, few, that, I, remember, that, we, used, to, sing, a, lot, (and, I, still, know, all, the, words):, The, Wild, Rover, Come, Landlord, Fill, The, Flowing, Bowl, The, Battle, of, Roundaway, Down, Why, Soldier, Why, A-Roving, (In, Amsterdam, there, lived, a, maid...), 1642, There, were, a, couple, of, others,, which, I, can't, remember, all, the, words, to, such, as, We, Are, The, King's, Lifeguard, (to, the, tune, -, Those, Were, The, Days), When, Cannons, Are, Roaring, (there, seemed, to, be, lots, of, different, versions, so, I, never, got, around, to, learning, it, properly., It's, a, shame, as, it, is, a, very, good, song), I, loved, singing, these, songs,, especially, when, we, had, a, big, group, of, us,, and, most, of, us, knew, the, words., Other, people, had, their, own, songs, too,, especially, Mark, Kent, who, knew, loads, of, stuff., I, decided, to, try, to, find, some, new, songs, to, sing,, and, this, is, how, I, discovered, Folk, Music., The, first, folk, club,, I, ever, went, to, was, The, Old, Pack, Horse, in, Loughborough., I, can't, remember, how, I, found, out, about, it,, probably, through, the, library., I, went, along, with, Mark, Kent,, and, if, I, recall, correctly, I, sang, 'I'll, Be, Hanged', (which, I, learned, from, a, Rolf, Harris, record), and, something, else, (can't, remember,, sorry)., I, think, Mark, sang, 'The, Keeper'., I, remember, being, very, nervous,, but, quite, pleased, with, myself., Singing, in, a, folk, club,, especially, one, like, The, Pack, Horse,, where, everyone, keeps, quiet, while, you, perform,, is, very, different, from, a, drunken, Sealed, Knot, Sing-song, where, you, are, with, all, your, mates., I, soon, became, a, regular, at, The, Pack, Horse,, and, I, also, started, going, to, other, folk, clubs., In, particular, King, William, IV, in, Thurcaston, on, a, Sunday, night., The, atmosphere, here, was, very, different, to, The, Pack, Horse, being, more, of, a, session, where, everyone, joins, in,, although, it, would, still, (usually), go, quiet, if, I, sang, a, ballad., One, of, the, first, ballads, I, learned, to, sing, was, 'The, Unquiet, Grave', which, I, learned, off, a, Dubliners, record., It, was, also, around, this, time, that, I, started, learning, the, tin, whistle, and, then, later, the, concertina., It, was, at, The, King, Bill, where, I, met, people, like, Edward, Reeve,, Rose, Gorringe,, Bill, Morrison, &, John, MacDonald,, and, lots, of, other, local, characters., Bill, Morrison, also, ran, a, folk, club, at, The, Forest, Rock, in, Woodhouse, Eaves,, on, a, Tuesday, night,, and, I, soon, became, a, regular, here, too., After, Bill, emigrated, to, New, Zealand,, Dave, Gooder, and, I, took, over, running, the, club., We, kept, it, going, for, a, year, or, so,, but, unfortunately, we, weren't, getting, enough, people, coming, along,, and, reluctantly, after, a, couple, of, weeks, where, no-one, showed, up, we, packed, it, in., Back, to, The, Sealed, Knot,, around, this, time, I, met, John, Bradburn, who, also, played, tin, whistle,, and, various, other, instruments., We, started, getting, together, for, regular, music, practices, on, a, Thursday, night, in, Castle, Donington., Also, around, about, this, time,, I, discovered, that, a, friend, of, mine, from, work,, Martin, Wildig,, used, to, play, violin, when, he, was, at, school., Eventually, I, persuaded, him, to, get, it, out,, and, come, along, to, the, practice, sessions, with, John, on, Thursdays., Martin, was, a, much, better, musician, than, me,, and, picked, up, the, tunes, that, we, were, struggling, with, really, quickly., I, also, dragged, Martin, along, to, The, King, Bill, a, few, times, where, he, met, Edward, and, Rose, and, was, drafted, in, to, play, for, Anstey, Royale, Chalfont,, a, Ladies, Morris, dancing, team, which, Rose, danced, for, and, Edward, played, Melodeon., Edward, also, roped, Martin, and, I, in, to, join, his, band, called, The, Acme, Dance, Company., Anyway, back, to, the, singing., I, still, attend, a, number, of, local, folk, clubs,, but, not, as, often, or, regularly, as, I, used, to., To, be, continued..., Here, is, a, list, of, some, of, the, songs, I, sing,, in, no, particular, order., The, Great, Fish, Finger, Disaster, The, Unquiet, Grave, One, More, Round,
