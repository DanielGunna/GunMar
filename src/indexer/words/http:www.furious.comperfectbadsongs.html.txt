pretty, subjective, but, I, did, have, a, few, criteria, for, what, should, be, here., I, decided, to, include, a, song, if, it:, made, me, sick, without, even, listening, to, it, again, made, me, want, to, break, my, radio, made, my, stomach, turn, brought, out, violent, thoughts, of, hatred,, revenge,, etc., reminded, me, how, lame, the, radio, and, record, companies, are, could, make, me, want, to, break, my, stereo, would, make, me, leave, a, bar, or, club, if, they, started, playing, it, would, make, me, boo, a, band, who, started, playing, it, suspended, my, believe, in, a, divine, force, that, governs, the, universe, I'm, not, saying, that, there, weren't, ANY, good, songs, during, the, 70s, but, there, was, just, a, truck-load, of, waste, back, then., If, anybody's, stupid, enough, to, think, that, ALL, disco, sucks,, remember, that, it's, just, a, bastard, son, of, rhythm, &, blues, just, like, rock'n'roll, is-, so, they're, related,, see?, Also,, the, 1970's,
