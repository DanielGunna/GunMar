that, it, was,, um,, inspired, by, an, episode, of, the, TV, show, "The, Rebel", (Season, 1, Episode, 25, -, Fair, Game)., As, soon, as, this, news, broke,, people, started, asking, me, if, I, was, going, to, do, a, comparison, video, between, the, two, things., Not, being, that, handy, with, video, software, --, at, least, not, nearly, as, handy, as, a, lot, of, people, I, see, online, who, seem, to, have, some, strong, AfterEffects, skills., To, that, end,, I, was, waiting, for, someone, else, to, do, it, --, maybe, Jacob, T., Swinney?, --, to, put, something, together., While, I, think, that, this, could, be, better,, Geektoid, has, cut, together, something, that, juxtaposes, a, few, scenes, and, ideas., If, someone, doesn't, put, together, something, better, soon,, I'm, going, to, have, to, dive, headfirst, back, into, Sony, Vegas., Posted, by, Mike, White, at, 8:30, AM, No, comments:, Email, ThisBlogThis!Share, to, TwitterShare, to, FacebookShare, to, Pinterest, Labels:, Homage,, Tarantino, Sunday,, July, 17,, 2016, Obligatory, Ghostbusters, 2016, Review, Going, to, the, the, 2016, Ghostbusters, on, opening, weekend, was, something, of, a, point, of, pride, for, me, after, reading, all, of, the, "trollicious", comments, about, how, terrible, the, new, movie, would, be., After, having, written, my, thoughts, about, the, bizarre, anti-women, sentiments, of, too, many, fanboys, (disguised, as, "this, remake, will, ruin, my, childhood", whining),, I, felt, obligated, to, review, the, film, one, way, or, the, other, --, positive, or, negative, --, as, long, as, I, could, review, it, honestly., In, 2011,, director, Paul, Feig, struck, gold, with, the, comedy, hit, Bridesmaids., Since, then,, he's, made, three, additional, film, starring, Melissa, McCarthy, (Heat,, Spy,, and, Ghostbusters)., These, films,, penned, by, Katie, Dippold,, Paul, Feig,, or, a, combination, of, both,, all, seem, to, draw, from, the, same, well., There's, a, pattern, to, the, jokes, in, these, films, which, mixes, ribald, comments, with, a, seemingly, faddish, turn, wherein, characters, riff, a, series, of, allegedly, funny, lines, and,, rather, than, using, the, best, one,, several, of, them, are, strung, together, in, the, final, product., That, kind, of, "on, the, fly", humor, can, be, effective, but, it, has, to, be, honed, and, used, judiciously., At, times,, these, jokes, pile, on, to, one, another,, making, scenes, increasingly, funny., When, not, done, well,, however,, scenes, can, feel, clunky, and, each, additional, comment, makes, the, scene, clunkier., Unfortunately,, Ghostbusters, 2016, is, a, very, clunky, movie., The, film, re-teams, Bridesmaids, stars, Kristen, Wiig, and, Melissa, McCarthy, while, introducing, "Saturday, Night, Live", alumn, Kate, McKinnon, and, Leslie, Jones, to, the, mix., Wiig, as, Professor, Erin, Gilbert, is, our, protagonist, though, she, quickly, becomes, eclipsed, by, McCartney, as, Abby, Yates, and, McKinnon, as, Jillian, Holtzmann., Gilbert, and, Yates, bicker, like, the, former, friends, they, are, while, Holtzmann, embodies, some, kind, of, living, cartoon, character, --, appropriate, since, she, seems, styled, after, the, Egon, Spengler, on, the, animated, "The, Real, Ghostbusters"., This, presents, a, conundrum, as, Holtzmann, becomes, the, most, interesting, person, to, look, at, on, screen, but, she, never, gives, us, anything, but, an, out-of-step, lipsynching, scene, (where, she's, seemingly, seducing, Gilbert?), and, several, nonsequiters., She, may, be, brilliant, when, it, comes, to, making, ghost-catching, gadgets, but, she, doesn't, know, DeBarge, from, Devo., After, the, three, women, begin, a, business, to, investigate, the, paranormal,, they, hire, Kevin, (Chris, Hemsworth)., Dumb, as, a, box, of, rocks,, Kevin, is, a, one-note, character, whose, first, note, rings, flat, and, only, gets, worse, from, there., The, scene, of, him, showing, his, graphic, design, skills, might, be, one, of, the, most, excruciating, bits, of, the, film., We, eventually, meet, Patty, Tolan, (Leslie, Jones),, a, mass, transit, employee, who, manages, to, make, it, past, Kevin's, incompetence, and, summons, the, Ghostbusters, to, the, subway, for, their, second, supernatural, encounter., Apparently,, Patty, is, impressed, by, the, team's, incompetence, and, inexplicably, joins, them., This, is, one, of, many, "this, thing, needs, to, happen, so, it's, just, going, to, happen", moments, of, the, film., There, is, an, antagonist, in, Ghostbusters..., of, a, sort., Rowan, North,, played, by, Neil, Casey,, has, less, depth, and, backstory, than, a, "Criminal, Minds", freak, of, the, week., He's, such, a, thumbnail, sketch, that, I, kept, expecting, that, he, was, just, a, lowly, henchman, for, some, bigger, baddie, (like, Andy, Garcia's, Mayor, character, or,, even, better,, Cecily, Strong, as, Jennifer, Lynch,, the, Mayor's, assistant)., Alas,, no., The, film's, villain, remains, unmotivated, and, as, poorly, drawn, as, the, rest, of, the, characters, in, the, film., It, seems, that, the, real, bad, guy, of, the, film, is, Paul, Feig, who's, given, his, team, very, little, to, work, with., Additionally,, the, film, suffers, from, being, simply, poorly, made., The, most, glaring, example, of, this, comes, in, the, scene, after, the, team, gets, called, into, the, Mayor's, office, and, told, that, they, have, to, stop, their, ghost-busting, antics., This, cuts, to, the, team, in, an, alley, where, Yates, says, that, the, Mayor, is, allowing, them, to, continue, to, hunt, ghosts!?, The, scene, proceeds, to, exist, with, the, sole, purpose, to, demonstrate, a, few, weapons, that, will, be, used, in, the, final, confrontation, with, the, Oogie, Boogie, version, of, Rowan, North., There's, really, no, need, for, this, scene, as, the, audience, has, seen, Holtzmann, making, quantum, leaps, in, technology, throughout, the, film., The, film, then, cuts, to, what, was, the, next, natural, scene, after, the, Mayor's, office, scene, where, our, heroes, are, downtrodden,, not, the, elated, characters, we, saw, during, the, brief, weapons, try-out., This, same, kind, of, editing, and, pacing, issues, mar, much, of, the, film., Of, course,, the, film, takes, an, extra, beat, whenever, introducing, a, ham-handed, cameo, from, the, original, Ghost, Busters, cast, (the, Sigourney, Weaver, bit, just, feels, tacked, on,, because, it, is), but, then, one, of, the, film's, other, cameos,, Ozzy, Osbourne,, cuts, away, too, quickly, (after, a, terrible, laugh, line)., Other, pacing, problems, present, in, the, Ghostbusters, only, catching, one, ghost, before, the, final, confrontation,, the, inexplicable, absence, of, Gilbert, from, the, team, after, their, strange-but-brief, "victory", over, Rowan, North,, and, the, gaping, absence, of, the, dance, number, Kevin-as-Rowan, is, setting, up, the, police, for, (which, we, see, somewhat, in, the, credits)., I, won't, even, go, into, how, troubling, Leslie, Jones's, role, was, handled, in, her, "white, people, be, crazy", stereotype, into, which, her, character, was, cast., Again,, better, writing, and, judicious, editing, could, have, helped, her, character, just, as, it, could, have, helped, all, of, the, other, paper-thin, characters, in, this, overblown, film, wherein,, at, the, end, of, the, day,, it, didn't, matter, what, gender, the, actors, are, but, how, good, the, script, and, direction, need, to, be., Ghostbusters, 2016, is, not, the, worst, movie, I've, seen., It's, not, necessarily, a, terrible, movie., It, feels, like, there's, a, competent, film, hidden, beneath, the, incompetence, of, the, product, that, came, to, theaters., I, don't, think, that, a, fan, edit, will, help, the, movie, once, it, comes, out, on, home, video, as, that, can, pare, back, some, of, the, clumsiness, of, the, current, film, but, it, can't, do, anything, to, help, build, the, characters, into, something, more, than, the, synopsis, descriptions, they're, limited, to, on, screen., And,, by, the, way,, I, don't, think, it's, going, to, ruin, your, childhood., Posted, by, Mike, White, at, 10:48, PM, 2, comments:, Email, ThisBlogThis!Share, to, TwitterShare, to, FacebookShare, to, Pinterest, Labels:, Movie, Review, Wednesday,, June, 29,, 2016, The, Trouble, with, Ghosts, I've, written, a, bit, in, the, past, about, the, trouble, with, so-called, "fan, boys", and, women., When, the, piece, about, Lianne, Spiderbaby, came, out,, a, lot, of, males, didn't, get, angry, about, Ms., Spiderbaby's, plagiarism, as, much, as, her, being, a, woman, "writer", in, a, typically, male-dominated, field, (penning, genre, reviews)., The, acceptance, of, women, as, being, fans, of, and, participants, in, genre, films,, filmmaking,, and, fandom, has, only, gotten, worse, rather, than, better, with, major, flare-ups, around, events, such, as, "Gamergate", and, Sad, Puppies., This, same, anti-woman, sentiment, seems, to, be, the, undercurrent, of, the, backlash, against, the, 2016, remake, of, Ghost, Busters, which, reverses, gender, roles, of, our, five, main, characters, (Kate, McKinnon,, Melissa, McCarthy,, Kristen, Wiig,, Leslie, Jones,, and, Chris, Hemsworth)., Rather, than, being, forward, with, the, idea, that, a, female-lead, Ghost, Busters, is, anathema, to, "fan, boy", culture,, it's, easier, to, disguise, the, hatred, while, holding, up, the, mantle, of, fandom, and, originality., While, film, culture, is, beset, by, remakes,, sequels,, and, prequels,, too, many, male, fans, have, used, Ghost, Busters, as, the, rallying, point, to, decry, remakes, as, if, it, were, simply, a, bridge, too, far., Apparently, it's, no, big, deal, to, make, horrible, movies, out, of, geeky, TV, shows, like, "Transformers", or, "Jem, &, The, Holograms", but, Ghost, Busters, (1984), is, a, sacred, text., Can, I, remind, people, that, Ghostbusters, 2, was, absolute, garbage, and, one, of, the, two, (!), "Ghostbuster", cartoons, was, also, terrible., If, anything,, Ghostbusters, 2016, seems, to, be, cleverly, paying, homage, to, the, good, Ghostbusters, cartoon, --, "The, Real, Ghost, Busters", --, via, Kate, McKinnon's, wild, Egon, hair., That, said,, I, have, been, not-so-silently, lambasting, James, Rolfe, AKA, Angry, Video, Game, Nerd,, as, being, something, of, the, face, of, this, issue., That's, probably, not, fair, as, he's, not, overtly, come, out, to, say, that, he, has, a, problem, with, the, gender-reversal, of, Ghostbusters, 2016, but, he, has, been, very, vocal, in, his, dismissal, of, the, film, prior, to, its, release, via, a, video, he, made, for, Cinemassacre, titled, "Ghostbusters, 2016., No, Review., I, refuse.", Watching, this, video, is, painful, as, Mr., Rolfe, comes, off, as, a, whiny, little, prick., It, takes, him, five, and, a, half, minutes, to, state, to, his, fans, (the, audience, of, the, video), why, he, won't, be, reviewing, Ghost, Busters, 2016., He, does, this, without, vitriol, or, even, raising, his, voice, from, a, languid, librarian, pitch., There's, no, "koala, dropping", rant., No., Instead, it's, a, very, calm, discussion, of, how, there's, no, way, that, Ghostbusters, 2016, can, be, good, because:, It, uses, the, same, name, as, the, original, movie, It, forgets, about, the, old, characters, It, doesn't, pay, service, to, the, fans, Apparently,, all, of, those, things, can, be, judged, by, the, trailer, (which, is, one, of, the, most, disliked, trailers, in, YouTube, history)., Mr., Rolfe, goes, on, to, talk, about, good, examples, of, remakes/reboots/sequels, like, Star, Wars, VII, and, Star, Trek, XI, which, pass, the, torch, from, one, generation, to, another., "A, little, fan, service, goes, a, long, way,", he, says., How, does, Mr., Rolfe, know, that, there, won't, be, any, "fan, service", in, the, new, Ghost, Busters?, I, already, mentioned, Ms., McKinnon's, hair,, the, trailer, seems, to, show, a, few, familiar, characters, like, Slimer,, and, Sigourney, Weaver,, Annie, Potts,, and, Ernie, Hudson, make, appearances, in, the, new, film., I, suppose, it's, too, little, because, Harold, Ramis, (RIP),, Bill, Murray*,, and, Rick, Moranis, won't, be, in, the, film., It, seems, to, me, that,, if, anything,, Ghostbusters, 2016, is, going, to, have, too, much, fan, service, but, I, can't, be, sure, because, I, haven't, seen, the, movie, yet., *Bill, Murray, may, show, up, in, an, uncredited, cameo, as, he, did, in, at, least, one, other, film., I, think, Brad, Jones, does, a, terrific, job, of, recontextualizing, Mr., Rolfe's, video, by, taking, the, gender, politics, out, of, it, and, simply, pointing, out, the, absurdity, of, Mr., Rolfe's, arguments, against, the, remake/reboot/sequel, protest:, Again,, Mr., Rolfe, does, not, say, anything, untoward, against, women, or, that, the, idea, gender-swapping, is, a, cheap, gimmick., Instead,, he, seems, to, focus, more, on, the, idea, that, this, new, Ghost, Busters, will, sully, the, memory, of, his, love, of, the, original, series., As, someone, who, suffered, through, The, Phantom, Menace,, I, would, ask, him, to, get, a, grip., He, doesn't, know, what, pain, is., Does, Mr., Rolfe, sound, like, a, "whiny, man, baby", in, his, video?, He, doesn't, whine, but, he, comes, across, as, whiny, because, he, felt, the, need, to, even, bother, to, spend, the, time, to, make, the, video., Some, people, feel, that, he, had, to, address, his, fan, base, because, they, were, demanding, it., I, don't, buy, it., Isn't, it, enough, to, say, "That, movie, looks, bad., I'm, not, going, to, see, it."?, Mr., Rolfe, has, his, very, odd, reasons, for, not, watching, Ghostbusters, 2016, and, he, felt, the, necessity, to, get, on, his, YouTube, soap, box, for, five, and, a, half, minutes, to, talk, about, it., Unfortunately,, Mr., Rolfe, has, become, something, of, a, poster, child, for, paranoiac, fan, boys, who, feel, they're, being, persecuted, by, feminists., Seeing, the, responses, to, the, responses, to, Mr., Rolfe's, video, (here, and, here), really, make, me, sad., Are, people, really, persecuting, fan, boys, for, not, enjoying, the, trailer, for, Ghostbusters, 2016?, Are, they, being, burned, in, effigy?, Has, anyone, been, killed, because, of, it?, Or, is, this, all, conjecture, based, on, self-delusion, and, some, internet, comments/tweets?, You, can, hate, the, new, Ghostbusters, without, being, a, misogynist, and, I'm, not, saying, you, are, a, misogynist, if, you, do., I'm, not, saying, you, can't, pre-judge, a, movie, based, on, its, preview., Full, Disclosure:, I, have, only, watched, one, of, the, trailers, for, Ghostbusters, 2016, as, I, don't, like, to, watch, a, lot, of, trailers, because, they, can, misrepresent, the, movie, (Hugo),, give, away, plot, twists, (Shutter, Island), or, simply, show, all, of, the, plot, points, of, a, movie., The, one, preview, didn't, look, very, good, but, I'll, still, be, seeing, the, movie, as, I'm, curious, to, see, it., If, you, dislike, Ghostbusters, 2016, because, it's, a, remake, of, a, film, you, hold, sacred, then, get, a, grip., If, you, dislike, the, movie, because, it's, bad,, that's, fine., If, you, don't, see, the, movie, because, you, don't, want, to, spend, money, on, it,, that's, fine., I'm, just, saying, that, with, the, gender-reversal, of, the, film, that, it's, very, easy, for, people, who, misogynist, or, at, least, gynophobic, to, decry, a, movie, they've, never, seen, based, on, the, idea, of, strong, female, characters, and, masquerade, as, simple, "movie, fans, speaking, their, opinion.", But,, please,, don't, try, to, pretend, that, you're, anything, other, than, a, sexist, pig, if, the, real, problem, here, is, that, you, can't, stand, the, idea, of, women, playing, in, your, safe, space.,

However,, July, 2015, episode,, An, Awakening, of, Horror:, The, Bullying, Continues,, is, really, something, special., Here's, the, show's, description:, Join, The, King, of, Splatter, Punk,, William, Pattison, and, special, guest, Hank, Morris, and, they, discuss, Hank's, recent, bout, with, bullying, by, WiHM, ambassador, Heidi, Honeycutt, and, a, number, of, trolls, on, Facebook...., This, episode, is, a, howler., I'm, trying, to, figure, out, just, who, "Hank, Morris", is., I, thought, maybe, he, was, the, person, behind, "Dr., Blood", but, regardless,, the, person, going, by, "Hank, Morris", is, hilarious., The, story, he, spins, just, keeps, getting, increasingly, outrageous, but, either, Morse, is, oblivious, to, that, or, just, doesn't, care., Morse, seems, to, take, everything, that, "Morris", says, to, heart,, including, when, "Morris", starts, talking, about, his, "condition", where, he, has, to, drink, a, lot, of, moonshine!, Morse, doesn't, miss, a, beat,, empathizing, with, a, fellow, misunderstood, horror, fan..., There's, a, bit, of, a, backstory, to, the, episode, that, Morse, doesn't, go, into., He, talks, about, how, "Morris", was, bullied, by, Heidi, Honeycutt., Yet,, there's, no, real, discussion, on, what, that, means., Morse, loves, to, talk, about, people, being, bullied,, never, realizing, that, he, is, the, bully, he, despises., Even, when, "Morris", (in, an, obvious, put-on, voice), suddenly, announces, that, he's, attracted, to, Honeycutt, and, that, Morse, should, offer, an, olive, branch, to, her,, Morse, launches, into, a, convoluted, rant, about, treating, women, equally;, that, he, can, hate, them, as, much, as, he, hates, everyone, else., What, a, guy!, I, hope, that, you, enjoy, this, incredible, episode, of, The, Wolf, Pack, Podcast, as, much, as, I, did., Posted, by, Mike, White, at, 12:27, PM, 1, comment:, Email, ThisBlogThis!Share, to, TwitterShare, to, FacebookShare, to, Pinterest, Labels:, Wolf, Pack, Podcast, Wednesday,, October, 14,, 2015, Cinephilia, &, My, Spleen, &, Holy, Grails, The, workprint, version, of, Apocalypse, Now, has, been, available, on, the, bootleg, market, for, years., I, first, read, about, it, in, the, mid-'90s, and, paid, a, hefty, price, for, three, VHS, tapes, of, it., Oddly,, the, fantastic, website, Cinephilia, &, Beyond, recently, posted, an, article, entitled, THE, HOLY, GRAIL, OF, WORKPRINTS:, THE, FIVE-HOUR, ROUGH, VERSION, OF, ‘APOCALYPSE, NOW’., This, seems, like, a, very, strange, thing, as, a, "holy, grail", is, often, seen, as, something, unattainable, while, this, workprint, is, wide, spread., Author, Peter, Cowie, wrote, about, it, extensively, in, the, The, Apocalypse, Now, Book, in, 2001., What, seems, even, stranger, is, that, the, "article", is, simply, a, list., What's, stranger, still, is, that, this, list, seems, to, be, culled, completely, from, another, source., As, I'm, doing, research, on, Apocalypse, Now, for, an, upcoming, episode, of, The, Projection, Booth,, I, have, been, keeping, notes, about, the, film, and, creating, my, own, "dossier", of, articles, about, it., A, few, months, back, I, made, note, of, the, description, of, a, torrent, on, MySpleen, for, this, workprint, (uploaded, 8/12/2014)., When, I, read, the, Cinephilia, &, Beyond, post,, the, list, and, some, of, the, language, seemed, familiar, so, I, did, a, comparison, of, the, two, and, found, that, they're, nearly, identical., There's, no, author, credit, on, the, Cinephilia, &, Beyond, nor, is, the, uploader, of, the, Torrent, identified., That, said,, I'm, not, going, to, throw, around, The, "P", word, here, but, I, just, wanted, to, say, that, this, might, be, some, fairly, lazy, "journalism", to, just, post, a, copy/paste, list., The, following, is, a, comparison, of, the, two, posts., The, words, in, blue, are, from, MySpleen., The, words, in, red, are, from, Cinephilia, &, Beyond:, Description:, The, holy, grail, of, workprints..., The, 5, hour, workprint, of, Apocalypse, Now., This, is, raw, unedited, footage, from, the, 3, years, Coppola, filmed., The, Theatrical, version, runs, 153, minutes,, the, Redux, version, runs, 203, minutes,, this, version, runs, 289, minutes., In, this, version, you'll, get, to, see, Scott, Glenn's, entire, role,, Dennis, Hopper's, character, meeting, his, end, and, more, of, Marlon, Brando., Workprints,, rough, versions, of, films, before, the, editing, process, kicks, in, and, trims, out, all, the, material, deemed, surplus,, are, considered, priceless, memorabilia, among, filmlovers., The, 5-hour-long, version, of, Francis, Ford, Coppola’s, Apocalypse, Now,, moreover,, is, considered, to, be, the, Holy, Grail, among, them., Now,, we’re, excited, beyond, words, to, share, with, you, the, 289-minute, version, of, this, classic, picture., Just, so, we, give, you, time, to, let, it, sink, in—if, the, theatrical, release, print, lasted, 153, minutes,, and, if, the, Redux, issue, offered, 202, minutes, of, the, film,, this, means, this, rough, cut, gives, us, the, priceless, chance, to, enjoy, an, additional, hour, and, a, half, of, Coppola’s, groundbreaking, study, of, human, nature., Before, you, start, enjoying, this, highly, educational, ride,, let, us, prepare, you, for, what, you’re, about, to, witness., It, became, a, famous, fact, that, it, took, almost, two, years, for, Coppola, and, his, editors, to, cut, down, a, million, feet, of, film, and, turn, it, into, the, movie, filmgoers, got, to, know, back, in, 1979., What, this, workprint, offers, is, an, invaluable, insight, into, the, filmmaking, process,, shedding, light, on, what, kind, of, decisions, Coppola, was, forced, to, make, as, he, labored, to, get, the, film, done., It’s, exhilarating, to, see, practically, everything, the, crew, filmed, during, the, extremely, tough, production, period, in, the, Philippines,, and, it’s, even, more, enlightening, to, witness, what, exactly, failed, to, find, its, place, in, the, final, version, of, the, film,, cut, out, and, ignored, because, Coppola, decided, the, material,, as, exhausting, as, it, was, to, film, it, in, the, first, place,, did, not, enrich, the, story., One, of, the, most, important, things, that, Coppola, cut,, at, least, according, to, our, opinion,, is, the, political, aspect, of, the, film:, scenes, in, which, characters, criticize, the, US, involvement, in, Vietnam., It, was, apparently, decided, the, film, would, benefit, more, from, concentrating, on, psychology, and, human, nature., And, who’s, to, say, Coppola, made, a, bad, call?, During, the, U.S.-Viet, Nam, War,, Captain, Willard, is, sent, on, a, dangerous, mission, into, Cambodia, to, assassinate, a, renegade, colonel, who, has, set, himself, up, as, a, god, among, a, local, tribe., The, following, deleted, scenes, in, this, version, are:, A, longer, opening, montage,, the, entire,
