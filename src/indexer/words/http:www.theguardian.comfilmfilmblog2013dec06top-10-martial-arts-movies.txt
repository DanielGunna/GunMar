Everett, Collection/REX, 10., Once, Upon, a, Time, in, China, The, film, that, kick-started, Hong, Kong, cinema's, kung-fu, renaissance, and, launched, Jet, Li, towards, a, future, of, substandard, western, action, movies., Its, subject, was, already, well, known, to, local, audiences:, Wong, Fei-hung, was, a, real, person:, a, turn-of-the-century, martial, arts, master, and, healer, who's, become, something, of, a, folk, hero., Like, Sherlock, Holmes, or, Robin, Hood,, he'd, been, portrayed, many, times, before., Jackie, Chan, played, him, in, Drunken, Master,, and, a, long-running, Wong, Fei-hung, film, series, during, the, 1950s, and, 60s, gave, roles, to, the, fathers, of, Bruce, Lee, and, Yuen, Wo-ping,, among, many, others., Transposed, to, 1990s, Hong, Kong,, with, the, handover, from, British, to, Chinese, sovereignty, on, the, horizon,, this, story, of, a, Chinese, rebel, fighting, oppressive, colonialist, powers, had, extra, resonance., Its, British, and, American, baddies, are, cartoonishly, demonised,, and, the, plot, is, often, convoluted, to, the, point, of, impenetrability,, admittedly,, but, what, this, film, chiefly, provides, is, dazzling,, colourful,, kinetic,, epic,, pre-CGI, spectacle., Director, Tsui, Hark,, schooled, in, both, the, US, and, Hong, Kong,, fills, the, screen, with, movement, and, energy., The, wire-assisted, fight, scenes, –, choreographed, by, Yuen, Wo-ping,, inevitably, –, are, ingeniously, staged., Earthbound, reality, is, left, far, behind., And, Li, is, simply, incredible., He's, got, gravitas, as, an, actor,, but, when, he's, in, action,, he, really, takes, some, beating., He, does, it, all:, fighting, with, hands,, feet,, sticks,, poles,, umbrellas., He, kills, one, baddie, with, a, bullet, –, without, using, a, gun., But, Li, is, a, gymnast,, too,, pirouetting, and, somersaulting, across, the, screen, with, the, agility, of, a, cat., He's, surely, the, most, graceful, martial, artist, out, there., Those, skills, come, to, bear, in, a, jubilantly, athletic, final, duel,, which, takes, place, in, a, warehouse, conveniently, full, of, bamboo, ladders., It's, one, of, the, most, celebrated, sequences, in, martial, arts, movies,, and, it, leaves, you, wanting, more,, of, which, there, is, plenty:, they, made, four, sequels, in, the, next, two, years., Steve, Rose, 9., Yojimibo, Yojimbo, film, still, Photograph:, Ronald, Grant, Archive, Akira, Kurosawa, drew, upon, American, pulp, sources, for, Yojimbo's, plot,, principally, the, Hollywood, western, but, also, Dashiell, Hammett's, broken-city, melodrama, The, Dain, Curse., Here, a, lone,, probably, disgraced,, certainly, hungry, samurai, (Toshiro, Mifune,, the, Wolf, to, Kurosawa's, Emperor), wanders, into, a, town, where, two, factions, are, in, eternal, conflict,, glaring, at, one, another, from, their, matching, headquarters, on, opposite, sides, of, the, town's, wide,, western-like, main, street., Since, each, faction, lacks, a, distinguished, warrior, with, whose, aid, they, might, tip, the, balance, of, power, in, their, favour,, they, each, badly, want, the, newcomer, on, their, side,, something, the, samurai, figures, out, within, moments,, and, exploits, throughout, the, movie., As, the, power, games, play, out, to, their, nihilistic,, corpse-choked, conclusion,, Kurosawa, demonstrates, a, mastery, of, his, medium, in, almost, every, frame., His, sense, of, spatial, relations, is, beyond, compare:, panels, in, interior, walls, slide, away, to, reveal, whole, exterior, street-scapes, and, crowd, scenes, perfectly, framed, within, the, smaller, new, frame., Intimate, conversations, take, place, as, a, turbulent, skirmish, rages, in, the, deep, background, center-screen,, between, the, talkers', faces, in, the, foreground., And, what, faces!, From, the, moronic, warrior, with, the, M-shaped, unibrow, and, the, giant, wielding, a, huge, mallet, to, Mifune's, increasingly, battered, countenance,, sardonic,, cynical, and, ever, defiant,, every, single, face, is, at, once, a, landscape, and, an, epic, poem, unto, itself., Along, with, all, that, comes, Kurosawa's, furious, visual, energy,, his, virtuoso, choreography, of, moving, camera, and, bodies, of, warring, men;, and, his, talent, for, adding, enriching, layers, of, kinetic,, elemental, motion, –, rain, falling,, leaves, or, smoke, blowing, in, the, unceasing, winds, –, to, the, violence, already, in, play., Yojimbo, led, to, the, Italian, A, Fistful, of, Dollars,, which, in, time, completely, remade, the, American, western,, completing, a, circle, of, international, cultural, exchange, that, foreshadows, a, give-and-take, among, international, filmmakers, that, we, take, for, granted, today., John, Patterson, 8., A, Touch, of, Zen, A1B5WP, A, Touch, Of, Zen, Hsia, Nu, Year, 1972, Director, King, Hu, martial, arts, Adventures, jump, combat, Cinema, Photograph:, Alamy, We, have, A, Touch, of, Zen, to, thank, for, Harvey, Weinstein's, interest, in, Asian, cinema;, it, was, after, Quentin, Tarantino, screened, King, Hu's, 1971, wuxia, that, the, mogul, began, a, controversial, spending, spree, in, the, east, that, led, to, his, current, controversial, involvement, with, Bong, Joon-ho's, Snowpiercer., It's, not, hard, to, see, why:, Hu's, film, is, unusually, epic, for, the, genre,, clocking, in, at, over, three, hours,, and, made, cinema, history, by, being, the, first, Chinese, film, to, win, an, award, at, Cannes,, missing, out, on, the, Palme, d'Or, but, taking, home, the, Technical, prize., A, Touch, of, Zen, is, most, notable, nowadays, as, the, template, for, Ang, Lee's, Crouching, Tiger,, Hidden, Dragon,, being, the, 14th, century, story, of, an, artist,, Ku,, who, encounters, a, beautiful, woman, living, in, a, rundown, house, with, her, elderly, mother., In, true, wuxia, fashion,, however,, she, is, not, all, she, seems,, and, so, the, story, grows,, until, Ku, realises, that, he, is, in, the, middle, of, a, major, dynastic, war, between, rival, factions., And, as, the, story, develops, –, effortlessly, absorbing, elements, of, comedy, and, romance, –, so, does, the, spectacle,, increasing, in, scale, and, scope, in, ways, that, would, be, unimaginable, today., It, is, these, fight, sequences, that, have, endured,, and, although, wuxia, briefly, fell, out, of, favour, soon, after,, it, is, easy, to, see, Hu's, influence, on, the, hit, martial, arts, films, of, recent, years., More, so, than, Crouching, Tiger,, A, Touch, of, Zen, casts, a, long, shadow, over, the, films, of, Chinese, director, Zhang, Yimou,, whose, House, Of, Flying, Daggers, directly, references, Hu's, film, in, its, bravura, bamboo, forest, sequence., But, it, is, Hu's, deadpan, sense, of, the, grand, that, keeps, this, astonishing, film, fresh,, with, its, themes, of, justice, and, nobility,, shot, through, with, a, strange, spirituality, that, earns, the, film, its, title, in, a, sequence, involving, a, pack, of, bouncing,, kick-ass, Buddhist, monks., Damon, Wise, 7., The, Raid, The, Raid., Photograph:, Rex, As, a, breathless, and, brutal, martial, arts, thriller, shot, in, Jakarta, and, directed, by, a, Welshman,, The, Raid, would, already, have, been, worthy, of, note., That, it, is, a, film, of, precision, and, inventiveness,, taking, fight, sequences, into, the, realm, of, horror,, slapstick, comedy,, even, the, musical,, guarantees, its, place, in, action-movie, history., The, plot, is, as, simple, as, its, choreography, is, complicated., A, police, unit, sets, out, one, morning, to, seize, control, of, a, tower, block, in, Jakarta, that, has, fallen, into, the, hands, of, a, gang., But, not, just, any, gang:, this, mob, has, kitted, out, the, high, rise, with, sophisticated, CCTV, and, public, address, systems, monitored, from, a, top-floor, control, room., The, gang-lord,, presiding, over, the, CCTV, screens,, broadcasts, a, call, to, his, tenants:, "We, have, company., You, know, what, to, do.", He, doesn't, mean, put, the, kettle, on, and, crack, open, the, custard, creams., In, the, absence, of, much, dialogue,, the, weapons, do, the, talking:, guns,, knives,, swords,, hammers., A, man, receives, an, axe, to, the, shoulder,, which, is, then, used, to, yank, him, across, the, room., A, refrigerator, doubles, as, a, bomb., The, gang's, most, vicious, member,, Mad, Dog, (Yayan, Ruhian,, who, also, served, as, one, of, the, film's, fight, choreographers),, acts, as, mouthpiece, for, the, film's, philosophy., Casting, aside, his, firearms,, he, explains:, "Using, a, gun, is, like, ordering, takeout.", If, that's, the, case,, Mad, Dog, would, merit, a, fistful, of, Michelin, stars., Some, of, the, fight, sequences, are, enclosed, claustrophobically, in, hallways, where, the, only, option, is, to, use, walls, as, springboards,, Donald, O'Connor-style., Others,, such, as, a, dust-up, in, a, drugs, lab,, expand, like, dance, numbers., Evans's, prime, achievement, has, been, to, make, a, berserk, adventure, characterised, by, clarity., In, contrast, to, most, action, cinema,, the, frenzy, arises, from, the, performers, rather, than, the, editing;, no, matter, how, frenzied, things, get,, we, never, lose, sight, of, who, is, karate-chopping, the, windpipe, of, whom., Ryan, Gilbey, 6., Ong-Bak, Tony, Jaa, in, a, still, from, the, film, Ong, Bak,, no, further, info, Hands, and, feet, are, one, thing, in, martial, arts;, elbows, and, knees, are, quite, another., And, after, seeing, this, Muay, Thai, showreel,, you'd, put, money, on, Tony, Jaa, against, any, other, screen, fighter., Even, in, the, scenes, where, Jaa, isn't, fighting, anyone, at, all,, simply, going, through, some, moves,, he's, awesomely, formidable., Ong, Bak, as, a, movie, is, fairly, straightforward:, city, baddies, steal, a, village's, Buddha, head;, a, humble, peasant, goes, to, get, it, back,, individually, crushing, each, adversary, with, his, bare, hands, in, the, process., That's, all, it, needs., Ong, Bak's, prime, objective, is, to, say,, "Can, you, believe, this, guy?", and, with, the, added, note, that, no, special, effects, or, stunt, doubles, were, used,, it, more, than, accomplishes, it., In, fight, after, fight,, Jaa, unleashes, moves, that, leave, you, thinking,, "That's, gotta, hurt",, if, not, "That's, gonna, require, major, cranial, reconstruction"., No, holds, are, barred, and, few, punches, are, pulled,, but, rather, than, brute, violence,, you're, left, marvelling, at, Jaa's, speed,, technique, and, pain, threshold., The, fights, are, skilfully, staged,, particularly, an, exhilarating,, three-round, barroom, brawl, that, leaves, no, opponent, or, piece, of, furniture, standing., Jaa, shows, off, his, physical, prowess, in, other, ways,, too,, from, an, opening, tree-climbing, race, to, a, Bangkok, street, chase, that, sends, him, along, a, hilarious, assault, course, of, cafe, tables,, market, stalls,, children,, cars,, trucks,, sheets, of, glass, and, hoops, of, barbed, wire., He's, almost, too, much, to, believe,, and, Ong, Bak, acknowledges, our, incredulity, by, frequently, rewinding, the, action, to, show, us, Jaa's, moves, in, slow, motion,, as, if, to, say,, "Do, you, want, to, see, that, again?"., We, do., SR, 5., The, Matrix, Blurring, appearance, and, reality, ..., Keanu, Reeves, and, Hugo, Weaving, in, The, Matrix., Photograph:, Rex, Features, Cocteau, imagined, the, mirror, as, a, gateway, to, another, world, in, his, 1930, film, The, Blood, of, a, Poet,, and, it's, a, testament, to, the, durability, of, this, image, that, when, it, turned, up, again, in, The, Matrix,, it, had, lost, none, of, its, allure., The, film, clocks, up, a, further, debt, in, its, plot,, which, proposes, that, what, we, perceive, as, reality, is, actually, a, cosmetic, facade, constructed, to, conceal, a, terrible, truth, about, our, existence., Neo,, a, computer, boffin, played, by, Keanu, Reeves,, is, selected, to, bear, the, burden, of, enlightenment., Reeves's, blankness, in, the, part, is, perfect,, mainly, because, Neo, is, required, to, display, only, those, skills, and, qualities, that, are, downloaded, into, his, brain., Required, to, master, jujitsu,, he, is, simply, installed, with, the, relevant, computer, programme., In, no, time, at, all,, he, is, pulling, off, those, tricks, from, 1970s, martial, arts, movies,, where, a, man, can, launch, himself, in, a, flying, kick, and, somehow, manage, to, prepare, a, cocktail,, read, a, short, novel, and, fill, out, his, tax, return,, all, before, his, feet, touch, the, ground., The, film's, Cocteau-esque, concept, is, harnessed, to, some, X-Files-style, paranoia,, but, it, is, the, dazzling, martial, arts, work, that, gives, the, film, its, special, lift., The, directors,, the, Wachowski, brothers,, were, already, having, ideas, above, their, station, when, they, came, up, with, The, Matrix, (their, only, previous, film,, after, all,, was, the, sweaty,, claustrophobic, thriller, Bound)., It, was, the, martial, arts, choreographer, Yuen, Woo-ping, who, helped, them, reach, the, next, level., The, movie's, fight, sequences, provide, its, purest, source, of, pleasure, for, a, number, of, reasons., First,, the, violence, doesn't, come, with, redemptive, overtones;, it, is, played, out, for, the, thrill, of, the, choreography,, not, the, anticipation, of, injury, or, righteousness., Death, is, flippant,, but, it, provides, no, moral, kick., Second,, the, movie, introduced, a, strange, new, effect,, much, copied, or, parodied, since, in, everything, from, Charlie's, Angels, to, Shrek:, a, character, freezes, in, midair, while, the, camera, circles, the, tableau, like, a, computer, imagining, a, 3D, representation, of, a, 2D, image., When, the, camera, has, completed, its, movement,, the, physical, motion, of, the, scene, resumes., Suddenly, the, humdrum, vocabulary, of, the, action, movie, has, been, extended, before, our, disbelieving, eyes., RG, 4., House, of, Flying, Daggers, Zhang, Yimou,, who, directed, House, of, Flying, Daggers,, above,, has, directed, the, film, version, Photograph:, c.Sony, Pics/Everett, /, Rex, Featur, Watch, the, opening, 20, minutes, of, House, of, Flying, Daggers, and, it's, not, hard, to, see, why, the, Chinese, picked, its, director,, Zhang, Yimou,, to, direct, the, opening, ceremony, of, the, Beijing, Olympics., Even, though, the, action, unfolds, within, a, reasonably, sized, brothel, waiting, room, instead, of, a, stadium,, there's, all, the, elements, that, Zhang, would, multiply, by, the, thousands, in, 2008:, traditional, Chinese, music,, dancing,, swathes, of, brightly, coloured, silk, cloth,, drummers, and,, of, course,, martial, arts., It, makes, for, a, magnificent, spectacle, that's, sets, a, high, bar, for, the, rest, of, the, movie., Fortunately,, there's, more, dazzle, to, come, in, this, follow-up, to, Zhang's, first, wuxia, film,, Hero., Zhang's, 2006, Curse, of, the, Golden, Flower, concluded, the, trilogy,, but, for, many, the, romantic,, operatic, yet, satisfyingly, compact, Flying, Daggers, represents, the, best, of, the, three., Set, during, the, Tang, dynasty,, two, police, captains,, Leo, (Andy, Lau,, best, known, for, the, thematically-not-dissimilar, Infernal, Affairs, trilogy), and, Jin, (hunky, Takeshi, Kaneshiro), are, searching, for, the, leader, of, the, Flying, Daggers,, a, counterinsurgency, group., They, suspect, blind, courtesan, Mei, (Zhang, Ziyi), may, be, a, secret, member, of, the, Daggers,, so, Jin,, posing, as, a, citizen,, busts, her, out, of, jail, and, goes, on, the, run, with, her,, pursued, by, Leo, and, numerous, expendable, officers., Love, seems, to, flower, between, Jin, and, Mei,, but, no, one, and, nothing, are, as, they, seem, here., Although, the, fights, are, terrifically, choreographed, by, Tony, Ching, Siu-tung, –, especially, a, bamboo-forest, chase, that, tops, Crouching, Tiger,, Hidden, Dragon, and, a, final, mano-a-mano, in, the, snow, –, judged, against, other, classic, martial, arts, films,, Daggers, is, actually, a, little, light, on, combat, scenes., Indeed,, the, fighting, is, so, stringently, stylized, it's, more, like, dancing, with, knives., No, matter:, the, love, story, may, be, almost, as, schematic, as, the, film's, rigorous, use, of, colour,, yet, the, acting, is, so, powerful, from, the, core, trio, that, deep, emotional, depth, is, created, seemingly, out, of, nothing., Leslie, Felperin, 3., Police, Story, No, Merchandising., Editorial, Use, Only., No, Book, Cover, Usage., Mandatory, Credit:, Photo, by, Moviestore,

Collection/REX, Although, it, was, obvious, at, the, time,, it, seems, strange, now, that, Jackie, Chan, was, originally, groomed, by, at, least, one, Hong, Kong, producer, as, a, successor, to, Bruce, Lee,, the, lithe, master, of, martial, arts, whose, style, was, almost, laughably, serious, in, its, grim-faced, intensity., After, a, few, tryouts, in, the, genre,, however,, Chan, took, things, in, a, much, more, comedic,, but, no, less, athletic, route,, which, is, why,, after, breaking, out, in, the, Yuen, Woo-ping, classic, Drunken, Master,, the, former, stuntman, found, himself, in, Hollywood,, adding, light, relief, to, The, Cannonball, Run, in, 1981., Chan's, Hollywood, career,, however,, didn't, pan, out,, and, after, a, disappointment, in, 1985, with, The, Protector, –, a, collaboration, with, neo-grindhouse, director, James, Glickenhaus,, perhaps, not, the, most, sympatico, of, all, possible, talents, –, Chan, returned, to, Hong, Kong, to, take, matters, into, his, own, hands,, directing, and, cowriting, Police, Story,, in, which, he, played, a, disgraced, cop, who, is, forced, to, go, undercover, and, clear, his, name, after, being, framed, by, drug, barons., Making, a, direct, rebuttal, of, the, Hollywood, way, of, doing, things, (in, his, mind,, sloppily, and, half-heartedly),, Chan, prioritised, the, fights, and, stuntwork,, using, the, genre, elements, mostly, as, filler., Refusing, to, use, a, body, double, for, every, scene, (bar, one, that, involved, a, motorcycle),, Chan, began, to, earn, his, reputation, as, a, fearless, and, pioneering, action, star., On, this, film, alone,, he, was, hospitalised, with, concussion,, suffered, severe, burns,, dislocated, his, pelvis, and, was, almost, paralysed, by, a, shattered, vertebrae., The, resulting, film, was, a, huge, hit, and, spawned, five, strong, sequels., Seen, now,, it, seems, remarkably, straight, given, what, was, to, follow, –, the, cartoonish, Rush, Hour, series, –, although, Chan, certainly, must, have, enjoyed, the, irony, of, being, embraced, by, Hollywood, for, a, film, that, is,, essentially,, a, critique, of, everything, it, was, doing, wrong., DW, 2., Crouching, Tiger,, Hidden, Dragon, Why, is, Ang, Lee's, film, Crouching, Tiger,, Hidden, Dragon, such, a, sublime, experience?, Perhaps, because, every, bone, in, your, body, tells, you, it, shouldn't, work., It's, a, tranquil, action, movie., Whoever, heard, of, one, of, those?, And, it's, a, love, story, with, a, kick:, a, kung-fu, kick., It, begins, with, the, theft, of, a, fabled, sword,, the, Green, Destiny., As, the, sword, is, stolen,, the, camera, takes, flight, along, with, the, thief,, for, whom, gravity, is, a, restricting, garment, to, be, cast, off, at, a, moment's, notice., The, warrior, Yu, Shu, Lien, (Michelle, Yeoh), gives, chase,, skipping, blithely, across, rooftops, that, glow, silver, in, the, moonlight., When, the, pursuit, gives, way, to, combat,, the, rule, book, of, action, cinema, is, not, only, discarded, but, sliced, to, ribbons., For, viewers, too, young, to, remember,, the, shock, of, seeing, a, Sam, Peckinpah, shoot-out, back, when, slow, motion, was, an, innovation, rather, than, a, nasty, virus,, then, the, sight, of, these, warriors, levitating, calmly, to, nosebleed-inducing, heights, will, provide, something, of, that, same, liberating, jolt., The, midair, skirmishes, of, martial, arts, movies, were, brought, to, mainstream, audiences, by, The, Matrix,, and, Lee, enlisted, that, film's, choreographer,, Yuen, Woo-ping, (who, later, worked, on, Kill, Bill, and, Kung, Fu, Hustle),, to, take, that, style, even, further., The, resulting, fight, routines, evoke, Olympic, gymnastics,, break, dancing, and, those, cartoon, punch-ups, where, one, of, the, Tasmanian, Devil's, limbs, would, emerge, briefly, from, within, a, frantic, cyclone., And, if, Yu, occasionally, steps, on, her, opponent's, foot,, she's, not, fighting, dirty, –, it's, just, the, only, way, of, ensuring, that, the, battle, remains, at, ground, level., For, all, the, finesse, of, the, choreography,, the, action, sequences, would, be, superficial, without, the, emotional, weight, Lee, brings, to, the, picture,, notably, in, the, largely, unspoken, tenderness, between, Yu, and, her, fellow, warrior, Li, Mu, Bai, (Chow, Yun, Fat)., As, a, director, he, doesn't, differentiate, between, the, way, he, shoots, tenderness, and, violence., In, his, hands,, a, love, scene, can, come, to, be, brutal,, with, a, man's, blood, forming, a, fork, across, his, lover's, breast, as, they, embrace,, while, a, struggle, between, opponents, in, the, forest, treetops,, with, the, supple, branches, doubling, as, nests,, catapults,, rungs, and, bungee, ropes,, achieves, a, sensuous, serenity., RG, 1., Enter, the, Dragon, Enter, the, Dragon,, with, Bruce, Lee., Bruce, Lee, purists, may, or, may, not, agree, that, Enter, the, Dragon, is, his, greatest, film., But, this, is, the, one, that, has, passed, into, legend:, it, was, the, colossal, box, office, smash, of, 1973, and, the, most, famous, film, of, that, unrivalled, martial, arts, superstar, who, had, died, the, summer, before, its, release, of, a, cerebral, reaction, to, painkillers., He, shared, with, James, Dean, the, grim, distinction, of, appearing, posthumously, in, his, most, famous, picture., After, a, career, as, a, child, star, in, Hong, Kong, cinema, –, almost, the, Macaulay, Culkin, of, his, day, –, and, a, spell, on, TV's, The, Green, Hornet,, Lee, exploded, into, action, pictures, that, were, simply, so, popular, and, profitable, that, Warner, Brothers, agreed, to, make, Enter, the, Dragon,, with, Lee, as, star, and, coproducer:, Hollywood's, first, martial, arts, movie., Robert, Clouse, directed,, and, the, script, was, by, Michael, Allin,, who, wrote, the, Isaac, Hayes, film, Truck, Turner., Lalo, Schifrin, composed, the, music., Bruce, Lee, was, possessed, of, extraordinary, physical, grace,, balletic, poise,, lethal, speed, and, explosive, power., He, was, a, master, of, kung, fu,, judo, and, karate,, and, is, considered, the, spiritual, godfather, to, today's, mixed, martial, arts, scene., He, was, not, a, big, man,, and, so, his, presence, was, better, captured, by, the, camera, lens., Moreover,, he, had, a, delicately, handsome,, almost, boyish, face, and, had, a, charm, and, verbal, fluency, as, he, expounded, his, Zen, theories, of, combat, in, interviews,, something, more, like, dynamic, motivational, philosophy, than, any, fortune-cookie, cliché., Lee, had, a, presence, and, charisma, comparable, to, Muhammad, Ali,, and, that, was, perhaps, never, better, captured, than, in, Enter, the, Dragon., Perhaps, only, Jackie, Chan, now, rivals, him, as, an, Asian, star, in, Hollywood, –, and, Hollywood, has, not, shown, much, interest, in, promoting, an, Asian-American, A-lister, since, Enter, the, Dragon., Lee, plays, a, Shaolin, master, who, is, recuited, by, British, intelligence, to, enter, a, martial, arts, tournament, undercover., This, event, is, being, run, by, a, sinister, megalomaniac, called, Han, who, is, suspected, of, involvement, in, drugs, and, prostitution., Lee, has, a, personal, beef, with, Han,, whose, goons, terrorised, and, attempted, to, rape, Lee's, kid, sister, –, she, committed, suicide, rather, than, submit., He, shows, up, at, the, island, with, a, couple, of, American, fighters:, Williams,, played, by, Jim, Kelly,, provides, some, Shaft-style, street, cred, while, Roper,, played, by, John, Saxon,, is, a, playboy, type, who, is, close, to, the, James, Bond, template., In, truth,, of, course,, it, is, Lee, himself, who, is, the, James, Bond,, but, he, is, no, womaniser., Bruce, Lee, has, a, monkish, purity, and, spirituality,, with, a, laser-like, focus, on, exposing, Han, –, and, of, course, kicking, ass., The, look, of, the, movie, is, exotic, and, extravagant,, especially, its, inspired, hall-of-mirrors, showdown,, with, Lee, sporting, the, weird,, almost, tribal, slashes, across, his, midriff., His, strange,, animal, quavering, cry, and, piercing, gaze, are, entirely, unique., But, what, makes, Enter, the, Dragon, outshine, the, rest, is, the, serene,, almost, innocent, idealism, of, Lee, himself., In, the, opening, scenes,, Lee, speaks, humbly, to, the, aged, Abbot, at, his, temple,, coolly, takes, tea, with, the, British, intelligence, chief, Braithwaite,, and, interrupts, their, conversation, to, instruct, a, teenage, boy, in, martial, arts., When, this, young, hothead, is, easily, bested, in, combat,, Lee, says, to, him, with, inimitable, seriousness:, "We, need, emotional, content, –, not, anger.", It, is, the, philosophy, of, this, martial, arts, classic,, and, its, unique, star., Peter, Bradshaw, More, Guardian, and, Observer, critics', top, 10s, •, Top, 10, romantic, movies, •, Top, 10, action, movies, •,
