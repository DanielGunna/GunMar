comments, Few, of, the, griemiest, rappers, Saturday,, August, 2,, 2008, When, I, think, about, the, word, grimy,, I, think, about, the, tone, of, a, rappers, voices, and, the, lyrical, content., I, think, when, it, comes, to, grimy, the, rap, group, 'Onyx', is, the, best, example., They, are, nutting, but, grimy., Real, hardcore, rappers, from, south, side, Queens., I, have, been, fan, of, them, since, their, debut, album., The, songs, have, street, credibility, and, it, is, nutting, but, grimy., The, song, 'move, back', is, hit, I, can, remember, even, a, broader, audience, is, open, for, this, kind, of, hip, hop., The, song, 'slam', is, another, good, example, how, they, move, the, crowd, with, top, notch, hip, hop., The, joint, 'the, worse', is, really, a, good, collabo, with, nicest, rappers, in, the, hip, hop, scene., Also, DMX, is, also, one, of, the, grimiest, rappers., This, rapper, from, Yonkers, has, to, deliver, a, message, to, the, audience, what, the, streets, are, about., His, voice, sounds, grimy, and, so, does, the, lyrics., Only, thing, I, can, not, stand, is, the, fact, that, he, call, him, self, a, dog., Since, his, debut, album, he, has, gained, much, attention, and, he, is, multi, platinum, recording, artist., Songs, such, as, 'what, is, my, name', are, real, classics., The, line, 'I, lost, my, mind,, you, about, to, lose, yours, too', is, a, memorable, line., Read, more..., Posted, by, Unknown, at, 8:44, PM, 0, comments, Labels:, rap, music,, rappers,, raps, My, favorite, years, !!!!!!!!!!, Friday,, August, 1,, 2008, First, of, all, the, first, rapper, I, ever, heard, was, Grand, Master, flash, and, the, furious, five., However, they, made, a, lot, of, impression., I, was, more, into, break, dancing, than, dreaming, about, becoming, a, rapper., The, vibe, was, set, how, the, hip, hop, culture, started., Till, the, early, nineties, I, didn't, started, to, listen, to, rap., This, was, a, crazy, time., I, was, influenced, by, the, whole, west, coast, gangsta, rap, and, became, a, total, fan, of, west, coast, rap., Although, I, felt, like, that, this, was, only, a, one, sub, genre, in, rap, music., I, felt, the, need, for, exploring, more, of, the, raw, and, depth, in, rap, music., I, found, southern, rap,, this, was, also, lot, like, the, west, coast, rap., It, was, also, the, gangsta, vibe, and, the, beats, were, of, that, funk, influence., I, found, later, about, the, east, coast, rap., This, made, me, dig, deeper, into, the, history, of, hip, hop., This, is, where, my, whole, mind, state, changed, when, I, heard, Rakim,, Brand, Nubian, and, Kool, G, Rap., This, was, a, great, era, for, me., This, was, the, era, that, I, felt, that, hip, hop, music, is, not, just, form, of, entertainment, but, also, a, culture., However, I, have, all, my, favorite, albums, sort, out, by, the, year, it, came, out., My, favorite, era, is, from, 1990, till, 1998., These, eight, years, of, my, life, was, everything, was, going, fine., I, was, having, fun, with, my, friends, and, hanging, out, doing, was, kids, do, on, that, age., Now, I, feel, like, that, was, maybe, because, those, were, my, favorite, years, and, I, was, feeling, good,, that, is, why, rap, music, sounds, great, in, my, ear., Since, 2003, I, have, the, feeling, that, rap, music, went, downhill, because, the, quality, of, the, beats, got, too, melodic, and, this, is, for, the, new, generation, in, the, hip, hop, music, a, major, break, through, because, the, broader, audience, can, link, with, this, type, of, music., Read, more..., Posted, by, Unknown, at, 11:26, PM, 0, comments, Labels:, rap,, rap, music,, rappers, IS, RAP, MUSIC, A, SET, UP?, Tuesday,, July, 29,, 2008, I, heard, once, Krs-One, said, that, rap, music, is, a, set, up., It, depends, on, how, a, hip, hop, fan, or, rappers, view, this, statement., I, think, the, way, Krs-One, explain, this, fact, he, feels, victimize, by, his, own, success., This, is, why, he, claims, that, rappers, are, in, danger., I, think, the, listeners, and, all, the, fanatics, trying, to, make, it, are, the, ones, who, are, in, danger., If, you, stand, alone, there, is, no, one, in, your, family, or, in, your, environment, who, are, familiar, with, the, rap, music, business,, then, it, can, be, quite, stressful, job, to, make, it, top, to, the, on, your, own., I, have, seen, this, too, often, around, me, kids, who, started, to, sell, drugs,, because, they, tried, to, live, up, too, the, examples, of, the, rappers, who, are, blowing, up, with, gimmicks., In, this, case, there, are, too, many, kids, who, do, not, have, a, chance, in, the, rap, music, business,, because, they, get, hooked, when, they, start, to, sell, drugs, and, to, their, ideals, they, can, say, good, bye., If, they, only, get, hooked, there, is, always, rehab, for, them., It, gets, even, worse, than, that, it, can, end, up, in, a, war., Some, of, the, rappers, out, nowadays, want, to, be, the, next, Tony, Montana, or, Frank, Lucas., Still, there, is, no, such, thing, as, a, set, up., Because, it, is, truly, a, weakness, to, have, the, neighborhood, thug, appeal, or, want, to, be, ghetto, fabulous., There, are, plenty, of, choices, for, the, kids, in, the, urban, America., So, the, media, hype, and, the, misogyny, lead, rappers, to, act, a, certain, way, for, the, money., This, is, not, a, sign, of, a, set, up, but, more, of, an, wrong, choice, what, rappers, and, the, listeners, make, to, love, the, violence, and, crime, in, rhyme., I, can, say, it, is, quite, ridiculous, when, you, see, Philippines, kids, dressed, up, like, Mexican, gang, members, and, trying, to, put, a, hit, on, a, kid, who, did, nothing, wrong, to, them., This, happened, in, small, country, town,, where, they, do, not, play, rap, music, in, the, clubs, or, where, ever., I, witnessed, this,, as, far, as, I, know, this, kid, they, tried, to, put, a, hit, on, never, touched, their, girl, or, called, their, girls, female, dogs., Rap, music, is, not, a, set, up,, but, more, of, a, reflection, of, the, media, hype, of, Hollywood, drama., There, are, only, few, who, are, really, close, to, the, roots, of, the, hip, hop, culture, and, treat, this, as, a, blessing, and, they, are, not, out, for, fame, or, the, money, they, want, to, show, the, world, what, work, is, and, dedication, is, most, of, all, they, want, to, deliver, a, dope, rhyme, which, can, uplift, the, minds, and, entertain, the, people., Even, Jay-Z, say, that, rap, music, is, a, half, of, a, curse,, no, this, never, can, not, be., I, think, he, is, blessed, with, a, special, gift, that, whole, lots, of, kids, are, dreaming, of., There, is, price, to, be, paid, and, this, comes, with, this, gift., The, price, of, the, fame, is, that, media, will, constantly, follow, the, rappers, and, fans, will, come, to, for, a, autograph., This, price, can, not, be, a, curse, or, a, set, up., To, become, a, famous, rapper, is, a, grown, mans, choice, and, a, young, kids, dream., I, think, Krs-One, and, Jay-Z, can, not, appreciate, the, gift, they, are, blessed, with, or, they, want, to, make, sure, that, the, youth, who, are, willing, to, make, rap, music, their, occupation, will, get, stressed, and, give, up, because, they, are, afraid, that, a, kid, comes, through, and, take, their, market, by, force, showing, his, true, dedication, and, the, skills., When, it, is, a, set, up, there, will, be, quite, a, few, choice, left, to, for, the, urban, kids,, thanks, to, the, racist, economic, wealthy, countries, one, choice, is, left, out, which, is, getting, a, regular, job., The, minorities, are, forced, to, live, up, to, the, media, hype, and, do, the, typical, things, what, their, own, ethnicities, do,, this, will, make, them, a, part, of, their, community, but, they, are, not, able, to, function, as, a, individual., These, things, got, to, do, with, the, choices, what, a, person, make., I, think, even, in, the, most, racist, countries, as, USA, there, is, room, for, minorities, to, find, their, way, if, they, do, not, point, the, finger, at, someone, else, instead, of, looking, at, their, selves., Lacking, individuality, can, be, the, blame, for, people, blaming, the, society, for, their, own, mistakes., There, is, a, limit, for, everything, if, you, trying, to, be, the, hero, and, take, the, justice, in, your, own, hand, it, can, look, like, a, plot, or, set, up, for, the, victimized, citizens., Let’s, say, if, your, colleagues, at, Burger, King, throw, racist, terms, at, your, dome,, this, can, be, painful, plus, and, can, make, you, angry., If, you, trying, to, play, the, judge, and, put, sanctions, on, them, with, violence., Soon, or, later, this, person, will, get, caught, by, the, authorities, and, will, have, to, do, time., This, is, a, classic, sample, of, a, setup., That, rappers, feel, victimized, by, rap, music, and, call, rap, music, a, set, up, sounds, like, Mel, Gibson, being, paranoid, in, the, movie, 'Conspiracy, Theory'., This, is, also, a, sign, of, a, heroin, addiction, or, Schizophrenic, symptoms., Read, more..., Posted, by, Unknown, at,

Wu-Tang, Clan, is, heavily, inspired, by, X-Clan., Anyway, why, Wu-Tang, Clan, is, my, favorite, rap, group, of, all, time, can, be, explained., In, the, nineties, when, I, was, crazy, about, the, west, coast, hip, hop, culture., The, east, coast, struck, with, a, live, influence, of, the, Shaolin, martial, arts, and, the, five, percent, teachings., This, gave, me, a, whole, another, meaning, and, this, was, a, major, turn, point, to, my, flavor, of, rap, music., The, affiliation, with, Shaolin, martial, arts, meant, discipline, and, control, of, the, mind,, body, and, soul., The, Wu, tang, clan, members, could, explain, the, game, of, chess, like, it, was, a, sword, fight., I, interpret, this, like, free, style, rapping, off, top, of, the, head., Although, I, never, practiced, this, art., Untill, couple, of, months, ago., I, happen, to, get, hang, of, it, within, 3, months., It, is, really, a, challenge., I, do, not, practice, this, art, no, more, it, is, no, more, challenging, when, you, master, the, art, of, free, styling, of, top, of, the, head., The, sample, ‘Game, of, chess, is, like, a, sword, fight’, This, was, the, most, memorable, sample, of, the, debut, album, of, Wu-tang, clan., The, whole, concept, knowledge, wisdom, and, understanding, is, put, in, a, bright, light, and, explained, through, parables, and, metaphors, with, rhymes, on, beats, by, Wu-Tang, Clan., It, is, my, own, habit, to, appreciate, the, debut, albums, more, than, the, follow, ups., In, Wu-Tang, Clans, case, it, is, the, also, like, that., Wu, tang, clan, set, trend, with, their, wally, shoes,, hoodies, and, the, PLO, style., I, think, except, for, Masta, Killa, and, GZA, all, the, Wu, members, got, their, own, style, which, is, unique., If, I, have, to, pick, my, favorite, Wu, Member, it, would, be, a, tough, choice, because, they, can, not, be, compared, with, one, and, another., I, think, the, rhyme, style, of, Reakwon, is, the, nicest., Because, this, is, typical, New, York, ghetto, slang., He, can, tell, a, story, without, exaggerating, and, without, emphasizing, the, drama, of, the, people, of, the, ghetto's., It, is, very, realistic, and, has, much, flavor., The, debut, album, contain, samples, from, the, Shoalin, movies, and, even, from, a, Jackie, Chan, movie., The, beats, are, mega, tough, and, only, Wu-Tang, Members, are, able, to, rhyme, over, those, beats., This, album, contains, hip, hop, classics, like, 'Can, it, be, all, so, simple, man'., This, song, is, laced, with, dope, piano, loops, and, the, base, line, is, deeper, than, the, Ocean, it, self., Above, all, the, solo, projects, of, the, Wu-Tang, clan, members, I, appreciate, the, whole, clan's, work, more., They, form, a, chemistry, which, is, never, heard, before, in, the, history, of, the, hip, hop, culture., RZA, is, multi, talented, person, with, much, preciseness, and, he, knows, what, fans, want, to, hear., One, of, the, most, influential, rappers, of, the, Wu-Tang, Clan, is, Killah, Priest., Although, was, not, featured, on, the, most, Wu-Tang, albums,, but, his, solo, debut, album, is, truly, an, underground, classic., The, productions, are, tight, and, the, vocals, are, deep., For, me, the, most, memorable, line, is, 'Watch, hell, freeze, over....'., Wu-Tang, Clan, has, gave, birth, to, other, groups, which, are, spin, offs, such, as, Killa, Army,, Sunz, of, Men,, Royal, Fam,, Gravediggaz,, American, Cream, Team, and, Theodore, Unit, as, far, as, I, know., These, groups, are, all, a, great, contribution, to, the, hip, hop, culture., The, second, album, of, the, Wu-Tang, Clan, is, not, so, raw, as, the, first, one, because, there, were, too, much, synthesizer, beats, on, it., However, the, song, 'It, is, yours', contains, a, beat, which, is, dope, as, uncut, raw, stuff., Read, more..., Posted, by, Unknown, at, 1:45, AM, 0, comments, Labels:, hip, hop, music,, hiphop,, wu-tang, clan, MOBB, DEEP'S, THIRD, ALBUM, :THUMBS, DOWN, Thursday,, July, 24,, 2008, I, have, been, listening, to, Mobb, Deep, since, they, came, out, with, their, second, album., This, album, is, the, most, nicest, album., The, other, albums, are, straight, whack., The, beats, are, produced, sloppy, and, it, has, too, much, of, the, synthetic, beats, and, it, need, more, depths., The, metaphors, are, really, simple, they, do, not, offer, anything, to, think, about, and, the, whole, allure, they, got, on, their, second, album, and, the, magic, is, lost., Prodigy, really, chose, the, wrong, name,, because, he, is, the, most, mediocre, rapper, coming, out, of, Queens., His, affiliate, Big, Noyd, seems, to, be, way, head, of, his, time, only, he, is, young., If, it, wasn't, for, the, beats, he, would, not, a, sell, any, unit., I, can, not, imagine, that, Big, Noyd, waited, since, 1996, to, year, 2002, or, something, to, drop, his, solo, album., This, affiliation, with, Mobb, Deep, shows, his, weakness, for, money., I, think, he, is, depending, from, Mobb, Deep, to, pave, his, way., I, had, some, respect, for, him., If, he, came, out, as, a, solo, artist, with, out, any, affiliation, with, Mobb, Deep., Anyway, Prodigy, seems, not, be, a, lyrical, wonder, child, at, all., There, is, only, one, king, coming, out, of, Queens, that, is, Phife., I, hate, the, fact, that, he, call, him, self, a, Dog., I, really, can, not, see, any, resemblance, of, a, dog, in, him., I, knew, a, friend, of, my, eldest, cousin, he, used, to, rap., His, name, is, Sam, and, this, guy, got, skills., I, think, Prodigy, wished, that, he, could, rhyme, like, this, dude., Anyway, he, gave, up, rapping, for, a, business, in, insurance., I, am, saying, I, know, kids, from, hood, who, have, way, better, skills, that, cony, as, rappers, like, Necro,, Kill, Bill, or, Prodigy., I, am, thinking, that, Mobb, Deep, is, kind, of, selling, out., I, copped, their, album, 'Amerikkka's, nightmare'., This, album, also, contains, synthetic, sounds, and, too, much, garbage, kind, of, rock, influences., I, am, starting, to, get, irritated, by, some, of, the, rap, artists, who, blow, up, and, forget, the, right, ingredients, and, lose, their, original, fan, base, who, copped, their, first, albums, so, that, they, can, buy, a, Lexus., I, think, there, are, still, rappers, who, rhymes, dope, and, still, get, nice, beats, from, the, producers,, because, they, got, their, heart, in, the, right, place, for, the, hip, hop, crowd., I, dare, that, Mobb, Deep, make, another, album, similar, to, Infamous., I, think, even, a, white, girl, would, rap, better, than, Prodigy, on, the, third, album, called, 'Murda, Muzik'., I, heard, a, song, song, called, 'We, Are, The, Truth', on, Tradegy, Khadafi's, album., The, hook, of, this, song, is, rapped, by, Mobb, Deep., That, song, spoiled, the, whole, Khadafi's, album., It, sounds, like, a, 5, years, old, children, trying, to, be, serious, at, a, birthday, party, while, Homie, the, clown, is, around., I, think, I, need, to, go, and, cop, rappers, like, Paul, Wall, and, Eminem, to, feel, Prodigy, and, Havoc, nowadays., Then, it, would, not, be, fair, to, compare, Prodigy, and, Havoc, with, those, garbage, rappers., Mobb, Deep, really, need, to, find, more, inspiration, from, the, Infamous, album., This, album, contains, beats, such, as, 'Give, up, your, goods', and, these, are, classics., Maybe, Scott, Free, saw, it, all, falling, down, through, his, crystal, ball., That, is, why, he, would, not, produce, another, song, for, them, on, no, album, after., Read, more...,

2008, I, woke, up, this, morning, and, checked, out, some, topnotch, stuff., Back, in, 1997, I, heard, the, first, Capone, and, Noreaga, album., This, album, remains, a, classic., The, rhymes, are, real, street, rhymes, and, much, depth, about, the, struggle., The, song, called, T.O.N.Y, is, one, of, the, dope, songs, on, this, album, 'War, Report'., Back, in, 2000, when, I, was, kind, of, lost, and, wonder, how, to, make, some, money., Thanks, to, this, album, I, found, my, way., I, realized, that, I, do, not, have, to, do, what, these, kids, go, through., I, realized, that, I, have, plenty, of, chances, in, this, society., I, did, not, have, to, sell, dope., I, do, not, have, to, car, jack, or, any, crime, stuff, these, kids, have, to, go, through., Unlike, other, kids, that, use, the, rappers, as, they, role, models., I, never, did, that., I, only, had, to, fight, the, rappers, lyrically, to, get, my, name, known., I, am, from, the, sub, urbs., Thanks, to, God, there, is, no, crack,, crime, or, anything, else, in, my, neighborhood., I, am, crazy, about, rap, music., Simply, I, can, relate, to, rappers, from, the, ghetto's,, because, they, seems, to, have, to, deal, with, lots, of, dirt., Even, for, the, Ghetto, kids, they, are, responsible, for, their, own, destiny., I, think, even, planets, and, stars, can, not, decide, for, these, kids, to, succeed, in, anything, they, do., I, compare, my, self, with, the, most, fortunate, people, on, this, planet, and, realize, that, I, am, not, doing, bad., I, think, money, can, make, the, things, lot, easier., First, of, all, making, it, easy, to, make, money, can, get, you, any, where, you, want., Back, in, the, days, people, like, Calvin, Broadus, and, Minister, Farrahkan, was, trying, to, band, rap,, because, the, rappers, have, a, bad, influence, on, the, kids., I, can, remember, that, there, was, a, bulldozer, running, over, a, bunch, of, cd's., This, is, really, ridiculous,, because, they, can, not, stop, all, the, violence, in, the, streets., They, need, to, take, the, crime, out, of, the, streets,, before, anything., Rap, is, a, music, stream, which, portrait, a, vivid, picture, liver, than, Rembrandt, about, the, streets., I, never, heard, that, rappers, like, Kool, G, Rap, smuggled, ship, full, of, China, white, into, States., So, are, these, hypocrites, going, to, stop, the, Hollywood, producers, putting, out, movies, like, Reservoir, Dogs, and, Usual, Suspects., I, think, rap, music, is, not, only, entertainment,, but, also, a, education., For, me, it, is, like, hearing, the, things, what, I, do, not, have, to, do., Hearing, the, law, books, over, and, over, again., If, I, hear, I, have, to, face, 7, long, years, in, prison, that, means, for, me, that, this, rapper, done, the, wrong, thing, and, the, consequence, is, loosing, his, freedom, from, the, crime, he, done., I, take, the, struggle, of, some, rappers, as, examples, what, can, happen, if, making, the, wrong, choice., Even, the, most, negative, rappers, can, mean, some, sort, of, positive, message, for, me., The, positive, thing, can, be, the, getting, not, involved, in, the, crime, stuff, they, are, into., I, you, listen, to, a, 'Onyx', album, and, do, all, the, things, they, do, you, will, be, end, up, in, prison, without, a, doubt., What, I, mean, is, the, whole, responsibility, is, in, the, hand, of, the, listener., Do, not, expect, your, parents, to, watch, everything, you, do., Rather, blame, your, self, for, the, mistakes, you, made, and, learn, form, some, of, the, rappers, what, to,
