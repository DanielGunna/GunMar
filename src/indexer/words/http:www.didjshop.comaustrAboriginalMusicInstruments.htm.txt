August, 2003, Neville, H., Fletcher, Research, School, of, Physical, Sciences, Australian, National, University,, Canberra, 0200, and, also, School, of, Physics,, University, of, New, South, Wales, Sydney, 2052, ABSTRACT, The, Australian, Aboriginal, people, developed, three, musical, instruments, -, the, didjeridu,, the, bullroarer,, and, the, gum-leaf., Most, well, known, is, the, didjeridu,, a, simple, wooden, tube, blown, with, the, lips, like, a, trumpet,, which, gains, its, sonic, flexibility, from, controllable, resonances, of, the, player's, vocal, tract., The, bull-roarer, is, a, simple, wooden, slat, whirled, in, a, circle, on, the, end, of, a, cord, so, that, it, rotates, about, its, axis, and, produces, a, pulsating, low-pitched, roar., The, gum-leaf,, as, the, name, suggests,, is, a, tree, leaf,, held, against, the, lips, and, blown, so, as, to, act, as, a, vibrating, valve, with, "blown-open", configuration., Originally, intended, to, imitate, bird-calls,, the, gum-leaf, can, also, be, used, to, play, tunes., 1., INTRODUCTION, The, Australian, Aboriginal, people, have, lived, in, this, country,, probably, for, more, than, 40,000, years,, with, almost, no, contact, with, the, outside, world., During, that, time, they, developed, sophisticated, tools, such, as, the, woomera, spear-thrower, and, the, returning, boomerang., They, also, developed, three, musical, instruments, -, the, didjeridu,, usually, spelt, "didgeridoo", in, the, non-academic, literature, and, actually, called, a, yidaki, or, yiraki, in, the, Aboriginal, language, of, the, region, where, it, originated,, the, bull-roarer,, and, the, gumleaf., The, didjeridu, is, a, simple, wooden, tube, blown, with, the, lips, like, a, trumpet,, which, gains, its, sonic, flexibility, from, controllable, resonances, of, the, player's, vocal, tract., The, bull-roarer,, called, by, other, names, in, Aboriginal, languages,, is, a, simple, wooden, slat, whirled, in, a, circle, on, the, end, of, a, cord, so, that, it, rotates, about, its, axis, and, produces, a, pulsating, low-pitched, roar., The, gum-leaf,, as, the, name, suggests,, is, a, leaf, from, a, Eucalypt, tree,, held, against, the, lips, and, blown, so, as, to, act, as, a, vibrating, valve, with, "blown-open", configuration,, denoted, by, (+,-)., The, sounding, pitch, is, controlled, by, vocal, tract, resonances, and, is, typically, about, an, octave, above, the, female, singing, voice., Originally, intended, to, imitate, bird-calls,, the, gum-leaf, can, also, be, used, to, play, tunes., This, paper, will, briefly, describe, each, of, these, instruments., 2., THE, DIDJERIDU, The, didjeridu, originated, in, Arnhem, Land, on, the, northern, coastline, of, central, Australia,, and, has, some, similarity, to, bamboo, trumpets, and, even, bronze, horns, developed, in, other, cultures,, though, it, pre-dates, most, of, these, by, many, millennia., The, characteristic, feature, is, that, the, didjeridu,, which, is, a, slightly, flaring, wooden, tube, about, 1.5, metres, in, length,, is, simply, hollowed, out, by, natural, termites, ("white, ants"), from, the, trunk, of, one, of, the, small, trees, of, the, region., After, cutting, down,, the, instrument, is, cleaned, out, with, a, stick,, the, outside, refined, by, scraping, and, then, painted, with, traditional, designs,, and, the, blowing, end, smoothed, by, adding, a, rim, of, beeswax., Figure, 1., Spectra, of, didjeridu, sound., (a), an, uninflected, drone,, and, (b), a, drone, with, two, prominent, formant, bands., (From, [4]), The, predominant, sound, of, the, didjeridu, is, a, low-pitched, drone, with, frequency, around, 70Hz,, but, depending, significantly, upon, the, length, of, the, instrument, and, the, flare, of, its, bore., The, second, mode, of, the, tube,, with, frequency, a, little, less, than, 1.5, times, that, of, the, fundamental, (because, of, the, tube, flare), is, used, sparingly, as, an, accent, to, the, sound,, and, the, main, variation, comes, from, production, of, pronounced, formant, bands,, the, frequencies, of, which, can, be, adjusted, by, the, player, over, a, range, from, about, 1kHz, to, 3kHz,, as, shown, in, Fig., 1., In, traditional, use,, the, didjeridu,, with, clap-sticks, for, emphasis,, accompanies, songs, or, illustrates, traditional, stories, about, ancestors, and, animals, [1]., Recently,, however,, its, use, has, spread, into, the, popular, music, domain, and, has, had, world-wide, influence, [2]., The, acoustics, of, the, didjeridu, tube, is, simple., Because, of, the, irregular, shape, and, general, slight, flare,, the, upper, resonances, (impedance, maxima), are, not, well, aligned, with, odd, harmonics, of, the, fundamental,, and, the, main, determinant, of, quality, is, the, smoothness, of, the, walls,, on, a, sub-millimetre, scale,, and, the, absence, of, cavities., The, diameter, of, the, blowing, end,, typically, about, 30mm,, must, also, be, a, convenient, match, to, the, lips, of, the, player., The, real, acoustic, interest, comes, from, the, techniques, by, which, unusual, sounds, are, made, [3]., The, prime, technique, is, one, involving, adjustment, of, the, impedance, maxima, of, the, vocal, tract,, as, judged, from, the, vibrating, lip, valve,, since, this, impedance, is, effectively, in, series, with, the, comparable, impedance, of, the, didjeridu, tube, itself., The, player, achieves, this, adjustment, by, raising, the, tongue, to, narrow, the, airway, near, the, lips, and, further, adjusting, the, spacing, between, the, rear, of, the, tongue, and, the, hard, palate, [4]., Some, further, results, of, research, on, this, subject, are, presented, in, a, recent, paper, by, Wolfe, et., al., [5]., The, main, reason, that, these, techniques, are, so, effective, in, the, didjeridu,, compared, with, other, lip-driven, instruments,, is, that, the, diameter, of, the, instrument, bore, near, the, lips, is, quite, similar, to, that, of, the, upper, vocal, tract,, and, there, is, no, intervening, mouthpiece, cup, to, isolate, one, from, the, other., The, other, impressive, contribution, to, didjeridu, sound, comes, from, a, technique, in, which, vocalisation, occurs, simultaneously, with, normal, lip-generated, drone., There, are, then, two, pressure-operated, valves,, the, vocal, folds, and, the, lips,, acting, in, series, upon, the, air, flow., Because, the, operation, of, each, valve, is, nonlinear,, since, the, air, flow, is, essentially, governed, by, a, Bernoulli, equation,, this, generates, multiple, sum, and, difference, frequencies, n, f1, ±, m, f2in, the, sound, output, [3]., If, the, player, sings, a, note, a, musical, tenth, above, the, drone,, so, that, f2, =, (5/2), f1,, then, in, particular, the, sub-octave, f1, /2, is, generated,, giving, a, deep, "growl"., In, addition,, the, player, may, insert, many, other, transient, sounds, to, mimic, the, cries, of, dingoes, or, birds,, with, marked, dramatic, effect., 3., THE, BULLROARER, Since, there, are, no, bull-like, animals, in, Australia,, this, is, a, misnomer, for, the, Aboriginal, instrument,, but, the, actual, word, used, is, "secret-sacred", and, not, shared, with, non-Aboriginal, people., The, instrument, itself, consists, of, a, simple, wooden, slat,, 30, to, 40cm, in, length, and, 5, to, 7cm, wide, that, is, whirled, around, in, a, circle, on, the, end, of, a, length, of, cord., The, slat, rotates, under, the, influence, of, aerodynamic, forces, and, generates, a, pulsating, sound, with, a, frequency, typically, around, 80Hz., This, sound, is, an, important, feature, of, Aboriginal, initiation, ceremonies., The, instrument, itself, is, by, no, means, unique, to, Australia,, and, similar, sound, generators, have, been, used, by, populations, as, diverse, as, those, of, ancient, Egypt, and, the, Inuit, of, Northern, Canada., An, Australian, instrument, is, shown, in, Fig., 2., The, aerodynamics, of, sound, generation, in, the, bullroarer, has, been, described, in, detail, elsewhere, [6],, and, only, an, outline, will, be, given, here., Since, the, quasi-static, aerodynamic, forces, and, torques, on, the, slat, balance, out, over, a, single, period, of, its, revolution,, the, aerodynamic, torque, driving, its, rotation, depends, upon, the, rate, of, rotation, itself., There, is, one, rotation-inducing, torque, term, that, is, linear, in, slat, rotation, speed,, and, also, a, drag, term, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, rotation, speed,, These, lead, to, a, threshold, rotation, rate, that, must, be, exceeded, to, begin, the, process,, and, then, to, an, upper, limit, to, the, rotation, rate., The, steady, angular, rotation, rate, f, of, a, rectangular, slat, of, width, W, swung, through, the, air, on, a, string, of, length, L, with, rotation, frequency, F, can, be, shown, to, be, approximately, f, =, 1.1, LF/, W, -, 5, ,, where, f, and, F, are, in, rotations, per, second., Each, rotation, of, the, slat, creates, an, oscillating, flow, dipole, and,, from, considerations, of, symmetry,, the, dipole, oscillation, frequency,, and, thus, the, radiated, sound, frequency,, is, 2f., The, radiated, acoustic, power, P, is, approximately, P, =, 3, (p/c3), H2V6, where, H, is, the, length, of, the, slat,, p, is, the, density, of, air,, c, is, the, speed, of, sound, in, air,, and, V=2πLF, is, the, speed, of, the, slat, through, the, air., From, these, two, equations, we, see, that, wide, slats, produce, sound, of, lower, frequency, but, that, the, radiated, power, is, independent, of, slat, width., Sound, frequency, is,, however,, proportional, to, airspeed, and, thus, to, arm, rotation, rate,, and, the, radiated, power, is, a, strong, function, of, this, arm, rate., For, typical, conditions,, the, radiated, power, is, a, few, milliwatts, for, an, arm, rotation, rate, of, 120, r.p.m.,, which, is, about, as, fast, as, can, normally, be, achieved., Sound, radiation, is, nearly, omnidirectional., Because, the, output, power, is, a, strong, function, of, airspeed, V,, and, the, arm, rotation, is, normally, faster, on, the, down-sweep, than, on, the, up,, the, sound, pulsates, with, a, frequency, typically, between, 1, and, 2Hz., There, is, an, additional, slower, pulsation, with, a, period, of, several, seconds, that, derives, from, the, fact, that, the, slat, rotation, gradually, twists, the, cord,, providing, a, contrary, torque, which, eventually, stops, the, rotation, and, re-launches, it, in, the, opposite, sense., Figure, 2., An, Australian, bullroarer., (From, [6]), Figure, 3., (a), The, pressure, waveform, of, sound, from, a, bullroarer,, showing, typical, pulsations., (b), Frequency, analysis, of, this, sound,, showing, low, harmonic, development., (From, [6]), Analysis, of, the, sound,, as, in, Fig., 3,, shows, little, harmonic, development,, the, second-harmonic, peak, being, about, -30dB, relative, to, the, fundamental., The, peaks, are,, however,, somewhat, broadened, because, of, the, variable, rotational, speed, of, a, human, arm., 4., THE, GUMLEAF, The, gumleaf, is, altogether, more, primitive, as, a, musical, instrument,, since, it, consists, simply, of, a, leaf,, the, shape, of, which, is, illustrated, in, Fig., 4(a),, from, one, of, the, various, species, of, Eucalypt, trees, growing, throughout, Australia,, held, against, the, lips, using, the, fingers, of, both, hands., It, does,, however,, have, a, long, tradition, and, culture, [7]., In, the, normal, playing, configuration,, shown, in, Fig.4(b),, the, leaf, is, held, tightly, against, the, lower, lip, and,, in, a, bent, shape,, lightly, against, the, upper, lip, [8]., It, is, stretched, rather, tightly, between, the, two, hands., When, air, pressure, is, applied, through, the, mouth,, it, tends, to, lift, the, top, of, the, leaf, away, from, upper, lip, and, allow, air, to, escape,, so, in, this, sense, the, valve, can, be, described, as, an, "outward-swinging, door",, which, is, given, the, symbol, (+,-),, indicating, the, effect, on, the, flow, of, applying, pressure, from, the, supply, side, (+), and, from, the, exhaust, side, (-)., Its, configuration, is, thus, similar, to, that, of, the, valve, constituted, by, the, lips, of, a, brass-instrument, player,, although, these, are, sometimes, (+,+), as, in, a, sliding, door,, and, the, opposite, of, the, reed, of, a, clarinet,, which, is, (-,+),, as, in, an, inward-swinging, door., The, acoustic, behaviour, of, valves, of, each, of, these, types, has, been, examined, elsewhere, [9,10],, and, this, treatment, provides, the, basis, for, the, present, discussion., Although, it, takes, a, good, deal, of, trial, and, error, for, a, beginner, to, even, produce, a, sound, from, a, gumleaf, held, as, indicated, in, Fig., 4(b), above,, a, skilled, player, can, control, the, pitch, with, good, accuracy, over, a, range, of, more, than, an, octave, and, play, simple, tunes, with, ease,, the, pitch, range, being, typically, from, about, 500, to, 1000Hz., Interest, therefore, centres, on, exactly, how, this, is, done., Theory, [9], and, experiment, [10], agree, that, for, a, valve, with, configuration, (+,-), to, oscillate,, the, sum, of, the, up-stream, and, down-stream, acoustic, impedances, must, have, a, negative, imaginary, component., Since, the, downstream, impedance, is, essentially, zero, in, this, case,, this, implies, that, the, mouth, and, vocal, tract, must, present, a, compliant, (capacitive), impedance, at, the, lips., When, this, condition, is, satisfied,, the, valve, will, oscillate, provided, the, applied, air, pressure, exceeds, a, certain, threshold, and, the, losses, are, not, too, great., The, actual, oscillation, frequency, is, necessarily, higher, than, the, mechanical, resonance, frequency, of, the, elastically, braced, leaf,, and, is, further, determined, by, the, magnitude, of, the, impedance, presented, by, the, mouth, to, the, leaf., If, the, imaginary, part, of, this, impedance, is, negative, and, large,, corresponding, to, a, small, enclosed, air, volume, in, the, mouth, and, a, narrow, passage, to, the, lower, vocal, tract,, then, the, oscillation, frequency, of, the, valve, will, be, much, higher, than, its, natural, frequency., In, many, ways,, then,, the, technique, for, varying, the, mouth, and, vocal, tract, when, playing, the, gumleaf, is, similar, to, that, used, in, whistling., Figure, 4., (a), The, shape, of, a, typical, gumleaf, from, a, Eucalypt, tree., (b), In, normal, playing,, the, leaf, is, held, firmly, against, the, lower, lip, and, rested, lightly, against, the, upper, lip,, and, it, is, the, upper, edge, of, the, leaf, that, vibrates., (c), A, variant, way, of, holding, the, leaf, that, results, in, a, raucous, quasi-chaotic, sound., As, the, gumleaf, valve, opens, and, closes,, so, the, pressure, in, the, mouth, falls, and, rises,, with, a, phase, advance, of, about, ?/2, relative, to, the, lip, opening., Because, the, airflow, through, the, valve, is, in, turn, proportional, to, its, opening, area, and, to, the, square, root, of, the, driving, pressure,, this, nonlinear, relationship, generates, harmonics, of, the, fundamental, frequency,, and, the, sound, is, rich, in, upper, partials, and, has, an, incisive, quality., There, is, one, other, way, of, playing, the, gumleaf, that, is, also, worthy, of, mention., The, configuration, used, is, shown, in, Fig., 4(c),, with, the, leaf, simply, lying, parallel, to, the, slot, between, the, lips., As, a, variant,, the, leaf, is, sometimes, held, vertically, between, the, sides, of, two, opposed, thumbs,, which, are, pressed, against, the, lips, to, create, essentially, the, same, configuration., The, aerodynamic, behaviour, is, now, very, different,, and, laboratory, investigations, suggest, that, the, leaf,, which, is, essentially, flat,, moves, backwards, and, forwards, in, the, slot, and,, at, the, same, time,, twists, about, its, longitudinal, axis., This, motion, repeatedly, narrows, and, widens, the, flow, channel, at, a, frequency, equal, to, twice, the, mechanical, oscillation, frequency, of, the, leaf, and, so, has, a, similar, effect, on, the, air, flow, and, thus, on, the, emitted, sound., In, a, larger-scale, laboratory, experiment, the, motion, could, be, made, simple, and, regular,, but, in, most, playing, situations, the, leaf, makes, irregular, contact, with, the, lips, or, the, thumbs, and, this, upsets, the, motion., The, resulting, sound,, while, having, a, predominant, pitch,, is, rough, and, quasi-chaotic., It, is, useful, for, special, effects,, such, as, imitating, the, cry, of, the, native, sulphur-crested, cockatoo, [11],, but, has, no, obvious, musical, value., 5., CLAPSTICKS, As, in, most, cultures,, the, Aborigines, also, used, percussive, instruments, in, their, ceremonies., Often, these, were, simply, two, boomerangs, clashed, together,, but, they, also, made, special, shaped, sticks, for, this, purpose., Because, the, wood, used, is, a, fine-grained, hardwood,, the, clapsticks, are, physically, long-lasting, and, produce, a, sharp, and, well, defined, sound., In, their, usual, form,, these, sticks, are, about, 200mm, in, length, and, 20mm, in, diameter, and, are, shaped, to, a, long, point, at, each, end., One, stick, is, held, in, each, hand, and, they, are, struck, together, at, about, the, mid-point, of, each., The, pointed, ends, ensure, that, the, fundamental, transverse, vibration, has, a, high, frequency,, so, that, the, percussive, effect, stands, out, well, above, the, drone, of, the, didjeridu., 6., CONCLUSION, Ethnomusicology, is, a, very, interesting, field,, and, it, is, made, even, more, interesting, when, allied, with, a, study, of, the, acoustics, of, the, musical, instruments, that, were, developed, by, the, society, under, study., The, musical, instruments, of, the, Australian, Aboriginal, people, have, come, into, world, prominence, because, of, the, popularity, of, the, didjeridu,, both, as, a, tourist, item, and, as, a, musical, instrument., It, is, only, recently, that, we, have, begun, to, have, an, appreciation, of, the, acoustical, subtleties, associated, with, performance, on, this, and, other, ancient, instruments., REFERENCES, [1], Jones,, T.A.,, "The, didjeridu", Studies, in, Music, (University, of, Western, Australia), 1,, 23-55, (1967)., [2], Neuenfeld,, K., (ed.), The, Didjeridu:, From, Arnhem,
