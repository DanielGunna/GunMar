[Browse, All, ipl2, Pathfinders, Alphabetically, |, Browse, All, ipl2, Pathfinders, by, Subject, Organizing, the, Web:, Resources, for, Librarians, Organizing, the, Web, -, providing, users, with, better, ways, of, finding, Internet, resources, that, suit, their, needs, -, is, a, problem, of, current, interest, to, all, types, of, libraries, and, information, professionals., The, idea, of, "organizing, the, Web", has, many, facets., It, may, involve, cataloging, Web, sites, and, other, Internet, resources,, in, either, traditional, or, non-traditional, ways., It, might, mean, improving, subject, access, to, Internet, resources, by, applying, controlled, vocabularly, or, number, classification, schemes., Or,, it, might, mean, embedding, Web, documents, with, metadata, elements, to, facilitate, search, and, retrieval,, or, markup, language, tags, to, provide, richer, information, about, digitized, documents., This, pathfinder, is, intended, to, provide, starting, points, for, locating, resources, on, all, these, topics., This, guide, is, not, meant, to, be, exhaustive,, but, to, provide, a, jumping-off, point, for, learning, about, and, applying, methods, of, organizing, the, Web., I've, included, some, suggestions, for, finding, print, resources,, links, to, the, home, pages, of, some, existing, projects, in, the, fields, of, Internet, cataloging, and,

locating, further, Internet, and, print, resources, on, the, subjects, of, Internet, cataloging,, classification, and, metadata., Print, Resources, Up-to-date, print, resources, on, Internet-related, topics, are, hard, to, find, since, Internet, issues, often, change, and, develop, faster, than, books, and, articles, can, make, it, into, print., Books, on, "libraries, and, the, Internet", tend, to, give, general, overviews, of, metadata, or, Internet, cataloging,, without, going, into, detail, about, specific, cataloging, standards, and, procedures., Journal, articles, may, provide, a, more, timely, discussion, of, specific, issues,, although, the, time, lag, between, writing, and, publication, of, articles, can, still, be, a, factor., The, web, sites, listed, in, this, pathfinder, are, good, sources, of, keywords, to, use, when, searching, index, databases, such, as, LISA, or, Library, Literature., Small, publications, by, library-related, organizations,, such, as, OCLC,, are, another, place, to, look, for, up-to-date, and, detailed, explanations, of, cataloging, practice,, although, the, most, current, versions, of, this, information, tend, to, appear, online., Here, are,
