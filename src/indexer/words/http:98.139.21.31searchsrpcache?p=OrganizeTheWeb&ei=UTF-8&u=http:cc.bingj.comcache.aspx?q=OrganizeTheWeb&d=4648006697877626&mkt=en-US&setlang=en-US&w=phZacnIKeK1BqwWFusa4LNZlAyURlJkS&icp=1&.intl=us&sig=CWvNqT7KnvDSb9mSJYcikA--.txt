book, contents, chapter, contents, previous, page, next, page, 3, Information, Architecture, Organizing, Your, Information, Our, day-to-day, professional, and, social, lives, rarely, demand, that, we, create, detailed, architectures, of, what, we, know, and, how, those, structures, of, information, are, linked., Yet, without, a, solid, and, logical, organizational, foundation,, your, web, site, will, not, function, well, even, if, your, basic, content, is, accurate,, attractive,, and, well, written., There, are, five, basic, steps, in, organizing, your, information:, Inventory, your, content:, What, do, you, have, already?, What, do, you, need?, Establish, a, hierarchical, outline, of, your, content, and, create, a, controlled, vocabulary, so, the, major, content,, site, structure,, and, navigation, elements, are, always, identified, consistently;, Chunking:, Divide, your, content, into, logical, units, with, a, consistent, modular, structure;, Draw, diagrams, that, show, the, site, structure, and, rough, outlines, of, pages, with, a, list, of, core, navigation, links;, and, Analyze, your, system, by, testing, the, organization, interactively, with, real, users;, revise, as, needed., Content, Inventories, A, content, inventory, is, a, detailed, listing, of, basic, information, about, all, the, content, that, exists, in, a, site, to, be, redesigned, or,, in, some, cases,, a, site, to, be, newly, created, from, existing, content, resources., Although, a, content, inventory, is, often, tedious, and, time-consuming, to, create,, it, is, an, essential, component, of, any, rational, scope, planning, for, a, web, project., Content, inventories, are, most, useful, in, the, initial, project, planning, and, information, architecture, phases,, but, a, detailed, content, inventory, will, be, useful, throughout, the, project, for, both, planning, and, build-out, of, the, site., The, work, of, moving, through, an, existing, site, and, recording, information, on, each, page, is, detailed,, but, it’s, also, easy, to, divide, up, among, team, members, who, work, through, different, subsections, or, directories, of, the, site., The, team, members, making, the, site, inventory, must, both, have, access, to, the, site, pages, in, a, web, browser, and, be, able, to, view, the, site, file, structure, on, the, server, to, ensure, that, all, sections, of, content, are, inventoried., Web, content, inventories, of, existing, sites, commonly, take, the, form, of, a, spreadsheet, file, with, multiple, worksheets,, containing, long, listings, of, every, page, in, the, site,, along, with, such, essential, characteristics, as, the, page, title,, url,, people, responsible, for, the, content,, and, so, on., Each, page, typically, gets, a, row, on, the, spreadsheet,, with, columns, listing, such, basic, information, as:, Unique, id, number, for, project, purposes, Page, title, Page, template, or, type, url, General, type, of, content, Person, responsible, for, the, content, Keep/revise/discard, decisions, Create, new, content?, Review, status, Hierarchies, and, taxonomies, Hierarchical, organization, is, a, virtual, necessity, on, the, web., Most, sites, depend, on, hierarchies,, moving, from, the, broadest, overview, of, the, site, (the, home, page),, down, through, increasingly, specific, submenus, and, content, pages., In, information, architecture, you, create, categories, for, your, information, and, rank, the, importance, of, each, piece, of, information, by, how, general, or, specific, that, piece, is, relative, to, the, whole., General, categories, become, high-ranking, elements, of, the, hierarchy, of, information;, specific, chunks, of, information, are, positioned, lower, in, the, hierarchy., Chunks, of, information, are, ranked, in, importance, and, organized, by, relevance, to, one, of, the, major, categories., Once, you, have, determined, a, logical, set, of, priorities, and, relations, in, your, content, outlines,, you, can, build, a, hierarchy, from, the, most, important, or, general, concepts, down, to, the, most, specific, or, detailed, topics., Taxonomies, and, controlled, vocabularies, Taxonomy, is, the, science, and, practice, of, classification., In, information, architecture,, a, taxonomy, is, a, hierarchical, organization, of, content, categories,, using, a, specific,, carefully, designed, set, of, descriptive, terms., As, any, experienced, editor, or, librarian, can, tell, you,, one, of, the, biggest, challenges, of, organizing, large, amounts, of, information, is, developing, a, system, for, always, referring, to, the, same, things, the, same, way:, a, controlled, vocabulary,, in, library, science, parlance., One, of, the, most, important, jobs, of, the, information, architect, thus, is, producing, a, consistent, set, of, names, and, terms, to, describe, the, chief, site, content, categories,, the, key, navigation, site, links,, and, major, terms, to, describe, the, interactive, features, of, the, site., This, controlled, vocabulary, becomes, a, foundational, element, of, the, content, organization,, the, user, interface,, the, standard, navigation, links, seen, on, every, page, of, the, site,, and, the, file, and, directory, structure, of, the, site, itself., Five, hat, racks:, Themes, to, organize, information, In, Information, Anxiety, (1989),, Richard, Saul, Wurman, posits, that, there, are, five, fundamental, ways, to, organize, information:, the, “five, hat, racks”, on, which, you, can, hang, information., Category, Organization, by, the, similarity, of, characteristics, or, relatedness, of, the, items., This, is, a, particularly, useful, approach, when, all, the, things, being, organized, are, of, equal, or, unpredictable, importance., Examples, include, topics, of, books, in, a, bookstore, or, library, and, items, in, a, department, or, grocery, store., Time, Organization, by, timeline, or, history,, where, elements, are, presented, in, a, sequential, step-by-step, manner., This, approach, is, commonly, used, in, training., Other, examples, include, television, listings,, a, history, of, specific, events,, and, measuring, the, response, times, of, different, systems., Location, Organization, by, spatial, or, geographic, location,, most, often, used, for, orientation, and, direction., This, most, graphic, of, the, categories, obviously, lends, itself, to, maps, but, is, also, used, extensively, in, training,, repair,, and, user, manual, illustrations, and, other, instances, where, information, is, tied, to, a, place., Alphabetic, Organization, based, on, the, initial, letter, of, the, names, of, items., Obvious, examples, are, telephone, and, other, name-oriented, directories,, dictionaries,, and, thesauri,, where, users, know, the, word, or, name, they, are, seeking., Alphabetic, systems, are, simple, to, grasp, and, familiar, in, everyday, life., This, method, of, organization, is, less, effective, for, short, lists, of, unrelated, things, but, is, powerful, for, long, lists., Continuum, Organization, by, the, quantity, of, a, measured, variable, over, a, range,, such, as, price,, score,, size,, or, weight., Continuum, organization, is, most, effective, when, organizing, many, things, that, are, all, measured, or, scored, the, same, way., Examples, include, rankings, and, reviews, of, all, kinds,, such, as, the, U.S., News, and, World, Report, ranking, of, colleges, and, universities,, the, best, movies, in, a, given, year,, darkest, or, lightest, items,, and, other, instances, where, a, clear, weight, or, value, can, be, assigned, to, each, item., Brainstorming, When, designing, a, new, web, site, or, extensively, overhauling, an, existing, one,, it, can, be, useful, to, step, back, from, the, details, of, the, content, inventory, and, take, a, fresh, look, at, both, how, your, information, is, organized, and, the, underlying, paradigms, that, drive, conversations, about, content, and, site, organization., Some, common, underlying, paradigms, for, site, organization, are:, Identity, sites:, Dominated, by, projected, identity, and, marketing, Navigation, sites:, Dominated, by, navigation, and, links, Novelty, sites:, Dominated, by, news, and, “what’s, new”, The, org, chart, site:, Designed, around, the, organization, of, the, enterprise, Service, sites:, Organized, around, service,, content,, or, products, categories, Flashy, sites:, Use, interaction, and, visual, flash, to, draw, an, audience, Tool-oriented, sites:, Organized, around, the, latest, technology,, such, as, xml,, Ajax,, or, “Web, 2.0”, Some, paradigms, or, mindsets, are, clearly, better, than, others:, it’s, rarely, wise, to, fall, in, love, with, a, particular, technology, before, you, have, a, clear, rationale, for, using, it, or, for, projecting, your, identity, to, the, extent, that, you, ignore, the, motivations, and, concerns, of, your, potential, readers, and, users., However,, good, sites, are, a, balance, of, meeting, your, users’, needs, and, delivering, your, message, to, the, world., There, is, no, formula, for, finding, the, right, organizational, paradigm,, but, in, the, early, planning, you, should, always, examine, your, standing, prejudices, and, explicitly, justify, them., Why, is, it, a, good, idea, to, organize, your, navigation, around, your, business, units?, How, does, that, match, your, users’, needs, and, concerns?, Clumsy, “org, chart, sites”, are, a, standing, joke, among, web, designers,, but, sometimes, users, really, do, want, to, know, how, you, are, organized, and, will, find, services, and, content, more, easily, with, navigation, based, on, business, units., If, you, see, these, underlying, mindsets, driving, or, distorting, early, site, organization, discussions,, put, them, on, the, table, for, discussion, and, brainstorming., Everyone, has, paradigms:, just, be, sure, you’ve, examined, and, chosen, yours, as, the, best, solution, for, your, site., Card, sorting, and, whiteboard, sessions, Even, if, the, major, categories, of, your, content, organization, are, clear, to, the, design, team,, it, still, may, be, hard, to, sort, through, where, each, piece, of, content, belongs, or, what, organization, scheme, will, seem, intuitive, and, predictable, to, your, users., Card, sorting, is, a, common, technique, for, both, creating, and, evaluating, content, organization, and, web, site, structures., In, classic, card-sorting, techniques,, index, cards, are, labeled, with, the, names, of, major, and, secondary, content, categories,, and, individual, team, members, or, potential, site, users, are, then, asked, to, sort, through, the, cards, and, organize, them, in, a, way, that, seems, intuitive, and, logical., Users, may, also, be, asked, to, suggest, new, or, better, names, for, categories., The, resulting, content, outline, from, each, participant, is, recorded,, usually, in, a, spreadsheet,, and, all, the, individual, content, schemes, are, compared, for, commonalities, and, areas, of, major, disagreement., The, best, card-sorting, data, comes, from, individual, sessions, with, representative, current, or, potential, users, of, your, site., If, you, have, enough, participants,, combining, the, results, of, each, card-sorting, session, produces, a, powerful, “wisdom, of, crowds”, aggregation, of, many, individual, judgments, about, what, content, organization, makes, sense., For, smaller, or, less, formal, site, projects, you, can, have, group, whiteboard, sessions, with, techniques, similar, to, card, sorting., Participants, are, asked, to, sort, through, cards, or, sticky, notes, labeled, with, the, names, of, major, content, elements,, which, are, then, posted, on, a, whiteboard, and, sorted, by, the, group, until, there, is, consensus, about, what, overall, organization, makes, the, most, sense., In, most, cases, you’ll, achieve, quick, consensus, on, the, major, categories, of, content, and, navigation,, and, the, whiteboard, organization, becomes, a, useful, first, look, at, the, site, org, chart, that, can, help, the, group, resolve, the, more, problematic, questions, of, what, content, belongs, in, which, category., For, successful, content, organization, sessions,, make, sure, that, you:, Name, the, major, categories, as, clearly, as, possible,, without, duplications, or, redundancies, in, terminology, Have, a, complete, inventory, of, all, your, major, categories, and, subcategories, of, content, Prepare, thorough, instructions, for, individual, card-sorting, sessions, Refrain, from, prompting, or, coaching, individual, participants, Refrain, from, discouraging, ideas,, and, allow, free, brainstorming, Have, plenty, of, supplies, for, new, categories, and, improved, terminology, Bring, a, digital, camera, to, record, the, proposed, organizations, and, whiteboard, layouts, Individual, card-sorting, and, group, whiteboard, sessions, are, fast,, inexpensive, ways, to, create, and, evaluate, your, proposed, site, content, organization., The, techniques, have, been, used, for, many, years,, and, if, you, involve, actual, or, potential, users, of, your, site,, they, offer, “real, world”, validation, of, ideas, from, your, sponsors,, stakeholders,, and, team, members., Chunking, information, Most, information, on, the, World, Wide, Web, is, gathered, in, short, reference, documents, that, are, intended, to, be, read, nonsequentially., This, is, particularly, true, of, sites, where, the, contents, are, mostly, technical, or, administrative, documents., Long, before, the, web, was, invented,, technical, writers, discovered, that, readers, appreciate, short, chunks, of, information, that, can, be, located, and, scanned., This, method, of, presenting, information, translates, well, to, the, web, for, several, reasons:, Few, web, users, read, long, passages, of, text, onscreen., Most, users, save, long, documents, to, disk, or, print, them, for, more, comfortable, reading., Discrete, chunks, of, information, lend, themselves, to, web, links., The, user, of, a, web, link, usually, expects, to, find, a, specific, unit, of, relevant, information,, not, a, book’s, worth, of, general, content., Chunking, can, help, organize, and, present, information, in, a, modular, layout, that, is, consistent, throughout, the, site., This, allows, users, not, only, to, apply, past, experience, with, a, site, to, future, searches, and, explorations, but, also, to, predict, how, an, unfamiliar, section, of, a, web, site, will, be, organized., Concise, chunks, of, information, are, better, suited, to, the, computer, screen,, which, provides, a, limited, view, of, long, documents., Long, web, pages, tend, to, disorient, readers;, they, require, users, to, scroll, long, distances, and, to, remember, what, has, scrolled, off-screen., The, concept, of, a, chunk, of, information, must, be, flexible, and, consistent, with, common, sense,, logical, organization,, and, convenience., Let, the, nature, of, the, content, suggest, how, it, should, be, subdivided, and, organized., Although, short, web, documents, are, usually, preferable,, it, makes, little, sense, to, divide, a, long, document, arbitrarily,, particularly, if, you, want, users, to, be, able, to, print, easily, or, save, the, document, in, one, step., book, contents, chapter, contents, previous, page, next, page, Search:, Books, by, Patrick, J., Lynch, and, Sarah,
