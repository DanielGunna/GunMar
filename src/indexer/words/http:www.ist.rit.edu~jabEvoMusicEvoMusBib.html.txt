[Evolutionary, Music, Bibliography, to, accompany, the, Evolutionary, Music, Tutorial, given, at, GECCO, 2005, This, no-frills, Web, page, provides, links, to, many, of, the, Web, sites, I, reviewed, for, my, tutorial, on, Evolutionary, Music,, which, was, last, given, at, GECCO, 2005, in, Washington,, DC., The, aim, of, the, tutorial, is, to, provide, an, overview, of, how, Evolutionary, Computation, (EC), has, been, applied, to, music,, which, is, getting, to, be, a, big, area,, as, I, discovered, when, I, began, reviewing, what, people, are, doing, (over, 130, papers)., Consequently,, this, bibliography, is, not, complete, or, even, very, comprehensive,, but, it's, a, better, start, than, what, I, could, find, when, I, began, my, review, of, evolutionary, music, systems., I've, organized, the, links, to, be, largely, consistent, with, the, organization, of, the, tutorial, (slides, available, here)., For, each, section,, I've, listed, links, to, the, research, I, directly, cited, first,, followed, by, links, to, similar, research, by, others, that, I, didn't, directly, cite., Again,, this, is, far, from, a, definitive, bibliography, of, every, paper, that, relates, to, EC, in, music., If, you're, aware, of, work, in, this, area, that, is, missing,, please, let, me, know., While, I, don't, intend, to, actively, maintain, this, site, in, perpetuity,, I, am, very, interested, both, in, how, EC, researchers, are, making, music, and, in, how, musicians, are, using, EC,, so, I'll, try, to, add, things, as, time, allows., -, Al, Biles, Greatest, Hits, These, five, references, are, my, picks, as, the, best, places, to, start, reading, in, this, area., Three, of, them, are, available, in, print, form, only,, so, the, links, for, those, are, to, are, to, publishers., The, first, reference, was, published, in, April,, 2007., Very, exciting!, Evolutionary, Computer, Music., Eduardo, Reck, Miranda, and, Al, Biles, (editors),, Springer-Verlag,, 2007., Eduardo, and, I, edited, this, book, with, contributions, from, many, of, the, researchers, whose, work, is, listed, in, this, bibliography., The, tutorial, that, spawned, this, Web, page, forms, the, basis, for, one, of, my, two, chapters,, and, I, contributed, an, evolutionary, improvisation, chapter, as, well., Besides, myself, and, Eduardo,, the, contributers, include, Peter, Beyls,, Tim,

36(1),, April, 2002, and, February, 2003,, respectively., Composition, There, are, scores, of, EC-based, composition, systems, out, there, (pun, intended),, most, of, which, are, in, the, "toy, system", category., I, don't, mean, this, in, a, negative, way;, these, things, are, fun, to, build,, but, they, all, start, looking, alike., Many, are, class, projects, for, EC, or, computer, music, courses., The, typical, toy, system, breeds, a, population, of, simple, melodies, for, review, by, a, mentor, (my, term, for, the, human, evaluator, in, an, interactive, genetic, algorithm, (IGA))., Some, attempt, an, algorithmic, fitness, function., The, musical, results, of, most, of, these, systems, are, not, usually, very, compelling,, but, again,, they, can, be, a, lot, of, fun, to, build., The, links, I'm, providing, are, to, a, diverse, sample, of, early, or, otherwise, noteworthy, examples, of, composition, systems, that, go, beyond, the, "toy", category., Horner, and, Goldberg, (ICMC,, 1991), The, first, paper, to, link, EC, and, music,, specifically, to, perform, thematic, bridging., Given, at, the, International, Computer, Music, Conference, (ICMC)., The, link, is, to,

Interesting, because, of, the, the, emphasis, on, studiying, the, fitness, problem., With, sound, samples., GenDash, (Rodney, Waschka,, II), Noteworthy, because, Prof., Waschka, is, a, serious, composer, first, and, a, technologist, second,, a, rare, person, in, this, area..., This, recent, paper, gives, a, good, overview, of, his, approach., Link, is, to, the, ALMMA, I, workshop;, his, paper, is, the, eighth, one, down., Living, Melodies, (Palle, Dahlstedt, and, Mats, Nordahl), Coevolving, agents, whose, communication, forms, the, basis, for, music., Comprehensive, update, in, Sounds, Unheard, of,, Palle, Dahlstedt's, 2004, dissertation., One, final, historical, note, on, an, early, system, that, had, widespread, Web, exposure., Jeffrey, Putnam, built, a, toy, system, in, the, mid, 90's, that, lots, of, people, still, link, to, (www.nmt.edu/~jefu/bin/get-notes),, despite, the, fact, that, the, URL, has, been, dead, for, several, years., This, was, the, first, of, the, Web-as-a-fitness-function, IGA, music, systems,, and, definitely, was, in, the, right, place, at, the, right, time., In, trying, to, find, where, this, system, ended, up,, I, discovered, that, Dr., Putnam, is, currently, at, Eastern, Washington, U,, and, his, Grammidity, project, has, a, MIDI, manifestation,, albeit, without, a, Web, interface., Harmonization, A, classic, subtask, of, composition,, specifically, four-part, harmonisation, of, a, melody., This, seems, to, be, one, area, where, EC, is, less, effective, than, rule-based, or, algorithmic, techniques., Horner, and, Ayres, (ICMC,, 1995),, the, same, Andrew, Horner, as, above., This, early, effort, was, very, successful,, but, on, a, more, constrained, problem, (chords, were, given)., Phon-Amnuaisuk,, et, al, (1999), compared, a, GA, to, a, rule-based, system, for, four-part, harmonization,, where, only, the, melody, line, was, given., The, GA, came, out, second, best., Rhythm, Another, subtask, of,

accompaniment,, with, some, sound, samples., Fitness, Fitness, is, a, recurring, theme, rather, than, a, separate, topic, in, the, tutorial,, but, these, links, focus, on, what, is, often, the, toughest, single, issue, in, composition, systems., Lots, of, melodic, features, (Towsey, el, al,, 2001), Domain, is, extending, student-generated, melodic, "seeds", in, a, computer-assisted, composition, learning, environment., Along, the, way,, they, catalog, over, 20, melodic, features, suitable, for, fitness, function, fodder., Automated, Fitness, Raters, (Brad, Johanson,, 1997), The,

is, often, overlooked, and, is, often, lumped, in, with, fitness,, but, there's, more, to, listening, that, just, deciding, what's, good, or, bad., variations, (Bruce, Jacob,, 1995), His, "ear",
