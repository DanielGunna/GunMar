Aug, 26,, 2014, Beauty, is, an, important, part, of, our, lives., Ugliness, too., It, is, no, surprise, then, that, philosophers, since, antiquity, have, been, interested, in, our, experiences, of, and, judgments, about, beauty, and, ugliness., They, have, tried, to, understand, the, nature, of, these, experiences, and, judgments,, and, they, have, also, wanted, to, know, whether, these, experiences, and, judgments, were, legitimate., Both, these, projects, took, a, sharpened, form, in, the, 20th, century,, when, this, part, of, our, lives, came, under, a, sustained, attack, in, both, European, and, North, American, intellectual, circles., Much, of, the, discourse, about, beauty, since, the, 18th, century, had, deployed, a, notion, of, the, “aesthetic”,, and, so, that, notion, in, particular, came, in, for, criticism., This, disdain, for, the, aesthetic, may, have, roots, in, a, broader, cultural, Puritanism,, which, fears, the, connection, between, the, aesthetic, and, pleasure., Even, to, suggest,, in, the, recent, climate,, that, an, artwork, might, be, good, because, it, is, pleasurable,, as, opposed, to, cognitively,, morally, or, politically, beneficial,, is, to, court, derision., The, 20th, century, was, not, kind, to, the, notions, of, beauty, or, the, aesthetic., Nevertheless,, there, were, always, some, thinkers, —, philosophers,, as, well, as, others, in, the, study, of, particular, arts, —, who, persisted, in, thinking, seriously, about, beauty, and, the, aesthetic., In, the, first, part, of, this, essay,, we, will, look, at, the, particularly, rich, account, of, judgments, of, beauty, given, to, us, by, Immanuel, Kant., The, notion, of, a, “judgment, of, taste”, is, central, to, Kant's, account, and, also, to, virtually, everyone, working, in, traditional, aesthetics;, so, we, begin, by, examining, Kant's, characterization, of, the, judgment, of, taste., In, the, second, part,, we, look, at, the, issues, that, 20th, century, thinkers, raised., We, end, by, drawing, on, Kant's, account, of, the, judgment, of, taste, to, consider, whether, the, notion, of, the, aesthetic, is, viable., 1., The, Judgment, of, Taste, 1.1, Subjectivity,

of, Taste, What, is, a, judgment, of, taste?, Kant, isolated, two, fundamental, necessary, conditions, for, a, judgment, to, be, a, judgment, of, taste, —, subjectivity, and, universality, (Kant, 1790)., Other, conditions, may, also, contribute, to, what, it, is, to, be, a, judgment, of, taste,, but, they, are, consequential, on,, or, predicated, on,, the, two, fundamental, conditions., In, this, respect, Kant, followed, the, lead, of, Hume, and, other, writers, in, the, British, sentimentalist, tradition, (Hume, 1757)., 1.1, Subjectivity, The, first, necessary, condition, of, a, judgment, of, taste, is, that, it, is, essentially, subjective., What, this, means, is, that, the, judgment, of, taste, is, based, on, a, feeling, of, pleasure, or, displeasure., It, is, this, that, distinguishes, a, judgment, of, taste, from, an, empirical, judgment., Central, examples, of, judgments, of, taste, are, judgments, of, beauty, and, ugliness., (Judgments, of, taste, can, be, about, art, or, nature.), This, subjectivist, thesis, would, be, over-strict, if, it, were, interpreted, in, an, “atomistic”, fashion,, so, that, some, subjective, response, corresponds, to, every, judgment, of, taste,, and, vice, versa., Sometimes, one, makes, a, judgment, of, taste, on, inductive, grounds, or, on, the, basis, of, authority., A, more, holistic, picture, of, the, relation, between, response, and, judgment, preserves, the, spirit, of, the, subjectivist, doctrine, while, fitting, our, actual, lives, more, accurately., The, subjectivist, doctrine, needs, to, be, refined, in, order, to, deal, with, the, cases, of, induction, and, authority., But, it, must, not, be, abandoned., The, doctrine, is, basically, right., However,, it, is, not, obvious, what, to, make, of, the, subjectivity, of, the, judgment, of, taste., We, need, an, account, of, the, nature, of, the, pleasure, on, which, judgments, of, beauty, are, based., Beyond, a, certain, point,, this, issue, cannot, be, pursued, independently, of, metaphysical, issues, about, realism,, for, the, metaphysics, we, favor, is, bound, to, affect, our, view, of, the, nature, of, the, pleasure, we, take, in, beauty., In, particular,, we, need, to, know, whether, or, not, pleasure, in, beauty, represents, properties, of, beauty, and, ugliness., If, not,, does, it, involve, our, cognitive, faculties, in, some, other, way,, as, Kant, thought?, Or, is, it, not, a, matter, of, the, faculties, that, we, deploy, for, understanding, the, world,, but, a, matter, of, sentimental, reactions,, which, are, schooled, in, various, ways,, as, Hume, thought?, These, are, very, hard, questions., But, there, are, some, things, we, can, say, about, the, pleasure, involved, in, finding, something, beautiful, without, raising, the, temperature, too, high., Kant, makes, various, points, about, pleasure, in, the, beautiful,, which, fall, short, of, what, we, might, call, his, “deep”, account, of, the, nature, of, pleasure, in, beauty,, according, to, which, it, is, the, harmonious, free, play, of, imagination, and, understanding., According, to, Kant's, “surface”, account, of, pleasure, in, beauty,, it, is, not, mere, sensuous, gratification,, as, in, the, pleasure, of, sensation,, or, of, eating, and, drinking., Unlike, such, pleasures,, pleasure, in, beauty, is, occasioned, by, the, perceptual, representation, of, a, thing., (These, days,, we, might, feel, more, comfortable, putting, this, by, saying, that, pleasure, in, beauty, has, an, intentional, content.), Moreover,, unlike, other, sorts, of, intentional, pleasures,, pleasure, in, beauty, is, “disinterested”., This, means,, very, roughly,, that, it, is, a, pleasure, that, does, not, involve, desire, —, pleasure, in, beauty, is, desire-free., That, is,, the, pleasure, is, neither, based, on, desire, nor, does, it, produce, one, by, itself., In, this, respect,, pleasure, in, beauty, is, unlike, pleasure, in, the, agreeable,, unlike, pleasure, in, what, is, good, for, me,, and, unlike, pleasure, in, what, is, morally, good., According, to, Kant,, all, such, pleasures, are, “interested”, —, they, are, bound, up, with, desire., It, may, be, that, we, have, desires, concerning, beautiful, things,, as, Kant, allows, in, sections, 41, and, 42, of, the, Critique, of, Judgment,, but, so, long, as, those, desires, are, not, intrinsic, to, the, pleasure, in, beauty,, the, doctrine, that, all, pleasure, is, disinterested, is, undisturbed., (Some, critics, of, Kant, miss, this, point.), This, is, all, important, as, far, as, it, goes,, but, it, is, all, negative., We, need, to, know, what, pleasure, in, beauty, is,, as, well, as, what, it, isn't., What, can, be, said, of, a, more, positive, nature?, 1.2, Normativity, In, order, to, see, what, is, special, about, pleasure, in, beauty,, we, must, shift, the, focus, back, to, consider, what, is, special, about, the, judgment, of, taste., For, Kant,, the, judgment, of, taste, claims, “universal, validity”,, which, he, describes, as, follows:, …, when, [a, man], puts, a, thing, on, a, pedestal, and, calls, it, beautiful,, he, demands, the, same, delight, from, others., He, judges, not, merely, for, himself,, but, for, all, men,, and, then, speaks, of, beauty, as, if, it, were, a, property, of, things., Thus, he, says, that, the, thing, is, beautiful;, and, it, is, not, as, if, he, counts, on, others, agreeing, with, him, in, his, judgment, of, liking, owing, to, his, having, found, them, in, such, agreement, on, a, number, of, occasions,, but, he, demands, this, agreement, of, them., He, blames, them, if, they, judge, differently,, and, denies, them, taste,, which, he, still, requires, of, them, as, something, they, ought, to, have;, and, to, this, extent, it, is, not, open, to, men, to, say:, Every, one, has, his, own, taste., This, would, be, equivalent, to, saying, that, there, is, no, such, thing, as, taste,, i.e., no, aesthetic, judgment, capable, of, making, a, rightful, claim, upon, the, assent, of, all, men., (Kant, 1790,, p., 52;, see, also, pp., 136–139.), Kant's, idea, is, that, in, a, judgment, of, taste,, we, demand, or, require, agreement, from, others, in, a, way, we, do, not, in, our, judgments, about, the, niceness, of, Canary-wine,, which, is, just, a, question, of, individual, preference., In, matters, of, taste, and, beauty,, we, think, that, others, ought, to, share, our, judgment., That's, why, we, blame, them, if, they, don't., It, is, because, the, judgment, of, taste, has, such, an, aspiration, to, universal, validity, that, it, seems, “as, if, [beauty], were, a, property, of, things.”, Now,, if, the, above, quotation, were, all, that, Kant, had, to, say, by, way, of, elucidating, the, judgment, of, taste,, then, he, would, not, have, said, enough., For, the, following, question, is, left, hanging:, why, do, we, require, that, others, share, our, judgment?, We, might, want, others, to, share, our, judgment, for, all, sorts, of, strange, reasons., Maybe, we, will, feel, more, comfortable., Maybe, we, will, win, a, bet., And, if, we, say, that, they, ought, to, judge, a, certain, way,, we, need, to, say, more., In, what, sense, is, this, true?, What, if, someone, cannot, appreciate, some, excellent, work, of, art, because, they, are, grief-stricken?, What, if, it, would, distract, someone, from, some, socially, worthy, project?, Of, what, nature, is, this, “ought”?, We, can, recast, the, point, about, how, we, ought, to, judge, in, austere, terms, by, saying, that, there, is, a, certain, normative, constraint, on, our, judgments, of, taste, that, is, absent, in, our, judgments, about, the, niceness, of, Canary-wine., The, most, primitive, expression, of, this, normativity, is, this:, some, are, correct,, others, incorrect., Or, perhaps,, even, more, cautiously:, some, judgments, are, better, than, others., We, do, not, think, that, something, is, beautiful, merely, to, me,, in, the, way, that, we, might, say, that, some, things, just, happen, to, give, me, sensuous, pleasure., Of, course,, we, might, well, say, “I, think, X, is, beautiful,”, because, we, wish, to, express, uncertainty,, but, where, we, judge, confidently,, we, think, of, our, judgment, as, being, correct., And, that, means, that, we, think, that, the, opposite, judgment, would, be, incorrect., We, assume, that, not, all, judgments, of, beauty, are, equally, appropriate., “Each, to, their, own, taste”, only, applies, to, judgments, of, niceness, and, nastiness,, which, Kant, calls, “judgments, of, agreeableness”, (see, Kant, 1790,, pp., 51–53,, p., 149)., Of, course,, some, people, just, know, about, food, (especially, in, France, and, Italy)., There, are, experts, and, authorities, on, making, delicious, food, and, in, knowing, what, will, taste, good, (Kant, 1790,, pp., 52–53)., But, what, these, people, know, is, what, will, taste, pleasurable, to, a, certain, kind, of, palate., In, a, sense,, some, things, just, do, taste, better, than, others,, and, some, judgments, of, excellence, in, food, are, better, than, others., There, is, a, sense, in, which, some, are, even, correct, and, others, incorrect., But, still,, this, is, only, relative, to, “normal”, human, beings., There, is, no, idea, of, correctness, according, to, which, someone, with, very, unusual, pleasures, and, displeasure, is, at, fault,, or, according, to, which, the, majority, of, human, beings, can, be, wrong., (Kant, says, that, judgments, of, agreeableness, have, “general”, but, not, “universal”, validity;, 1790,, p., 53.), But, in, the, case, of, judgments, of, taste, or, beauty,, correctness, is, not, hostage, to, what, most, people, like, or, judge., To, say, that, a, judgment, of, taste, makes, a, claim, to, correctness, might, seem, merely, to, shift, from, the, problematic, “ought”, that, is, involved, in, a, judgment, of, taste, to, a, problematic, “correctness”, or, “betterness”., This, may, be, inevitable., We, are, dealing, with, a, normative, notion,, and, while, some, normative, notions, may, be, explainable, in, terms, of, others,, we, cannot, express, normative, notions, in, non-normative, terms., In, some, cases, the, correctness, of, a, judgment, of, taste, may, be, impossibly, difficult, to, decide., We, may, even, think, that, there, is, no, right, answer, to, be, had, if, we, are, asked, to, compare, two, very, different, things., But, in, many, other, cases,, we, think, that, there, is, a, right, and, a, wrong, answer, at, which, we, are, aiming,, and, that, our, judgments, can, be, erroneous., If, we, don't, think, this,, in, at, least, some, cases,, then, we, are, not, making, a, judgment, of, taste, —, we, are, doing, something, else., Before, we, move, on,, it, may, be, worth, saying, something, about, “relativism”,, according, to, which, no, judgments, of, taste, are, really, better, than, others., It, is, common, for, people, to, say,, “There, is, no, right, and, wrong, about, matters, of, taste.”, Or, people, will, express, the, same, thought, by, saying, that, beauty, is, “relative”, to, individual, judgment,, or, even, that, it, is, “socially, relative”., Such, relativism, about, value, of, all, sorts, is, part, of, the, Zeitgeist, of, a, certain, recent, Western, cultural, tradition., It, is, part, of, the, intellectual, air,, in, certain, quarters., And, in, particular,, many, intellectuals, have, expressed, a, dislike, of, the, idea, that, judgments, of, taste, really, have, any, normative, claim,, as, if, that, would, be, uncouth, or, oppressive., However,, if, we, are, describing, our, thought, as, it, is,, not, how, some, think, it, ought, to, be,, then, it, is, important, that, philosophers, should, be, persistent, and, insist, —, in, the, face, of, this, Zeitgeist, —, that, normativity, is, a, necessary, condition, of, the, judgment, of, taste., Two, points, ought, to, embarrass, the, relativist., Firstly,, people, who, say, this, kind, of, thing, are, merely, theorizing., In, the, case, of, judgments, of, beauty,, relativist, theory, is, wildly, out, of, step, with, common, practice., As, with, moral, relativism,, one, can, virtually, always, catch, the, professed, relativist, about, judgments, of, beauty, making, and, acting, on, non-relative, judgments, of, beauty, —, for, example,, in, their, judgments, about, music,, nature, and, everyday, household, objects., Relativists, do, not, practice, what, they, preach., Secondly,, one, thing, that, drives, people, to, this, implausible, relativism,, which, is, so, out, of, line, with, their, practice,, is, a, perceived, connection, with, tolerance, or, anti-authoritarianism., This, is, what, they, see, as, attractive, in, it., But, this, is, upside-down., For, if, “it's, all, relative”, and, no, judgment, is, better, than, any, other,, then, relativists, put, their, judgments, wholly, beyond, criticism,, and, they, cannot, err., Only, those, who, think, that, there, is, a, right, and, wrong, in, judgment, can, modestly, admit, that, they, might, be, wrong., What, looks, like, an, ideology, of, tolerance, is,, in, fact,, the, very, opposite., Thus, relativism, is, hypocritical, and, it, is, intolerant., 1.3, Recasting, Normativity, In, the, normative, claim, of, judgments, of, taste,, as, formulated, above,, other, people, do, not, figure, in, the, account., This, is, an, austere, explanation, of, what, Kant, meant,, or, perhaps, of, what, he, ought, to, have, meant,, when, he, said, that, the, judgment, of, taste, claims, “universal, validity”,, by, contrast, with, judgments, about, the, niceness, of, Canary-wine., Given, this, account,, we, can, explain, the, fact, that, we, think, that, others, ought, to, share, our, judgment., They, ought, to, share, it, on, pain, of, making, a, judgment, which, is, incorrect, or, inappropriate., And, this, would, be, why, we, do, in, fact, look, to, others, to, share, our, judgment;, we, don't, want, them, to, make, incorrect, judgments., Kant's, reference, to, other, people, in, characterizing, the, normativity, of, judgments, of, taste, has, dropped, out, of, the, picture, as, inessential., However,, Kant, would, probably, not, go, along, with, this,, for, he, characterizes, the, normativity, in, a, way, that, ties, in, with, his, eventual, explanation, of, its, possibility., Kant, expresses, the, normative, idea, in, a, very, particular, way., He, writes:, [we], insist, on, others, agreeing, with, our, taste, (Kant, 1790,, pp., 53.), And, Kant, says, that, the, judgment, of, taste, involves, a, claim, to, validity, for, all, men…, (Kant, 1790,, p., 51.), By, contrast,, Kant, thinks, that, although, we, sometimes, speak, as, if, our, judgments, of, the, agreeable, are, universally, valid, (“Lamb, tastes, better, with, garlic”),, in, fact, they, are, not:, judgments, of, the, agreeable, appeal, only, to, most, but, not, to, all, men, (Kant, 1790,, pp., 52–53)., However,, the, austere, characterization, attempts, to, catch, a, more, basic, idea, of, normativity, —, one, that, might, serve, as, the, target, of, rival, explanations., As, far, as, explaining, how, subjectively, universal, judgments, are, possible,, Kant, has, a, complicated, story, about, the, harmonious, interplay, of, the, cognitive, faculties, —, imagination, and, understanding, —, which, he, thinks, constitutes, pleasure, in, beauty, (Kant, 1790,, p., 60)., This, “deep”, account, of, pleasure, in, beauty, is, highly, controversial, and, not, particularly, plausible, (see, Budd, 2001)., But, we, can, see, why, Kant, gives, it., For, Kant,, the, normative, claim, of, a, judgment, of, taste, has, its, roots, in, the, more, general, workings, of, our, cognitive, faculties,, which, Kant, thinks, we, can, assume, others, share., Thus, we, have, the, beginnings, of, an, explanation, of, how, such, a, pleasure, can, ground, a, judgment, that, makes, a, universal, claim., However,, Kant, does, not, have, much, to, say, about, the, nature, of, the, “universality”, or, normativity, that, is, being, explained, by, such, a, speculative, account, of, pleasure, in, beauty., It, is, no, accident, that, Kant, phrases, the, obligation, in, interpersonal, terms,, considering, where, he, is, going., And, it, may, be, no, great, fault, on, his, part, that, he, does, so., But, for, our, purposes,, we, need, to, separate, what, is, being, explained, from, its, explanation., For, if, Kant's, explanation, does, not, work,, we, want, to, be, left, with, a, characterization, of, the, normativity, he, was, trying, to, explain., We, need, to, separate, Kant's, problem, from, his, solution,, so, that, the, former, is, left, if, the, latter, fails., Maybe, there, is, an, alternative, solution, to, his, problem., 1.4, Normativity, and, Pleasure, As, described,, normativity, attaches, to, judgments, of, taste, themselves., What, does, this, imply, for, pleasure, in, beauty?, Since, judgments, of, taste, are, based, on, responses, of, pleasure,, it, would, make, little, sense, if, our, judgments, were, more, or, less, appropriate, but, our, responses, were, not., The, normative, claim, of, our, judgments, of, taste, must, derive, from, the, fact, that, we, think, that, some, responses, are, better, or, more, appropriate, to, their, object, than, others., Responses, only, license, judgments, which, can, be, more, or, less, appropriate, because, responses, themselves, can, be, more, or, less, appropriate., If, I, get, pleasure, from, drinking, Canary-wine, and, you, don't,, neither, of, us, will, think, of, the, other, as, being, mistaken., But, if, you, don't, get, pleasure, from, Shakespeare's, Sonnets,, I, will, think, of, you, as, being, in, error, —, not, just, your, judgment,, but, your, liking., I, think, that, I, am, right, to, have, my, response,, and, that, your, response, is, defective., Someone, who, thinks, that, there, is,, in, Hume's, words,, “an, equality, of, genius”, between, some, inferior, composer,, on, the, one, hand,, and, J., S., Bach,, on, the, other,, has, a, defective, sensibility, (Hume, 1757,, p., 230)., Roger, Scruton, puts, the, point, well, when, he, says:, When, we, study, [the, Einstein, Tower, and, the, Giotto, campanile], …, our, attitude, is, not, simply, one, of, curiosity,, accompanied, by, some, indefinable, pleasure, or, satisfaction., Inwardly,, we, affirm, our, preference, as, valid…, (Scruton, 1979,, p., 105)., This, is, the, reason, why, we, demand, the, same, feeling, from, others,, even, if, we, don't, expect, it., We, think, that, our, response, is, more, appropriate, to, its, object, than, its, opposite., And,, in, turn,, this, is, why, we, think, that, our, judgment, about, that, object, is, more, correct, than, its, opposite., The, normativity, of, judgment, derives, from, the, normativity, of, feeling., But, how, can, some, feelings, be, better, or, worse, than, others?, To, answer, this, question,, we, need, to, ask:, how, far, does, the, normativity, of, judgments, of, taste, inhere, in, the, feeling, itself?, The, realist, about, beauty, will, say, that, the, feeling, has, normativity, built, into, it, in, virtue, of, its, representational, content;, the, feelings, themselves, can, be, more, or, less, veridical., Pleasure, in, beauty,, for, example,, has, as, its, object, the, genuine, property, of, beauty;, we, find, the, beauty, pleasurable., A, Humean, sentimentalist, will, probably, say, that, normativity, is, something, we, somehow, construct, or, foist, upon, our, pleasures, and, displeasures,, which, have, no, such, content., And, Kant, has, his, own, account,, which, appeals, to, cognitive, states, that, are, not, beliefs., The, issue, is, controversial., However,, what, we, can, say, for, sure, is, that, it, is, definitive, of, pleasure, in, beauty, that, it, licenses, judgments, that, make, claim, to, correctness., Beyond, this,, there, will, be, theoretical, divergence., This, normativity, is, definitive, of, the, judgment, of, taste,, and, is, its, second, defining, characteristic,, which, we, should, add, to, the, fact, that, it, is, based, on, subjective, grounds, of, pleasure, or, displeasure., 1.5, Judgments, of, Taste, and, the, Big, Question, We, can, sum, things, up, like, this:, judgments, of, taste, occupy, a, mid-point, between, judgments, of, niceness, and, nastiness,, and, empirical, judgments, about, the, external, world., Judgments, of, taste, are, like, empirical, judgments, in, that, they, have, universal, validity,, but, they, are, unlike, empirical, judgment, in, that, they, are, made, on, the, basis, of, an, inner, response., Conversely,, judgments, of, taste, are, like, judgments, of, niceness, or, nastiness, in, that, they, are, made, on, the, basis, of, an, inner, subjective, response, or, experience,, but, they, are, unlike, judgments, of, niceness, and, nastiness,, which, make, no, claim, to, universal, validity., To, cut, the, distinctions, the, other, way:, in, respect, of, normativity,, judgments, of, taste, are, like, empirical, judgments, and, unlike, judgments, of, niceness, or, nastiness,, but, in, respect, of, subjectivity,, judgments, of, taste, are, unlike, empirical, judgments, and, like, judgments, of, niceness, or, nastiness., So, we, have, a, three-fold, division:, empirical, judgments,, judgments, of, taste,, and, judgments, of, niceness, or, nastiness., And, judgments, of, taste, have, the, two, points, of, similarity, and, dissimilarity, on, each, side, just, noted., As, Kant, recognized, (more, or, less, following, Hume),, all, this, is, a, point, from, which, to, theorize., The, hard, question, is, whether,, and, if, so, how,, such, a, subjectively, universal, judgment, is, possible., On, the, face, of, it,, the, two, characteristics, are, in, tension, with, each, other., Our, puzzle, is, this:, what, must, be, the, nature, of, pleasure, in, beauty, if, the, judgments, we, base, on, it, can, make, claim, to, correctness?, This, is, the, Big, Question, in, aesthetics., Kant, set, the, right, agenda, for, aesthetics., His, problem, was, the, right, one,, even, if, his, solution, was, not., However,, our, hope, thus, far, has, been, to, get, clearer, about, what, it, is, that, is, under, scrutiny, in, this, debate., Once, we, are, armed, with, a, modest, account, of, what, a, judgment, of, taste, is,, we, can, then, proceed, to, more, ambitious, questions, about, whether, or, not, judgments, of, taste, represent, real, properties, of, beauty, and, ugliness., We, can, even, consider, whether, or, not, our, whole, practice, of, making, judgments, of, taste, is, defective, and, should, be, jettisoned., But, first, things, first., 2., Other, Features, of, Aesthetic, Judgments, There, is, more, to, aesthetic, judgment, than, just, subjectivity, and, normativity,, and, this, should, be, described, more, fully., The, following, is, a, survey, of, a, number, of, other, candidate, features, of, aesthetic, judgments:, truth,, mind-independence,, nonaesthetic, dependence,, and, laws., 2.1, Aesthetic, Truth, The, normativity, of, aesthetic, judgments, can, be, recast, in, terms, of, a, particular, conception, of, aesthetic, truth., For, some, purposes,, it, is, useful, to, do, this., It, might, be, thought, that, deploying, the, idea, of, aesthetic, truth, commits, one, to, the, existence, of, an, aesthetic, reality., But, this, worry, springs, from, the, assumption, that, a, strong, correspondence, conception, of, truth, is, all, there, ever, is, to, truth, in, any, area, where, we, might, employ, the, notion., In, many, areas, —, scientific, and, psychological, thought,, for, example, —, a, strong, correspondence, conception, of, truth, is, likely, to, be, in, question., However,, the, conception, of, truth, applicable, in, aesthetics, might, be, one, according, to, which, truth, only, implies, the, sort, of, normativity, described, above,, according, to, which, there, are, correct, and, incorrect, judgments, of, taste,, or, at, least, that, some, judgments, are, better, than, others., If, we, deploy, the, notion, of, truth,, we, can, express, the, normative, idea, by, saying, if, a, judgment, is, true, then, its, opposite, is, false., Or, we, can, say, that, the, law, of, non-contradiction, applies, to, aesthetic, judgments:, there, are, some, aesthetic, judgments, such, that, they, and, their, negations, cannot, both, be, true., This, principle, need, not, hold, of, all, judgments, of, taste,, so, long, as, it, holds, of, a, significant, proportion, of, them., Such, a, normative, conception, of, truth, is, stronger, than, a, notion, of, truth, which, is, merely, a, device, for, “semantic, assent”;, that, is,, normative, truth, is, more, than, thin, “disquotational”, truth., Even, judgments, of, the, agreeable,, about, the, niceness, of, Canary-wine,, can, have, access, to, an, inconsequential, disquotational, conception, of, truth., We, can, say, “'Canary-wine, is, nice', is, true, if, and, only, if, Canary-wine, is, nice”, without, raising, the, metaphysical, temperature., However,, judgments, about, the, niceness, of, Canary-wine, do, not, aspire, to, a, normative, conception, of, truth., There, are, no, right, and, wrong, answers, to, the, question, of, whether, Canary-wine, really, is, nice., And, so,, of, neither, the, judgment, that, it, is, nice, nor, the, judgment, that, it, is, not, nice, can, it, be, said, that, if, it, is, true, then, its, opposite, is, false., But, this, is, what, we, do, say, of, some, aesthetic, judgments., However,, although, we, can, cast, aesthetic, normativity, in, terms, of, truth,, we, need, not, do, so., Aesthetic, “truth”,, in, fact,, adds, little, to, the, notion, of, correctness, that, we, have, already, encountered., We, can, do, without, the, word, “true”., We, can, say, that, something, cannot, both, be, beautiful, and, ugly, (in, the, same, respect, at, the, same, time),, and, that, if, something, is, beautiful, then, it, is, not, ugly, (in, the, same, respect, at, the, same, time)., [What, Mary, Mothersill, calls, her, “Second, Thesis”, in, her, book, Beauty, Restored, is, the, thesis, that, a, judgment, of, taste,, such, as, “Beethoven's, first, Rasumovsky, quartet, …, is, beautiful, (has, artistic, merit)”, (p., 145), “is, a, ‘genuine’, judgment”, (p., 146)., However,, as, she, realizes,, we, then, need, to, know, what, makes, a, judgment, a, genuine, judgment., She, mentions, truth,, but, wisely, does, not, stop, there., What, she, then, adds, in, order, to, explain, this, are, various, normative, characteristics,, such, as, the, aspiration, to, correctness, (pp., 157–170)., So, in, the, end, her, view, on, this, matter, converges, with, the, normative, idea, already, described.], 2.2, Mind-dependence, and, Nonaesthetic, Dependence, Given, an, understanding, of, the, normativity, of, judgments, of, taste, —, which, we, might, or, might, not, express, in, terms, of, aesthetic, truth, —, we, can, and, should, add, some, more, sophisticated, normative, features,, which, are, also, important., One, such, feature, is, mind-independence., Mind-independence, is, best, expressed, as, a, negative, thesis:, whether, something, is, beautiful, does, not, depend, on, my, judgment., Thinking, it, so, doesn't, make, it, so., This, can, be, re-expressed, in, conditional, terms:, it, is, not, the, case, that, if, I, think, something, is, beautiful, then, it, is, beautiful., This, is, common, sense., For, example,, we, tend, to, think, that, our, judgments, have, improved, since, we, were, younger., We, think, that, some, of, our, past, judgments, were, in, error., So, thinking, it, so,, at, that, time,, did, not, make, it, so., We, also, think, that, beauty,, ugliness, and, other, aesthetic, properties, depend, on, nonaesthetic, properties., Dependence, contrasts, with, mind-independence, in, that, it, says, what, aesthetic, properties, do, depend, on,, as, opposed, to, what, they, don't, depend, on;, the, aesthetic, properties, of, a, thing, depend, on, its, nonaesthetic, properties., This, dependence, relation, implies, (but, is, not, identical, with), the, supervenience, relation, or, relations:, (a), two, aesthetically, unlike, things, must, also, be, nonaesthetically, unlike;, (b), something, couldn't, change, aesthetically, unless, it, also, changed, nonaesthetically;, and, (c), something, could, not, have, been, aesthetically, different, unless, it, were, also, nonaesthetically, different., These, are,, respectively:, cross-object, supervenience,, cross-time, supervenience,, and, cross-world, supervenience., (“Supervenience”, has, often, been, discussed, under, the, heading, of, “dependence”, but, actually, they, are, distinct, relations,, related, in, a, complex, way.), Sibley's, papers, “Aesthetic, Concepts”, and, “Aesthetic/Nonaesthetic”, were, pioneering, discussions, of, the, dependence, of, the, aesthetic, on, the, nonaesthetic, (Sibley, 1959,, 1965)., Some, have, argued, that, what, aesthetic, properties, depend, on, (their, “dependence, base”), extends, beyond, the, intrinsic, physical, and, sensory, features, of, the, object, of, aesthetic, assessment, (Walton, 1970)., The, nonaesthetic, dependence, base,, Walton, thinks,, always, includes, “contextual, properties”, —, matters, to, do, with, the, origin, of, the, work, of, art,, or, other, works, of, art., Others, dispute, this, (Zangwill, 1999)., This, is, one, aspect, of, the, debate, over, formalism., However,, this, issue, need, not, concern, us, here., The, important, thing, is, that, some, dependence, thesis, holds., The, controversial, question, is, about, the, extent, of, the, dependence, base, of, aesthetic, properties,, not, whether, aesthetic, properties, have, some, nonaesthetic, dependence, base., This, claim, is, very, intuitive,, but, let, us, try, to, say, something, more, in, support, of, it., It, seems, to, be, a, deep, fact, about, beauty, and, other, aesthetic, properties, that, they, are, inherently, “sociable”;, beauty, cannot, be, lonely., Something, cannot, be, barely, beautiful;, if, something, is, beautiful, then, it, must, be, in, virtue, of, its, nonaesthetic, properties., Furthermore,, realizing, this, is, a, constraint, on, our, judgments, of, beauty, and, other, aesthetic, properties., We, cannot, just, judge, that, something, is, beautiful;, we, must, judge, that, it, is, beautiful, in, virtue, of, its, nonaesthetic, properties., In, fact,, we, usually, do, so,, and, not, to, do, so, is, bizarre., (Even, in, cases, of, testimony,, we, hold, that, the, aesthetic, properties, of, a, thing, hold, in, virtue, of, nonaesthetic, properties, that, the, aesthetic, expert, knows.), Of, course,, we, might, not, have, in, mind, every, single, nonaesthetic, property, of, the, thing,, nor, exactly, how, the, nonaesthetic, properties, produce, their, aesthetic, effect., But, we, think, that, certain, nonaesthetic, properties, are, responsible, for, the, aesthetic, properties, and, that, without, those, nonaesthetic, properties,, the, aesthetic, properties, would, not, have, been, instantiated., Beauty, does, not, float, free,, and, recognizing, this, is, constitutive, of, aesthetic, thought., Our, aesthetic, thought,, therefore,, is, fundamentally, different, from, our, thought, about, colors,, with, which, it, is, often, compared., Perhaps, colors, are, tied, in, some, intimate, way, to, intrinsic, or, extrinsic, physical, properties, of, the, surfaces, of, things,, such, as, reflectance, properties., But, color, thought, does, not, presuppose, this., Someone, might, even, think, that, colors, are, bare, properties, of, things., But, one, cannot, think, that, beauty, is, bare;, it, is, essential, to, aesthetic, thought, to, realize, that, the, aesthetic, properties, of, a, thing, arise, from, its, nonaesthetic, properties., The, principles, of, correctness,, mind-independence, and, dependence, can, be, phrased, in, the, property, mode, or, in, terms, of, truth., We, can, cast, them, either, way., We, can, say, that, whether, something, is, beautiful, does, not, depend, on, what, we, think, about, it,, but, it, does, depend, on, its, nonaesthetic, features., Or, we, can, equally, well, say, that, the, truth, of, aesthetic, judgments, is, independent, of, our, aesthetic, judgments, but, it, is, dependent, on, nonaesthetic, truths., Semantic, ascent, changes, little., 2.3, Dependence, and, Laws, Thus, far, we, have, been, making, positive, claims, about, features, of, aesthetic, judgments., Let, us, now, consider, the, claim, that, there, are, no, interesting, nonaesthetic-to-aesthetic, laws,, rules, or, principles,, and, the, claim, that, aesthetic/nonaesthetic, dependence, relation, can, obtain,, even, though, there, are, no, such, interesting, laws,, rules, or, principles., By, “interesting”, laws, of, taste, we, mean, generalizations, to, the, effect, that, anything, of, such, and, such, a, nonaesthetic, kind, is, of, such, and, such, aesthetic, kind,, and, these, generalizations, can, be, used, to, predict, aesthetic, properties, on, the, basis, of, knowledge, of, nonaesthetic, properties., In, this, sense,, many, find, it, plausible, that, there, are, no, laws, of, taste, and, aesthetic, properties, are, anomalous., The, problem, of, the, source, of, correctness, in, aesthetic, judgment, is, independent, of, the, question, of, whether, there, are, laws,, rules, or, principles, of, taste., There, is, no, reason, to, think, that, the, possibility, of, correct, or, true, judgments, depends, on, the, existence, of, laws,, rules, or, principles, from, which, we, can, deduce, our, correct, or, true, judgments., (For, this, reason,, it, is, difficult, to, be, gripped, by, the, central, puzzle, of, Mary, Mothersill's, Beauty, Restored, —, which, is, how, there, can, be, aesthetic, truths, without, aesthetic, laws, —, although, this, problem, is, perhaps, a, cousin, of, the, problem, that, Hume, and, Kant, think, is, central.), Nevertheless, the, anomalousness, of, aesthetics, is, worth, thinking, about, in, its, own, right., Many, aestheticians, agree, that, the, aesthetic, is, anomalous, in, the, above, sense., But, they, are, not, agreed, on, the, explanation, of, anomalousness., A, notable, exception, is, Monroe, Beardsley,, who, claims, —, heroically, and, extraordinarily, —, that, there, are, exactly, three, aesthetic, principles:, things, are, aesthetically, excellent, either, by, being, unified, or, intense, or, complex, (Beardsley, 1958,, chapter, XI)., However,, Beardsley's, 'trinitarian', position, faces, a, difficulty, similar, to, that, faced, by, moral, philosophers, who, appeal, to, “thick”, concepts., If, Beardsley, insists, on, a, lawlike, connection, between, his, three, thick, substantive, aesthetic, properties, (unity,, intensity, and, complexity), and, aesthetic, value,, he, can, only, do, so, at, the, cost, of, conceding, anomalousness, between, the, three, thick, substantive, aesthetic, properties, and, nonaesthetic, properties., There, are, three, layers, and, one, can, hold, onto, laws, between, the, top, and, middle, layers, only, by, losing, laws, between, the, middle, and, bottom, layers., Maybe, intensity, is, always, aesthetically, good,, but, there, are, no, laws, about, what, makes, things, intense., Granting, the, anomalousness, of, aesthetic, properties,, then,, we, need, to, explain, it., There, is, great, plausibility, in, Hume, and, Kant's, suggestion, that, what, explains, the, anomalousness, of, the, aesthetic, is, the, first, feature, of, judgments, of, taste, —, that, judgments, of, taste, are, essentially, subjective,, unlike, ordinary, empirical, judgments, about, physical,, sensory,, or, semantic, properties, (Hume, 1757,, pp., 231–232;, Kant, 1790,, pp., 55–56,, pp., 136–142)., This, is, why, the, two, sorts, of, concepts, are, not, “nomologically, made, for, each, other”, (as, Donald, Davidson, says, about, mental, and, physical, concepts, (Davidson, 1980))., How, can, we, bring, an, essentiallly, subjective, range, of, judgments, nomologically, into, line, with, a, range, of, empirical, judgments?, The, two, answer, to, quite, different, sets, of, constraints., Frank, Sibley, observed, that, aesthetic, concepts, are, not, positively, “condition-governed”, (Sibley, 1959)., And, Mary, Mothersill, claimed, that, there, are, no, laws, of, taste., But, neither, did, much, to, explain, those, facts., The, appeal, to, subjectivity, explains, what, Sibley, and, Mothersill, notice, and, describe., Indeed, Mothersill, writes, of, her, “First, Thesis”, (FT), that, there, are, no, genuine, principles, or, laws, of, taste:, “…FT, is, central, to, aesthetics,, and, there, is,, as, far, as, I, can, see,, nothing, more, fundamental, from, which, it, could, be, derived”, (Mothersill, 1984,, p., 143)., But, it, seems, that, it, can, be, derived, from, the, subjectivity, of, judgments, of, taste., This, kind, of, anomalousness, is, one, thing,, dependence, or, supervenience, another., Even, though, aesthetic, properties, are, anomalous,, they, depend, and, supervene, on, nonaesthetic, properties., Many, find, such, a, combination, of, relations, uncomfortable, outside, aesthetics,, such, as, in, moral, philosophy, and, the, philosophy, of, mind., Yet, there, seem, to, be, good, reasons, to, embrace, both, principles, in, aesthetics., Both, are, firmly, rooted, in, ordinary, aesthetic, thought., 2.4, The, Primacy, of, Correctness, Aesthetic, judgments, have, certain, essential, features,, and, corresponding, to, those, features, are, certain, principles., We, can, group, correctness,, mind-independence,, and, nonaesthetic, dependence, together., However,, it, does, no, harm, to, focus, on, the, feature, of, correctness, or, universal, validity, for, this, is, the, most, basic, of, the, features., If, aesthetic, judgments, did, not, claim, correctness, or, universal, validity,, they, could, not, claim, the, other, features., If, explaining, correctness, or, universal, validity, is, a, problem,, then, so, is, explaining, mind-independence, and, dependence., But, clearly, there, is, a, problem, about, explaining, all, three, features., Why, does, our, aesthetic, thought, have, these, three, features, and, thus, operate, according, to, these, three, principles?, And, what, is, the, source, of, the, right, of, aesthetic, judgments, to, them?, Hume, and, Kant, spend, much, mental, effort, on, these, questions., These, presuppositions, of, aesthetic, judgments, need, to, be, explained, and, justified., Given, that, our, aesthetic, judgments, have, these, commitments,, we, need, to, know, how, such, judgments, are, possible,, how, they, are, actual,, and, how, they, are, legitimate., Having, described, and, analyzed,, as, we, have, done, here,, we, need, to, explain, and, justify., But,, as, noted, earlier,, we, first, need, a, good, description, of, what, we, are, trying, to, explain, and, justify., 2.5, Disinterestedness, An, idea, that, plays, a, large, role, in, Kant's, discussion, of, the, subjective, universality, of, the, judgment, of, taste, is, that, of, disinterestedness,, and, so, some, words, about, this, idea, are, in, order., Kant, claims, that, (a), pleasure, in, the, beautiful, is, “disinterested”,, and, (b), only, pleasure, in, the, beautiful, is, “disinterested”, (Kant, 1790,, pp., 42–50)., This, plays, a, large, role, in, Kant's, project,, for, Kant, connects, disinterestedness, with, the, claim, to, universal, validity, of, the, judgment, of, taste., However,, before, we, go, any, further, is, crucial, to, recognize, that, the, German, word, “interesse”, has, a, special, meaning, in, 18th, century, German,, and, should, not, be, confused, with, similar, sounding, English, words, or, even, contemporary, German, words., For, Kant, an, interesse, means, a, kind, of, pleasure, that, is, not, connected, with, desire;, it, is, neither, grounded, in, desire,, nor, does, it, produce, it., We, should, distinguish, Kant's, ambitious, thesis, that, only, pleasure, in, the, beautiful, is, disinterested, from, his, less, ambitious, claim, simply, that, pleasure, in, the, beautiful, is, disinterested, —, for, it, seems, that, there, could, in, principle, be, other, disinterested, pleasures., The, less, ambitious, claim,, however,, is, controversial, enough., The, more, uncontroversial, component, of, that, less, ambitious, claim, is, that, pleasure, in, the, beautiful, is, not, grounded, in, the, satisfaction, of, desire., It, is, plausible,, surely,, that, when, we, take, pleasure, in, something, we, find, beautiful,, this, is, not, pleasure, in, the, thought, that, we, have, got, something, that, we, desire., Moreover,, Kant, wants, pleasure, in, the, beautiful, to, be, open, to, all, (so, there, should, be, no, “aesthetic, luck”),, and, if, desire, varied, from, person, to, person,, depending, on, what, they, happen, to, desire,, it, seems, that, we, could, not, require, that, pleasure, from, everyone,, as, the, idea, of, universal, validity, requires., Hence, the, claim, to, universal, validity, would, be, lost, if, pleasure, in, beauty, were, not, disinterested, in, the, sense, of, not, being, based, on, desire., However,, it, is, not, so, clear, that, pleasure, in, the, beautiful, cannot, produce, desire,, which, Kant, requires, for, a, pleasure, to, be, disinterested., The, issue, here, is, whether, the, pleasure, can, produce, desire, from, itself., Kant, admits, that, we, have, certain, general, concerns, with, beauty, that, mean, that, desire, may, follow, from, a, judgment, of, beauty,, but, according, to, Kant,, such, desires, do, not, have, their, source, solely, in, the, pleasure, in, the, beautiful, (Kant, 1790,, pp., 154–162,, on, “empirical, interest”, and, “intellectual, interest”)., So, the, less, ambitious, thesis, is, controversial, because, of, the, second, component., Moreover,, whether, only, pleasure, in, beauty, is, disinterested,, and, no, other, kind, of, pleasures, are, disinterested, —, the, ambitious, thesis, —, is, even, more, controversial., These, are, live, issues., Kant's, views, have, much, to, be, said, for, them., But, Hume, would, probably, deny, Kant's, separation, of, pleasure, in, beauty, from, the, motivations, that, lead, us, to, act., In, his, Genealogy, of, Morals,, Frederich, Nietzsche, targets, Kant's, separation, of, pleasure, in, beauty, from, desire,, a, separation, that, is, designed, to, make, beauty, available, to, all, human, beings, (Nietzsche, 1998)., (This, criticism, is, distinct, from, the, criticism, of, the, idea, that, judgements, of, beauty, are, valid, for, all, human, beings.), Nietzsche, protests, at, seeing, pleasure, in, beauty, as, cut-off, from, the, particularities, and, idiosyncrasies, of, our, passionate, lives., It, is, not, clear, who, is, right, here., The, nub, of, the, issue, is, the, nature, of, pleasure, in, the, beautiful., Does, it, have, its, source, in, what, Human, beings, share,, or, in, what, distinguishes, them?, Kant, might, argue,, against, a, Hume, or, a, Nietzsche,, that, seeing, pleasure, in, beauty, as, springing, from, what, varies, between, people,, not, only, places, people, at, the, mercy, of, their, good, or, bad, aesthetic, 'upbringing',, but, also, makes, untenable, the, normative, claims, to, correctness, or, universal, validity, that, are, part, of, judgements, of, beauty,, as, we, ordinarily, conceive, of, them., If, judgements, of, beauty, were, based, on, variable, pleasures, or, displeasures, then, it, seems, that, the, claim, to, correctness, is, fraudulent., But, this, only, follows, if, we, follow, Kant, in, locating, pleasure, in, beauty,, and, our, right, to, make, judgements, of, beauty,, in, the, cognitive, faculties, that, all, human, beings, share., For, Kant,, there, is, an, aesthetic, 'ought', binding, all, human, beings, because, we, all, have, the, cognitive, faculties, that, it, takes, to, have, the, pleasure, in, question., But, this, is, not, the, only, conceivable, source, of, the, aesthetic, 'ought'., One, non-Kantian, answer, would, be, to, locate, the, source, of, normativity, of, aesthetic, judgement,, in, the, world,, not, in, what, Human, beings, share., This, would, be, to, invoke, a, kind, of, 'aesthetic, realism',, whereby, beauty, and, ugliness, are, genuine, properties, of, the, world., This, would, not, suit, Hume,, but, might, in, principle, be, available, to, Nietzsche., 3., The, Notion, of, the, Aesthetic, 3.1, The, Problem,, and, Some, Terminological, Remarks, Let, us, now, turn, to, the, contemporary, notion, of, the, aesthetic., The, predicate, “aesthetic”, can, qualify, many, different, kinds, of, things:, judgments,, experiences,, concepts,, properties,, or, words., It, is, probably, best, to, take, aesthetic, judgments, as, central., We, can, understand, other, aesthetic, kinds, of, things, in, terms, of, aesthetic, judgments:, aesthetic, properties, are, those, that, are, ascribed, in, aesthetic, judgments;, aesthetic, experiences, are, those, that, ground, aesthetic, judgments;, aesthetic, concepts, are, those, that, are, deployed, in, aesthetic, judgments;, and, aesthetic, words, are, those, that, have, the, function, of, being, used, in, the, linguistic, expression, of, aesthetic, judgments., The, most, common, contemporary, notion, of, an, aesthetic, judgment, would, take, judgments, of, beauty, and, ugliness, as, paradigms, —, what, we, called, “judgments, of, taste”, in, part, 1., And, it, excludes, judgments, about, physical, properties,, such, as, shape, and, size,, and, judgments, about, sensory, properties,, such, as, colors, and, sounds., However,, in, addition, to, judgments, of, beauty, and, ugliness,, the, contemporary, notion, of, an, aesthetic, judgment, is, typically, used, to, characterize, a, class, of, judgments, that, also, includes, judgments, of, daintiness,, dumpiness,, delicacy, and, elegance., In, this, respect,, the, contemporary, notion, seems, to, be, broader, than, Kant's,, since, he, focused, just, on, judgments, of, beauty, and, ugliness., However,, there, is, also, a, respect, in, which, the, contemporary, notion, seems, to, be, narrower, than, Kant's, notion., For, Kant, used, the, notion, to, include, both, judgments, of, beauty, (or, of, taste), as, well, as, judgments, of, the, agreeable, —, for, instance,, the, judgment, that, Canary-wine, is, nice, (Kant, 1790,, pp., 41–42, and, p., 54)., But, the, modern, notion,, unlike, Kant's,, excludes, judgments, of, the, agreeable., The, contemporary, notion, also, excludes, judgments, about, pictorial, and, semantic, content, of, a, work, of, art., For, example,, although, the, judgment, that, a, painting, represents, a, flower, might, be, “relevant”, to, an, aesthetic, judgment, about, it,, it, is, not, itself, an, aesthetic, judgment., The, question, is:, is, the, contemporary, classification, 'aesthetic', arbitrary?, What, is, it, that, distinguishes, judgments, as, aesthetic?, What, do, they, have, in, common?, And, how, do, they, differ, from, other, kinds, of, judgment?, Do, these, judgments, form, a, well-behaved, kind?, Incidentally,, it, may, be, worth, mentioning, that, the, notion, of, an, aesthetic, judgment, should, obviously, not, be, elucidated, in, terms, of, the, idea, of, a, work, of, art;, we, make, aesthetic, judgments, about, nature, and, we, make, nonaesthetic, judgments, about, works, of, art., I, take, this, to, be, uncontroversial, (although, apparently, Hegel, denies, it)., The, articulation, and, defense, of, the, notion, of, the, aesthetic, in, modern, times, is, associated, with, Monroe, Beardsley, (1958,, 1982), and, Frank, Sibley, (1959,, 1965)., But, their, work, was, attacked, by, George, Dickie,, Ted, Cohen, and, Peter, Kivy, among, others, (Dickie, 1965,, Cohen, 1973,, Kivy, 1975)., Beardsley, claimed,, somewhat, heroically,, that, aesthetic, experience, is, distinguished, by, its, unity,, intensity, and, complexity., Dickie, argued,, in, reply,, that, such, characteristics, were, either, not, plausibly, necessary, conditions, of, aesthetic, experience,, or, else, that, Beardsley's, description, of, them, was, inadequate., Part, of, Dickie's, attack, was, completely, beside, the, point,, since, he, confused, aesthetic, experiences, with, the, experiences, of, works, of, art;, the, fact, that, some, experiences, of, works, of, art, are, not, as, Beardsley, describes, is, irrelevant., But, it, cannot, be, denied, that, Dickie, was, right, that, even, if, the, problems, of, characterizing, the, three, features, were, resolved,, it, would, still, not, be, plausible, that, the, three, Beardsleyian, features, are, necessary, (or, sufficient), conditions, of, aesthetic, experience., Nevertheless,, all, that, would, show, would, be, that, Beardsley's, account, of, the, aesthetic, is, inadequate., That, Beardsley's, extraordinary, and, heroic, trinitarian, doctrine, cannot, be, maintained, does, not, mean, that, the, notion, of, the, aesthetic, should, be, abandoned., That, would, be, a, flawed, induction, from, a, single, instance., Sibley, claimed, that, the, discernment, of, aesthetic, properties, requires, a, special, sensitivity,, whereas, the, discernment, of, nonaesthetic, properties, could, be, achieved, by, anyone, with, normal, eyes, and, ears., Furthermore, Sibley, claimed, that, it, was, distinctive, of, aesthetic, terms, or, concepts, that, they, were, not, “condition-governed”,, in, the, sense, that, they, had, no, nonaesthetic, positive, criteria, for, their, application., He, thought, of, the, faculty, of, taste, as, special, mental, faculty,, possessed, by, people, with, a, special, sensitivity., This, account, of, the, aesthetic, was, inadvisable,, since, it, allowed, critics, like, Cohen, and, Kivy, to, argue, that, ascribing, aesthetic, properties, did, not, in, fact, require, a, special, faculty,, since, anyone, can, distinguish, a, graceful, line, from, an, ungraceful, line., Moreover,, some, aesthetic, ascriptions,, such, as, elegance,, do, seem, to, be, nonaesthetically, 'condition-governed',, in, Sibley's, sense., Nevertheless, —, once, again, —, that, Sibley's, positive, account, of, the, aesthetic, is, implausible, should, not, lead, us, to, despair, about, the, aesthetic., On, the, other, hand,, the, pessimistic, induction,, now, with, two, instances, under, its, belt,, is, perhaps, looking, a, little, less, unhealthy, —, especially, given, two, such, distinguished, exponents., Despite, this,, Sibley, was, surely, minimally, right, to, think, that, ascribing, aesthetic, properties, to, a, thing, requires, more, than, merely, knowing, its, nonaesthetic, properties., Whether, or, not, it, is, distinctively, difficult,, erudite,, sophisticated, or, non-condition-governed,, aesthetic, understanding, is, something, over, and, above, nonaesthetic, understanding., So, perhaps, we, should, keep, on, trying, to, articulate, the, notion, of, the, aesthetic,, or, at, least, a, useful, notion, of, the, aesthetic., 3.2, The, Hierarchical, Proposal, One, strategy, is, the, following., Begin, with, the, account, of, what, it, is, to, be, a, judgment, of, taste,, or, of, beauty, and, ugliness,, that, was, outlined, in, part, 1,, and, then, use, that, to, elucidate, the, broader, notion, of, an, aesthetic, judgment., To, recall,, it, was, argued, that, Kant, was, right,, with, qualifications,, to, think, that, the, crucial, thing, about, the, judgment, of, taste, is, that, it, has, what, he, calls, “subjective, universality”;, judgments, of, taste, are, those, that, are, (a), based, on, responses, of, pleasure, or, displeasure,, and, (b), claim, universal, validity,, where, that, can, be, minimally, interpreted, as, a, normative, aspiration., The, present, strategy, is, to, use, this, Kantian, account, in, order, to, ground, a, wider, category, of, the, aesthetic,, which, includes, judgments, of, taste, along, with, judgments, of, daintiness,, dumpiness,, delicacy,, elegance,, and, the, rest., Let, us, call, judgments, of, taste,, or, judgments, of, beauty, and, ugliness,, “verdictive, aesthetic, judgments”,, and, let, us, call, the, other, aesthetic, judgments, (of, daintiness,, dumpiness,, elegance,, delicacy,, etc.), “substantive, aesthetic, judgments”., The, idea, is, that, these, substantive, judgments, are, aesthetic, in, virtue, of, a, special, close, relation, to, verdictive, judgments, of, taste,, which, are, subjectively, universal., (We, can, assume, that, judgments, of, beauty, and, ugliness, coincide, with, judgments, of, aesthetic, merit, and, demerit., However,, even, if, beauty, were, taken, to, be, a, substantive, aesthetic, notion,, like, elegance,, delicacy, or, daintiness,, there, would, remain, some, other, overarching, notion, of, aesthetic, merit, or, excellence,, and, we, could, take, that, notion, as, central.), On, this, approach,, judgments, of, daintiness,, dumpiness,, delicacy, and, elegance, stand, in, a, special, and, intimate, relation, to, judgments, of, beauty, and, ugliness, (or, aesthetic, merit, and, demerit),, and, it, is, only, in, virtue, of, this, intimate, relation, that, we, can, think, of, all, these, judgments, as, belonging, to, the, same, category., Now,, what, exactly, is, this, special, intimate, relation, between, verdictive, and, substantive, aesthetic, judgments?, Firstly,, substantive, judgments, describe, ways, of, being, beautiful, or, ugly, (Burton, 1992,, Zangwill, 1995)., It, is, part, of, what, it, is, for, a, thing, to, be, elegant,, delicate, or, dainty, that, it, is, beautiful, in, a, particular, way., And, secondly,, it, is, part, of, the, meaning, of, substantive, aesthetic, judgments, that, they, imply, verdictive, aesthetic, judgments., This, is, the, hierarchical, proposal., [Remark:, this, may, not, be, true, of, words, like, “dainty”, and, “delicate”,, but, it, is, true, of, the, particular, substantive, judgments, that, we, linguistically, express, in, such, words, on, particular, occasions., Both, Beardsley, and, Sibley, seem, to, have, made, the, mistake, of, casting, these, issues, at, the, linguistic, level, rather, than, at, the, level, of, thought;, they, should, have, focused, not, on, aesthetic, words, but, on, aesthetic, judgments, and, responses., (Sibley, did, say, in, footnote, 1, of, Sibley, 1959, that, he, was, concerned, with, “uses”, of, aesthetic, words,, but, he, and, everyone, else, ignored, that, qualification.)], Let, us, now, see, how, this, hierarchical, proposal, works., Consider, an, abstract, pattern, of, curving, lines,, which, is, elegant., It, might, be, necessary, that, that, pattern, is, beautiful., This, is, because, the, beauty, depends, on, or, is, determined, by, that, specific, pattern., But, it, is, not, part, of, what, it, is, to, be, that, pattern, that, it, is, beautiful., That, is,, the, pattern, is, necessarily, beautiful, but, it, is, not, essentially, beautiful., (On, the, general, distinction, between, necessity, and, essence,, see, Fine, 1994.), Furthermore,, we, can, think, of, that, pattern, without, thinking, of, it, as, beautiful., By, contrast,, it, is, both, necessary, and, essential, that, something, that, is, elegant, is, beautiful., And, this, is, reflected, in, our, concepts, and, judgments., We, can, think, of, the, pattern, without, thereby, thinking, of, it, as, beautiful,, but, to, think, of, the, pattern, as, elegant, is, to, think, of, it, as, beautiful,, at, least, in, certain, respects., Hence, elegance, is, an, aesthetic, concept., The, hierarchical, proposal, thus, seems, to, characterize, a, non-arbitrary, and, useful, notion, of, the, aesthetic., If, so,, the, contemporary, broad, notion, of, the, aesthetic, can, be, vindicated., Jerrold, Levinson, has, argued, that, not, all, substantive, properties, have, evaluative, valence, (Levinson, 2001)., One, of, his, examples, is, of, 'starkly, grim'., If, so, being, starkly, grim, cannot, be, a, way, of, being, beautiful, of, ugly., However,, the, defender, of, hierarchy, could, reply, that, it, is, specific, uses, of, these, words,, in, context,, that, pick, out, features, that, have, evaluative, valence., The, particular, instance, of, stark, grimness, is, a, valueble, aspect, of, a, thing., Are, representational, properties, aesthetic, properties?, Suppose, that, a, painting, represents, a, tree, and, is, a, beautiful, representation, of, a, tree., It, is, not, merely, beautiful, and, a, tree, representation, but, beautiful, as, a, tree, representation, (Zangwill, 1999)., Of, course,, that, the, painting, represents, a, tree, is, “relevant”, to, whether, it, is, beautiful, because, it, is, part, of, what, its, beauty, depends, on., But, being, beautiful, is, not, part, of, what, it, is, to, be, a, representation, of, a, tree., Moreover,, to, think, that, the, painting, represents, a, tree, is, not, thereby, to, think, that, it, is, beautiful., Being, beautiful, is, not, an, essential, property, of, the, representation,, and, thinking, of, the, representation, does, not, mean, thinking, of, it, as, beautiful,, even, though, it, may, be, necessary, that, it, is, beautiful., Hence, representational, properties, are, not, aesthetic, properties., What, about, sublimity?, Why, prioritize, beauty, and, ugliness, among, aesthetic, concepts?, It, is, true, that, there, is, a, long, tradition, of, conceiving, of, sublimity, such, that, it, excludes, beauty, (Burke, 1998)., If, we, conceive, of, beauty, as, merely, an, elegant, and, pretty, value, property,, then, that, would, be, a, narrow, concept, of, beauty,, which, would, be, a, substantive, aesthetic, property., (See, Levinson, 2012.), However,, it, is, not, clear, that, there, is, much, reason, to, restrict, beauty, and, ugliness, in, this, way., If, beauty, is, a, generic, aesthetic, value,, then, sublimity, can, be, understood, as, a, kind, of, beauty., In, that, case,, it, turns, out, that, it, is, sublimity, that, is, a, substantive, aesthetic, concept,, not, beauty., On, this, view,, beauty, and, sublimity, are, not, opposed., Instead, sublimity, is, a, kind, of, beauty., 3.3, Aesthetic, Morals, Substantive, aesthetic, judgments, attracted, much, attention, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century., But, to, some, extent, this, may, have, been, a, mistake,, since, it, seems, that, the, role, of, such, judgments, is, to, serve, verdictive, aesthetic, judgments, of, beauty, and, ugliness., Beauty, and, ugliness, are, the, primary, aesthetic, notions,, which, give, sense, to, the, wider, class, that, contemporary, aestheticians, include, as, “aesthetic”., We, need, a, hierarchical, rather, than, an, egalitarian, conception, of, aesthetic, notions., The, broad, notion, of, the, aesthetic, can, be, fixed, by, what, it, is, to, judge, that, something, is, beautiful, or, ugly,, or, that, it, has, aesthetic, merit, or, demerit., Only, by, seeing, beauty, and, ugliness, as, the, preeminent, aesthetic, notions, can, we, make, sense, of, a, unitary, category, of, the, aesthetic,, which, includes, the, dainty, and, the, dumpy,, and, which, excludes, physical,, sensory, and, representational, properties, of, things,, as, well, as, their, agreeableness., The, hierarchical, proposal, allows, us, to, make, the, aesthetic/nonaesthetic, distinction, in, a, useful, way, and, answer, Beardsley, and, Sibley's, critics., Thus, the, notion, of, the, aesthetic, can, be, defended., That, leaves, open, the, deep, question, of, how, aesthetic, judgments, are, possible, —, a, matter, not, addressed, here., Bibliography, References, Beardsley,, Monroe,, 1958., Aesthetics,, Indianapolis:, Hackett., An,
