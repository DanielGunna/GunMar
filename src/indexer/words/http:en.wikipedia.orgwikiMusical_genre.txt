message), A, music, genre, is, a, conventional, category, that, identifies, some, pieces, of, music, as, belonging, to, a, shared, tradition, or, set, of, conventions.[1], It, is, to, be, distinguished, from, musical, form, and, musical, style,, although, in, practice, these, terms, are, sometimes, used, interchangeably.[2][not, in, citation, given], Recently,, academics, have, argued, that, categorizing, music, by, genre, is, inaccurate, and, outdated.[3], Music, can, be, divided, into, different, genres, in, many, different, ways., The, artistic, nature, of, music, means, that, these, classifications, are, often, subjective, and, controversial,, and, some, genres, may, overlap., There, are, even, varying, academic, definitions, of, the, term, genre, itself., In, his, book, Form, in, Tonal, Music,, Douglass, M., Green, distinguishes, between, genre, and, form., He, lists, madrigal,, motet,, canzona,, ricercar,, and, dance, as, examples, of, genres, from, the, Renaissance, period., To, further, clarify, the, meaning, of, genre,, Green, writes,, "Beethoven's, Op., 61, and, Mendelssohn's, Op., 64, are, identical, in, genre, –, both, are, violin, concertos, –, but, different, in, form., However,, Mozart's, Rondo, for, Piano,, K., 511,, and, the, Agnus, Dei, from, his, Mass,, K., 317, are, quite, different, in, genre, but, happen, to, be, similar, in, form."[4], Some,, like, Peter, van, der, Merwe,, treat, the, terms, genre, and, style, as, the, same,, saying, that, genre, should, be, defined, as, pieces, of, music, that, share, a, certain, style, or, "basic, musical, language."[5], Others,, such, as, Allan, F., Moore,, state, that, genre, and, style, are, two, separate, terms,, and, that, secondary, characteristics, such, as, subject, matter, can, also, differentiate, between, genres.[6], A, music, genre, or, subgenre, may, also, be, defined, by, the, musical, techniques,, the, style,, the, cultural, context,, and, the, content, and, spirit, of, the, themes., Geographical, origin, is, sometimes, used, to, identify, a, music, genre,, though, a, single, geographical, category, will, often, include, a, wide, variety, of, subgenres., Timothy, Laurie, argues, that, since, the, early, 1980s,, "genre, has, graduated, from, being, a, subset, of, popular, music, studies, to, being, an, almost, ubiquitous, framework, for, constituting, and, evaluating, musical, research, objects".[7], Among, the, criteria, often, used, to, classify, musical, genres, are, the, trichotomy, of, art,, popular,, and, traditional, musics., Alternatively,, music, can, be, divided, on, three, variables:, arousal,, valence,, and, depth.[3], Arousal, reflects, the, energy, level, of, the, music;, valence, reflects, the, scale, from, sad, to, happy, emotions,, and, depth, reflects, the, level, of, emotional, depth, in, the, music.[3], These, three, variables, help, explain, why, many, people, who, like, similar, songs, from, different, traditionally, segregated, genres.[3], Contents, 1, The, art/popular/traditional, distinction, 1.1, Art, music, 1.2, Popular, music, 1.3, Traditional, music, 1.4, Critics, of, the, axiomatic, triangle, 1.5, Automatic, categorization, 2, Emergence, of, new, genres, and, subgenres, 3, See, also, 4, References, 5, Further, reading, The, art/popular/traditional, distinction[edit], Musicologists, have, sometimes, classified, music, according, to, a, trichotomic, distinction, such, as, Philip, Tagg's, "axiomatic, triangle, consisting, of, 'folk',, 'art', and, 'popular', musics".[8], He, explains, that, each, of, these, three, is, distinguishable, from, the, others, according, to, certain, criteria.[8], Art, music[edit], Main, article:, Art, music, See, also:, List, of, art, music, traditions, The, term, art, music, refers, primarily, to, classical, traditions,, including, both, contemporary, and, historical, classical, music, forms., Art, music, exists, in, many, parts, of, the, world., It, emphasizes, formal, styles, that, invite, technical, and, detailed, deconstruction[9], and, criticism,, and, demand, focused, attention, from, the, listener., In, Western, practice,, art, music, is, considered, primarily, a, written, musical, tradition,[10], preserved, in, some, form, of, music, notation, rather, than, being, transmitted, orally,, by, rote,, or, in, recordings,, as, popular, and, traditional, music, usually, are.[10][11], Historically,, most, western, art, music, has, been, written, down, using, the, standard, forms, of, music, notation, that, evolved, in, Europe,, beginning, well, before, the, Renaissance, and, reaching, its, maturity, in, the, Romantic, period., The, identity, of, a, "work", or, "piece", of, art, music, is, usually, defined, by, the, notated, version, rather, than, by, a, particular, performance,, and, is, primarily, associated, with, the, composer, rather, than, the, performer, (though, composers, may, leave, performers, with, some, opportunity, for, interpretation, or, improvisation)., This, is, so, particularly, in, the, case, of, western, classical, music., Art, music, may, include, certain, forms, of, jazz,, though, some, feel, that, jazz, is, primarily, a, form, of, popular, music., Sacred, Christian, music, forms, an, important, part, of, the, classical, music, tradition, and, repertoire,, but, can, also, be, considered, to, have, an, identity, of, its, own.[citation, needed], Popular, music[edit], Main, article:, Popular, music, The, term, popular, music, refers, to, any, musical, style, accessible, to, the, general, public, and, disseminated, by, the, mass, media., Musicologist, and, popular, music, specialist, Philip, Tagg, defined, the, notion, in, the, light, of, sociocultural, and, economical, aspects:, Popular, music,, unlike, art, music,, is, (1), conceived, for, mass, distribution, to, large, and, often, socioculturally, heterogeneous, groups, of, listeners,, (2), stored, and, distributed, in, non-written, form,, (3), only, possible, in, an, industrial, monetary, economy, where, it, becomes, a, commodity, and, (4), in, capitalist, societies,, subject, to, the, laws, of, 'free', enterprise ..., it, should, ideally, sell, as, much, as, possible.[8], Popular, music, is, found, on, most, commercial, radio, stations,, in, most, commercial, music, retailers, and, department, stores,, and, in, movie, and, television, soundtracks., It, is, noted, on, the, Billboard, charts, and,, in, addition, to, singer-songwriters, and, composers,, it, involves, music, producers, more, than, other, genres, do., The, distinction, between, classical, and, popular, music, has, sometimes, been, blurred, in, marginal, areas[12], such, as, minimalist, music, and, light, classics., Background, music, for, films/movies, often, draws, on, both, traditions., In, this, respect,, music, is, like, fiction,, which, likewise, draws, a, distinction, between, literary, fiction, and, popular, fiction, that, is, not, always, precise., Traditional, music[edit], Main, article:, Traditional, music, Traditional, music, is, a, modern, name, for, what, has, been, called, "folk, music",, excluding, the, expansion, of, the, term, folk, music, to, include, much, non-traditional, material., Sometimes, "folk", is, designated, for, Western, music, and, non-Western, music, is, considered, "world, music"., The, two, are, both, unified, as, traditional, music, due, to:, Oral, transmission:, The, music, is, handed, down, and, learned, through, singing,, listening,, and, sometimes, dancing;, Cultural, basis:, The, music, derives, from, and, is, part, of, the, traditions, of, a, particular, region, or, culture., Critics, of, the, axiomatic, triangle[edit], Musicologist, and, popular, music, specialist, Richard, Middleton, has, discussed, the, blurred, nature, of, these, distinctions:, Neat, divisions, between, 'folk', and, 'popular',, and, 'popular', and, 'art',, are, impossible, to, find, ..., arbitrary, criteria, [are, used], to, define, the, complement, of, 'popular'., 'Art', music,, for, example,, is, generally, regarded, as, by, nature, complex,, difficult,, demanding;, 'popular', music, then, has, to, be, defined, as, 'simple',, 'accessible',, 'facile'., But, many, pieces, commonly, thought, of, as, 'art', (Handel's, 'Hallelujah, Chorus',, many, Schubert, songs,, many, Verdi, arias), have, qualities, of, simplicity;, conversely,, it, is, by, no, means, obvious, that, the, Sex, Pistols', records, were, 'accessible',, Frank, Zappa's, work, 'simple',, or, Billie, Holiday's, 'facile'.[13], Automatic, categorization[edit], This, section, needs, expansion., You, can, help, by, adding, to, it., (February, 2014), Automatic, methods, of, musical, similarity, detection,, based, on, data, mining, and, co-occurrence, analysis,, have, been, developed, in, order, to, classify, music, titles, for, electronic, music, distribution.[14], Emergence, of, new, genres, and, subgenres[edit], New, genres, can, arise, by, the, development, of, new, forms, and, styles, of, music, and, also, simply, by, creating, a, new, categorization., Although, it, is, conceivable, to, create, a, musical, style, with, no, relation, to, existing, genres,, new, styles, usually, appear, under, the, influence, of, preexisting, genres., The, genealogy, of, musical, genres, expresses,, often, in, the, form, of, a, written, chart,, the, way, in, which, new, genres, have, developed, under, the, influence, of, older, ones., If, two, or, more, existing, genres, influence, the, emergence, of, a, new, one,, a, fusion, between, them, can, be, said, to, have, taken, place., The, proliferation, of, popular, music, in, the, 20th, century, has, led, to, over, 1,200, definable, subgenres, of, music.[15], See, also[edit], Composition, school, Genealogy, of, musical, genres, List, of, music, styles, List, of, popular, music, genres, List,
