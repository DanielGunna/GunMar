[RDF, From, Semantic, Web, Standards, Jump, to:, navigation,, search, Publication, date:, 2014-02-25, (with, a, previous, version, published, at:, 2004-02-10), Created, by:, RDF, Working, Group, List, of, documents, at:, http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/rdf, Resource, Description, Framework, (RDF), Overview, RDF, is, a, standard, model, for, data, interchange, on, the, Web., RDF, has, features, that, facilitate, data, merging, even, if, the, underlying, schemas, differ,, and, it, specifically, supports, the, evolution, of, schemas, over, time, without, requiring, all, the, data, consumers, to, be, changed., RDF, extends, the, linking, structure, of, the, Web, to, use, URIs, to, name, the, relationship, between, things, as, well, as, the, two, ends, of, the, link, (this, is, usually, referred, to, as, a, “triple”)., Using, this, simple, model,, it, allows, structured, and, semi-structured, data, to, be, mixed,, exposed,, and, shared, across, different, applications., This, linking, structure, forms, a, directed,, labeled, graph,, where, the, edges, represent, the, named, link, between, two, resources,, represented, by, the, graph, nodes., This, graph, view, is, the, easiest, possible, mental, model, for, RDF, and, is, often, used, in, easy-to-understand, visual, explanations., Recommended, Reading, The, RDF, 1.1, specification, consists, of, a, suite, of, W3C, Recommendations, and, Working, Group, Notes,, published, in, 2014., This, suite, also, includes, an, RDF, Primer., See, also, Tim, Berners-Lee’s, writings, on, Web, Design, Issues,, including, Metadata, Architecture., Other, technologies,, like, OWL, or, SKOS,, build, on, RDF, and, provide, language, for, defining, structured,, Web-based, ontologies, which, enable, richer, integration, and, interoperability, of, data, among, descriptive, communities., A, number, of, textbooks, have, been, published, on, RDF, and, on, Semantic, Web, in, general., Please,, refer, to, a, separate, page, listing, some, of, those,, as, maintained, by, the, community., That, list, also, includes, references, to, conference, proceedings, and, article, collections, that, might, be, of, general, interest., Discussions, on, a, possible, next, version, of, RDF, W3C, has, recently, set, up, a, new, RDF, Working, Group,, whose, charter, is, to, make, a, minor, revision, of, RDF., Tools, that, are, listed, as, relevant, to, RDF, (Note, that, you, can, browse, tools, per, tool, categories, or, programming, languages,, too.), Last, modified, and/or, added, The, description, of, the, following, tools,
