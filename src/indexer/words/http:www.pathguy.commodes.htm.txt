[The, Ancient, Musical, Modes:, What, Were, They?, Ed, Friedlander, MD, scalpel_blade@yahoo.com, No, texting, or, chat, messages,, please., Ordinary, e-mails, are, welcome., I, play, keyboard, and, tend, to, notice, scales, when, I, hear, music., I, have, an, idea, about, the, original, Greek, Modes., I, think, that, when, Plato, and, Aristotle, refer, to, the, various, modes,, they, are, referring, to, various, possible, ways, of, tuning, a, seven-stringed, lyre., The, names, for, different, tunings, were, later, applied, to, the, various, musical, scales., Consider, the, distance, between, two, pitches,, one, with, twice, the, frequency, of, the, other., If, you, subdivide, this, into, twelve, equal, intervals,, you, get, the, equal-tempered, chromatic, scale., This, series, of, tones, includes, tones, that, almost, match, Pythagoras's, diatonic, scale, and, the, scales, used, in, most, folk, music, around, the, world., The, equal-tempering, allows, key, shifts., (Mathematics, is, amazing.), C, Scale, Frequency, Pythagorean,   ("Well, Tempered"),   ("Just, Intonation"), C, 1.0000, 1, C#, 1.0595, D, 1.1223, 1, 1/8, D#, 1.1892, E, 1.2599, 1, 1/4, F, 1.3348, 1, 1/3, F#, 1.4142, G, 1.4983, 1, 1/2, G#, 1.5874, A, 1.6818, 1, 2/3, A#, 1.7818, B, 1.8877, 1, 7/8, C, 2.0000, Perhaps, Pythagoras, would, have, placed, the, "blue, notes", at, 1 1/5,, 1 3/5,, and, 1 4/5., The, church, modes, of, medieval, and, early, modern, music, supposely, derive, from, modes, named, by, the, ancient, Greeks, and, described, by, their, writers., According, to, the, nomenclature, of, medieval, music, theorists,, who, were, dealing, largely, with, unchorded, plainsong,, our, natural, major, is, the, church, "Ionian, Mode", (C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C),, and, our, natural, minor, is, the, church, "Aeolian, mode", (C-D-Eb-F-G-Ab-Bb-C)., I, became, curious, about, modes, when, I, learned, that, "Wreck, of, the, Edmund, Fitzgerald", and, "Scarborough, Fair", use, the, old, balladic, scale, which, matches, the, church, "Dorian, Mode", (C-D-Eb-F-G-A-Bb-C);, I, think, "Age, of, Aquarius", does, the, same,, the, sea-song, "Whay,, Hay, and, Up, She, Rises",, and, "Dreadful, Wind, and, Rain", does, also., I, used, the, eerie, church, "Mixolydian, mode", (C-D-E-F-G-A-Bb-C), for, my, intranet, version, of, "The, Pathology, Blues",, on, our, quizbank., You, can, also, hear, the, church, "Mixolydian, mode", in, "The, Beat, Goes, On",, "Ritual, Fire, Dance",, "Luck, Be, a, Lady, Tonight",, the, "Star, Trek", theme,, "Norwegian, Wood",, "Day, Tripper",, "Sundown", (Gordon, Lightfoot),, "Cats, in, the, Cradle",, "City, of, New, Orleans", (verse, but, not, chorus),, and, the, theme, to, "Star, Wars"., Caedmon, recordings, used, it, for, the, tune, for, the, mystical, first, song, in, Yeats's, play, "The, Only, Jealousy, of, Emer"., The, other, church, modes, are, novelties, at, best., Some, of, the, old, Gregorian, chant, "Sing, my, tongue...", seems, to, be, Phrygian, mode., There, is, some, of, the, church, "Phrygian, mode", in, "Fiddler, on, the, Roof",, and, if, the, song, is, fully, transposed, into, the, church, Phygian, mode,, it, still, sounds, okay., My, own, attempt, to, write, a, song, using, the, church, Phrygian, mode, was, dismal., I, wrote, a, little, song, in, an, unabashed, church, "Lydian, mode"., The, mode, itself, suggested, the, subject., Unless, you, only, use, the, subdominant, as, a, leading, tone, for, the, dominant,, any, melody, you, write, in, this, "mode", will, be, unnerving, --, the, subdominant, is, equidistant, from, the, lower, and, upper, tonics., A, correspondent, pointed, out, that, the, "Lydian", mode, makes, up, some, of, the, "Jetsons", and, "Simpsons", theme., Bartok, wrote, a, short, piece, called, "Lydia", in, the, Lydian, mode, to, demonstrate., Click, here, for, a, here, to, hear, this., Another, correspondent, ("Piano, Pete", from, Glasgow,, Scotland), tells, me, that, the, song, Lydia, by, Faure, is, written, in, the, Lydian, mode;, "Hebe", is, Phrygian., Yet, another, of, my, cyberfriends, (Rasa,, of, Starseed, Music), is, a, musician, with, a, special, interest, in, the, emotive, power, of, the, modes, as, we, know, them, today., The, group's, performance, of, a, piece, in, the, Lydian, mode, is,, I, found, myself, agreeing,, "hauntingly, beautiful", rather, than, unnerving., In, the, Locrian, mode,, the, dead-center, position, of, the, dominant, makes, this, even, more, unmusical., A, music, professional, told, me, once, that, no, ethnomusicologist, has, ever, documented, a, folk, tune, in, what, medieval, theorists, called, the, "Locrian, mode"., I, browsed, a, little, in, Plato,, Aristotle,, pseudo-Plutarch's, "De, Musica",, and, of, course, the, Oxford, History, of, Music,, and, came, away, wondering, if, the, medieval, music, theorists, (Boethius,, Gregory, the, Great,, their, successors), really, meant, the, same, thing, as, did, the, Greeks, who, named, the, modes., Today, most, people, (following, a, scholar, named, Westphal), tell, us, that, the, Greek, modes, were, indeed, used, as, "scales", with, the, tonic, notes, being, the, low-pitched, one,, just, as, the, church, mode, theorists, say., This, seems, to, be, based, on, statements, in, Plato, and, Aristotle, that, the, modes, had, distinct, emotive, qualities,, as, our, major, and, minor, scales, do., Another, school, of, thought, (that, of, Munro), claims, that, for, the, ancients,, the, modes, were, actually, keys,, i.e.,, you, could, play, any, melody, in, any, mode., If, this, is, true,, then, the, ancient, Greeks, had, either, perfect, pitch, or, a, standard, pitchpipe., I, think, people, have, probably, liked, similar, tunes, in, different, eras., I, tried, to, figure, out, how, the, ancient, Greeks, would, have, played, some, of, our, favorites., Ancient, Greek, lyres, typically, had, seven, strings., (Some, Hebrew, lyres, must, have, had, ten, strings, --, see, Psalm, 33.), The, system, of, modes, is, also, called, "harmoniae",, which, meant, "fitting", or, "tuning"., Greek, writers, on, music, talk, about, the, normal, tuning, comprising, two, tetrachords,, i.e.,, a, series, of, four, notes, with, the, lowest, and, highest, separated, by, a, major, fourth, and, sharing, the, center, string., Pythagoras, and, Terpander, are, both, credited, with, the, idea, of, having, the, highest, string, be, an, octave, of, the, lowest, string., Here, are, examples, of, how, to, tune, a, seven-string, lyre, to, play, some, popular, melodies,, with, the, lowest, string, arbitrarily, set, a, "C", with, the, tonic, underlined., Yankee, Doodle, (verse):, C-D-E-F-G-A-Bb, (original, Dorian, mode?), Man, on, the, Flying, Trapeze:, C-D-E-F-G-A-A#, (original, Dorian, mode?),

theme:, C-Db-F-G-G#-A-Bb, These, are, my, best, guesses, about, which, was, which,, based, on, this, information:, The, Greek, musical, system, supposedly, began, with, a, four-stringed, lyre, playing, a, tetrachord, C-D-E-F., When, three, more, strings, were, added,, they, supposedly, made, a, second, tetrachord, along, with, the, fourth, string., This, is, the, "Yankee, Doodle", tuning., Terpander, is, sometimes, credited, with, inventing, the, "Yankee, Doodle", tuning,, and/or, with, the, modification, which, places, the, seventh, string, as, an, octave, of, the, first, (i.e.,, the, "Ten, Little, Indians", tuning.), Terpander, was, supposedly, the, founder, of, the, Dorian, system, of, music., So, either, the, "Yankee, Doodle", tuning, or, the, "Ten, Little, Indians", tuning, must, have, been, the, original, Dorian, mode., I, think, the, "Yankee, Doodle", and, "Ten, Little, Indians", tunings, are, the, two, easiest, ones, for, composers., So, the, one, which, wasn't, the, Dorian, mode, must, have, been, the, Phrygian, mode,, since, these, seem, to, have, been, the, ancient, world's, two, favorites., The, "Ten, Little, Indians", tuning, allows, you, to, end, your, song, with, a, four-note, major, chord, with, the, tonic, ending, the, melody., This, must, have, been, popular., Plato, preferred, the, Phrygian, mode, for, peacetime, liturgy, while, Aristotle, preferred, it, for, rowdy, drinking, songs., Generally,, melodies, on, the, "Ten, Little, Indians", tuning, are, happy., "The, Bear, Went, Over, the, Mountain",, which, might, be, the, oldest, secular, song, we, know, (it, was, a, crusader, hymn),, can, be, played, on, either, tuning,, but, you, can, end, it, with, a, four-note, major, chord, if, you, use, the, "Ten, Little, Indians", tuning., The, same, is, true, of, "Oh!, Susannah"., So, this, is, why, I, chose, as, I, did, for, these, songs., You, can, write, both, marching, songs, and, songs, of, grave, emotion, using, the, "Yankee, Doodle", tuning,, and, Plato, points, out, that, the, Dorian, mode, is, flexable., When, Plato, said, the, Dorian, mode, sounds, sincere,, and, Aristotle, said, that, it, avoids, extremes,, they, perhaps, meant, that, there, are, no, 1, 1/2-step, intervals,, and/or, that, the, upper, tetrachord, matches, the, lower, tetrachord, and/or, that, the, tonic, would, usually, fall, on, one, of, the, middle, strings., So, I, believe, that, the, "Ten, Little, Indians", tuning, was, the, original, Phrygian, mode,, and, that, the, "Yankee, Doodle", tuning, was, the, original, Dorian, mode., Plato, identified, the, Lydian, and, Mixolydian, as, being, for, maudlin, drinking, songs., The, "Danny, Boy", tuning, and, the, "Johnny, comes, Marching, Home"/"Rock, of, Ages", tuning, both, allow, a, song, to, end, with, a, four-note, minor, chord, with, the, tonic, in, the, melody., The, "Johnny, Comes, Marching, Home", tuning, will, often, have, the, tonic, on, the, first, or, third, strings,, generating, a, minor, scale, in, either, case., The, "Danny, Boy", tuning, give, a, minor, scale, when, the, tonic, is, on, the, first, string., If, the, tonic, is, on, the, third, string,, it, gives, a, major, scale, with, the, low, and, high, strings, respectively, providing, the, plaintive, minor, third, and, major, sixth., All, this, is, perfect, for, tears-in-beers, music., So, "Danny, Boy", and, "Johnny, Comes, Marching, Home", are, my, choices, respectively, for, Lydian, and, Mixolydian., ("Danny, Boy", has, a, minor, tetrachord, at, the, bottom, so, I'll, suppose, it, is, the, more, primitive.), The, other, really, obvious, thing, to, do, with, the, seven-string, lyre, is, tune, it, to, play, "My, Darling, Clementine"., This, is, my, choice, for, the, last, mode, mentioned, by, the, two, great, philosophers--the, Ionian., Plato, calls, the, Ionian, mode, relaxing,, and, Aristotle, claimed, it, made, people, stupid., Maybe, not, "stupid"..., but, I'd, agree, that, it's, easy, to, write, gentle, mellow, songs, using, the, "My, Darling, Clementine", tuning., I, matched, the, original, Locrian, Mode, and, the, "My, Country, 'Tis, of, Thee", scale,, because, both, have, the, lowest, note, a, half-step, below, the, likely, tonic, on, the, second, string., The, original, Aeolian, mode, is, unassigned,, and, I, suspect, it, was, either, the, "Take, My, Breath, Away", tuning, or, the, "Popeye, the, Sailor, Man", tuning., The, former, is, haunting;, the, latter, is, simple, and, is, another, tuning, that, invites, a, four-note, major, chord, at, the, end, of, the, major-tune, melody., Obviously, I'm, speculating, about, what, Plato, and, Aristotle, were, actually, talking, about., But, I, think, (until, somebody, shows, me, I'm, wrong), that, the, "modes", were, originally, neither, keys, nor, scales., They, were, originally, just, different, ways, of, tuning, a, lyre, to, play, different, melodies., Can, any, real, musicologist, help, me?, Links, to, ancient, writers:, In, Laches,, Plato, calls, the, Dorian, the, real, Greek, mode,, and, says, that, it, creates, a, feeling, of, sincerity., He, contrasts, it, with, the, Ionian,, Phrygian,, and, Lydian., In, The, Republic,, Plato, claimed, that, the, Ionian, and, Lydian, are, "relaxed, /, soft, /, drinking", systems,, without, military, use,, and, should, be, banned., (It, is, hard, to, believe, commentators, who, say, that, "relaxed", just, means, the, strings, are, less, taut, and, thus, lower-pitched.), Plato, also, described, the, two, Lydian, systems,, as, expressing, sorrow., The, Dorian, would, remain, legal, for, use, in, war, and, crisis,, and, the, Phrygian, for, peace,, dignity,, temperance,, and, worship., The, discussion, indicates, that, lyres, were, manufactured, in, various, modes., Plato, wanted, the, government, to, control, popular, music, by, allowing, only, the, manufacture, of, lyres, built, for, the, approved, modes., In, particular,, Plato, wanted, to, ban, lyres, with, lots, of, strings, ("a, multiplicity, of, notes"), able, to, play, several, different, modes., Aristotle, in, the, "Politics", said, that, the, Mixolydian, mode, can, make, you, sad, and, grave., The, Dorian, mode, settles, the, mind, and, is, gravest, and, manliest, and, "avoids, extremes"., The, Phrygian, mode, inspires, enthusiasm, and, is, exciting, and, emotional, and, the, best, for, expressing, "Bacchic, fury"., The, "relaxed, modes",, i.e.,, Lydian, and, Ionian, make, people, stupid., Complaints, about, styles, of, music, corrupting, young, people, aren't, new., If, we, are, to, take, this, as, evidence, that, the, modes, were, scales, with, the, tonic, note, fixed, on, the, lowest, pitch,, we, must, explain, a, few, things., Scales, between, set, tonics, do, have, emotive, qualities., Even, children, in, early, grade, school, with, me, agreed, that, the, natural, major, scale, is, "happy", and, the, minor, scales, are, "sad"., Yet, Plato, and, Aristotle, cannot, agree, about, what, kind, of, music, is, typical, of, the, Phrygian, mode., This, says, to, me,, loud, and, clear,, that, whatever, the, Phrygian, mode, really, was,, it, did, not, actually, have, any, single, distinctive, emotive, quality., Instead,, Plato, and, Aristotle, were, recording, their, responses, to, musicians, (or, styles, of, music), who, happened, to, prefer, particular, tunings., Although, the, church, "Aeolian, mode", sounds, sad,, the, church, "Mixolydian, mode", doesn't., It's, a, little, different,, bouncy,, and, fun., And, the, church, "Phrygian, mode", is, very, hard, to, use, for, composing, music, that, people, will, actually, like., This, tells, me, that, even, if, the, "modes", of, Plato, and, Aristotle, were, scales,, they, don't, match, the, church, modes, named, from, them., Anyway,, in, "The, Republic",, Plato, talks, about, restricting, the, numbers, of, strings, on, lyres, so, they, could, only, play, a, government-approved, mode., I, find, no, evidence, that, the, low-pitched, note, had, to, be, the, tonic., I'm, satisfied., Clement, of, Alexandria, knew, the, Dorian, and, Phrygian, "harmonies", (tunings), and, thought, David, probably, tuned, Phrygian-style., Link, is, now, down:, Larry, Mysz, on, the, origins., He, also, doubts, that, Gregory's, "modes", had, much, to, do, with, those, of, Aristotle's, time., Some, conventional, lessions, about, modes:, Musical, EdVentures--music, theory, Greg, Lindahl, Ancient, Greek, Music, "History, of, Tuning", [link, is, now, down], gives, an, alternate, system, for, the, original, Greek, modes., Dorian, is, E, to, E, on, the, white, keys,, Phrygian, is, D, to, D, on, the, white, keys,, Lydian, is, the, major,, Aeolian, is, still, the, natural, minor,, Mixolydian, is, B, to, B,, etc., Credits, Pythagoras, with, introducing, the, octave, as, two, tetrachords, a, fifth, apart., Encyclopedia, of, tuning, Bill, Hammel--"We, are, not, quite, sure, what, a, Greek, mode, really, was.", Lucy, Tuning, Lucy's, scales,, at, U., of, Hawaii,, cited, sixty, named, scales, from, around, the, world., The, link, is, now, down., Erik, van, der, Meut, has, a, program, that,

about, my, idea, on, the, modes..., If, you, like, scales,, I, would, enjoy, hearing, from, you., The, standard, bugle, calls, are, tritonic, (C-E-G-C),, since, this, scale, plays, easily, and, naturally, on, a, bugle, and, these, simple, sequences, are, easy, to, distinguish., The, familiar, boot, camp, cadences, are, major, pentatonic, (C-D-E-G-A-C), or, minor, pentatonic, (C-D#-F-G-A#-C),, as, are, some, intended-to-be-simple, tunes, like, "Old, McDonald, had, a, Farm",, "Amazing, Grace",, "Jesus, Loves, me",, "There's, a, Hole, in, the, Bucket",, "The, Camptown, Races",, "Jesus, Walked, This, Lonesome, Valley",, "Best, Day, of, My, Life",, and, most, rock, licks, and, riffs., Some, very, old, songs, ("Pat-A-Pan",, "God, Rest, Ye, Merry"),, and, occasional, new, ones, written, to, sound, elemental, ("Neutron, Dance", from, "Beverly, Hills, Cop";, "Popcorn";, "Washington, Square",, "The, Good,, The, Bad,, and, the, Ugly", theme), or, simple, ("Gilligan's, Island", theme), are, in, the, church, "Aeolian", natural, minor., Here, are, some, other, unconventional, octave, scales, I, have, noticed,, with, the, tonic, at, "C":, Hungarian, Rhapsody, 3:,

together, in, high, school., Follow-Up:, April, 2005., I, had, no, idea, people, felt, this, strongly,, or, could, get, so, ugly,, about, the, subject, of, what, exactly, Plato, and, Aristotle, were, thinking, about, when, they, described, "the, modes.", Several, conservatory, types, have, written,, accusing, me, of, the, basest, stupidity, and, ignorance., However,, none, of, my, detractors, has, explained, to, me, why, I'm, wrong,, or, had, disagreed, with, my, little, study, of, what, popular, tunes, go, with, what, tunings., Combined, with, the, level, of, anger, directed, against, me,, this, makes, me, think, I'm, probably, right., After, all,, if, you, only, have, seven, notes, on, your, instrument,, what, reason, do, you, have, to, talk, about, scales?, My, cyberfriend, Walt, Lysack, writes, from, Manitoba:, If, you, have, not, yet, explored, "old, timey", music, from, the, Appalachians,, you, should, listen, to, Jean, Ritchie, play, the, Appalachian, dulcimer, tuned, to, each, of, the, 7, modes., The, interesting, thing, is, that, chords, can, be, created, only, with, a, couple, of, the, modal, tunings, on, the, dulcimer., The, dulcimer, fingerb, oard, is, like, a, guitar, fingerboard, with, somemissing, frets., The, other, modes, were, not, novelties, in, Appalachian, tunes., I, have, stuck, to, the, "autral", traditional, since, 1974., Everything, I, play, is, "by, ear", and, requires, "memorizing", 100s, of, tunes...., I, like, your, explanation, of, modes, the, best, of, all, I, have, read., The, "lyre, tunings", idea, is, reinforced, by, dulcimer, tunings., My, cyberfriend, Rom, Harre, (Distinguished, Research, Professor,, sychology, Department,, Georgetown, University), write:, I, am, writing, a, textbook, for, introductory, psychology, of, music..., Of, course, you, are, quite, right, that, the, modes, must, have, ben, tunings...., I, would, like, to, use, your, choice, of, illustrative, tunes, for, the, chapter, on, Greek, and, Medieval, music...., The, sound, tracks, you, added, are, charming, and, may, sound, like, the, lyre,, except, for, harmonies!!, No, Greek., Appreciated., Thanks., My, cyberfriend, Merrill, Humberg, explained, the, difference, between, equal, tempering, and, well-tempering, in, January, 2006., (I'd, always, believed, they, were, the, same.), Scott, Crothers, reminded, me, in, July, 2008, that, "all, the, notes, in, [a], Mode, need, to, be, represented, by, a, letter, name, only, once, in, order.", "Well-temperament", is, a, mode, that, was, used, before, "equal, temperament", took, hold, in, the, last, century., Well, temperament, was, a, few, different, compromise, tunings, (between, meantone, and, equal, temperaments), that, allowed, free, modulation, throughout, all, of, the, keys, but, still, attempted, to, keep, the, "character", of, the, keys, which, is, completely, lost, with, equal, temperament., Key, character, used, to, be, a, tool, that, composers, used, in, varying, "well-tempered", tunings, to, create, different, moods, by, writing, in, "uncommon", (usually, unusuable, due, to, the, meantone, or, pythagorean, tunings, used, in, the, past), keys, that, most, would, now, consider, as, "out, of, tune"., July, 2006:, An, internet, friend,, Andrew, Re,, who, clearly, has, a, good, ear,, wrote, me, to, say, that, Pink, Floyd's, "Set, the, controls, for, the,
