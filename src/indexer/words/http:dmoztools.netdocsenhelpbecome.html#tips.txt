corresponds, to, their, interests., Generally,, new, editors, apply, to, edit, in, small, categories, at, first,, and, then, apply, to, edit, additional, areas, after, they, have, accumulated, a, number, of, edits., Since, this, is, a, community, managed, project,, editors, often, do, a, lot, of, other, things, in, addition, to, listing, web, sites., Many, technologically, savvy, editors, help, to, build, editing, tools, and, features,, and, share, them, with, the, other, editors., Senior, editors, volunteer, to, mentor, junior, editors., Some, editors, initiate, editing, projects, to,

applications,, and, review, each, one, individually,, so, don't, worry, if, it, takes, several, days, until, you, get, a, response., Please, note, that, we, deny, applications, from, time, to, time,, and, no, application, is, guaranteed, acceptance., Are, there, requirements, for, being, an, editor?, Everyone, is, welcome, to, join, DMOZ., All, you, need, is, an, interest, or, passion, and, a,

of, fewer, than, 100, sites., Generally,, applicants, who, apply, for, too, broad, of, a, category, are, asked, to, narrow, their, focus,, and, apply, for, a, lower, level, category., We, view, the, application, as, an, indication, of, how, you, will, edit., A, thoughtful,, well-written, application, that, is, free, of, hype, has, a, far, greater, chance, of, getting, accepted, than, one, that, is, sloppy,, poorly-written,, and, full, of, promotional,, subjective, language., Finally,, be, truthful, about, your, affiliations, with, any, Web, sites., Webmasters,, site, owners,, and, friends,

directory, for, other, net-citizens, to, freely, share, and, distribute., Therefore,, editors, are, not, financially, compensated., One, of, the, unique, things, about, DMOZ, is, the, community, of, volunteers, who, altruistically, devote, their, time, and, subject, expertise, to, give, back, to, the, rest, of, the, Web, community., Editors, edit, for, the, love, and, fun, of, it, in, the, spirit, of, fostering, a, free, and, accessible, Web., Last, update:, Fri, Sep, 09, 15:19, EDT, 2016, Copyright, ©, 2016, AOL, Inc., (Terms, of, Use, -, License)]
