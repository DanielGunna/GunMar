Gary, Morris, November, 1,, 1999, Three, pioneering, American, neorealist, indies:, Little, Fugitive,, Weddings, and, Babies,, Lovers, and, Lollipops, “The, concept, of, making, the, film, almost, unnoticed, among, crowds, seemed, to, be, working.” –, Morris, Engel,, on, Little, Fugitive, In, the, early, days, of, cinema,, before, the, rise, of, the, Hollywood, studios, with, their, artificial,, controlled, environments, in, the, form, of, sets, and, sound, stages,, movies, took, advantage, of, real, locations, as, narrative, backdrops., These, could, be, cityscapes,, as, in, some, of, the, early, work, of, D., W., Griffith,, or, the, great, outdoors,, as, in, the, innumerable, westerns, that, were, a, staple, of, pre-modern, cinema., While, there, was, clearly, an, economic, motive, in, shooting, this, way,, there, was, also, a, sense, of, connecting, with, audiences, in, a, realistic, way, as, the, stories, they, saw, unfolded, in, recognizable, environments., In, spite, of, the, hypnotic, power, of, the, studio, “look,”, which, was, often, somehow, plush, even, in, gritty, genres, like, film, noir,, it, never, entirely, replaced, the, natural, setting., (Even, the, studios, continued, to, take, advantage, of, the, impact, of, some, locations,, for, example,, in, a, slum, street, in, a, Warner, Bros., pre-code, gangster, film.), Italian, neo-realism, was, one, of, several, filmic, styles, that, depended, on, reality, for, a, sense, of, immediacy, that, could, not, be, obtained, otherwise., In, the, late, 1950s,, the, nouvelle, vague, resurrected, this, approach, as, crucial, in, capturing, the, reality, of, people’s, lives., Between, neorealism, and, the, nouvelle, vague, stand, Morris, Engel, and, Ruth, Orkin,, whose, independent, feature, Little, Fugitive, (1953), has, been, credited, –, by, Francois, Truffaut,, who, ought, to, know, –, with, providing, both, spiritual, imprimatur, and, nuts-and-bolts, strategies, for, the, French, New, Wave., Engel, and, Orkin, were, both, still, photographers,, with, Engel, particularly, distinguished, as, a, colleague, of, Paul, Strand, and, a, pioneer, photojournalist, with, magazines, like, PM,, Fortune,, Collier’s., Orkin, also, had, ties, to, Hollywood, and, cinema, in, general, –, she, had, worked, for, MGM,, her, mother, was, a, silent, star,, and, she, had, edited, some, experimental, shorts,, an, experience, that, would, be, crucial, in, the, pair’s, future, collaborations., Engel, and, Orkin, provided, a, production, template, for, future, independent, filmmakers, by, doing, double, and, triple, duty, on, their, films., For, their, first, feature,, Engel,, Orkin,, and, Ray, Ashley, are, credited, with, direction,, Engel, and, Ashley, with, production,, Ashley, with, screenplay,, Orkin, and, Lester, Troob, with, editing,, and, Engel, with, photography., The, verite, photographic, style, can, be, attributed, to, an, unusual, camera, designed, by, Engel, and, produced, by, Charlie, Woodruff., This, camera, was, small, and, portable,, attached, by, a, single, strap, to, the, shoulder,, allowing, Engel, to, shoot, unnoticed, in, crowds,, from, inside, dicey, spaces, (like, a, baseball, batting, cage),, and, even, from, a, moving, amusement, park, ride, –, all, the, while, maintaining, a, steady, image, indistinguishable, from, the, professional, tripod-style, cameras., In, this, sense, the, device, could, be, seen, as, a, prototype, for, the, steadicam., It’s, not, hard, to, see, why, Little, Fugitive,, Engel, and, Orkin’s, most, famous, and, successful, film,, was, so, inspiring, not, only, to, the, French, but, also, to, American, auteurs, like, Cassavettes, (Shadows), and, Scorsese, (Who’s, That, Knocking, on, My, Door?)., Like, the, two, features, that, would, follow, it,, Little, Fugitive, is, a, paean, to, the, sights,, smells,, and, sounds, of, New, York,, from, the, cramped, but, somehow, comforting, streets, of, Brooklyn, to, the, dazzling, chaos, of, Coney, Island, as, seen, through, a, child’s, eyes., Engel, and, Orkin, extrapolate, the, universal, from, the, personal, in, this, Homeric, story, of, a, little, boy’s, heroic, trek, alone, through, the, vastness, of, an, urban, amusement, park., The, “fugitive”, of, the, title, is, Joey, Norton, (Richie, Andrusco),, a, 7-year-old, from, Brooklyn, who’s, left, in, the, care, of, his, 12-year-old, brother, Lennie, (Ricky, Brewster), when, their, mother, is, called, away, on, an, emergency., Lennie, and, his, friends, are, droll, pranksters,, and, they, pull, what, turns, out, to, be, a, potentially, deadly, joke, on, Joey:, they, let, him, shoot, a, real, gun, and, convince, him, that, he’s, killed, Lennie, and, that, they, cops, will, soon, be, after, him., Far, from, the, cliché, imagery, of, sweet,, obedient, 1950s, children,, these, kids, have, a, vicious, black-comic, edge:, “They’ll, sure, give, Joey, the, electric, chair, –, he’ll, fry!”, one, says., The, terrorized, boy, grabs, the, money, his, mother, left, for, him, and, Lennie,, and, runs, off, to, Coney, Island., When, Engel, interviewed, Richie, Andrusco, for, the, part, of, Joey,, he, noticed, what, he, called, an, “animal, strength”, that, made, him, right, for, the, part., This, quality, is, certainly, evident, as, Joey,, dwarfed, by, the, teeming, crowds,, whirling, neon,, and, boundless, expanse, of, sand,, moves, through, his, ordeal, with, what, can, only, be, called, aplomb., Not, that, there, are, overt, threats, –, the, crowds, are, mostly, indifferent, as, he, marches, along, collecting, bottles, to, redeem, for, pony, rides,, or, wriggles, into, a, group, of, adults, throwing, balls, at, milk, bottles,, demanding, his, chance, to, play., Witty, anecdotal, touches, abound., In, a, bathroom, reference, of, a, kind, that, was, de, rigueur, in, Italian, neorealism,, Joey, drinks, too, much, Pepsi, and, is, desperate, to, relieve, himself;, when, he, comes, upon, a, sign, that, says, MEN,, he, gratefully, traces, each, letter., The, film’s, sometimes, painterly, visuals, add, resonance, to, the, tiniest, details, –, two, toddlers, grappling, with, each, other, on, the, beach;, a, couple, making, out, on, a, blanket,, their, faces, unseen;, a, mother, spilling, her, baby’s, milk., These, shots, seem, at, once, casual,, real,, and, artful,, as, if, in, recording, the, simple, truth, of, an, event, the, filmmakers, have, stumbled, upon, art., There’s, a, stunning, sequence, of, a, sudden,, violent, storm, that, clears, the, beach,, and, the, filmmakers, take, great, delight, in, observing, the, chaos., Among, those, scrambling, toward, shelter, are, a, group, of, black, kids, delicately, stepping, through, the, huge, puddles, on, the, street, just, beyond, the, beach., In, a, lovely, wordless, passage,, Joey, wanders, across, the, beach, after, the, storm,, at, night,, dwarfed, by, the, enormity, of, the, world, around, him, and,, one, feels,, by, his, own, future., During, the, film’s, initial, release,, some, reviewers, compared, Richie, Andrusco, to, Jackie, Coogan,, another, way, of, reminding, us, that, Little, Fugitive, recalls, silent, film., His, wonderfully, affecting, performance,, surely, one, of, the, reasons, the, film, won, Venice’s, Silver, Lion, award, in, 1953,, showed, that, it, was, not, only, possible, but, desirable, for, filmmakers, to, seek, out, “amateur”, talent, without, the, tics, and, mannerisms, of, trained, actors., This, strategy, is, verified, in, the, freshness, of, the, other, performers,, particularly, Ricky, Brewster, as, Joey’s, initially, nasty, but, eventually, redeemed, brother,, Lennie., In, spite, of, the, commercial, and, critical, success, of, Little, Fugitive,, the, filmmakers, had, trouble, getting, financing, for, their, next, work, but, somehow, managed., Anyone, who, saw Little, Fugitive, would, recognize, Lovers, and, Lollipops, (1955), as, the, work, of, the, same, team,, even, without, the, credits., Again, we, see, the, milieu, of, New, York,, rendered, in, gorgeous, black-and-white, compositions,, and, again, there’s, a, child, at, the, center., This, time, it’s, a, girl,, Peggy, (Cathy, Dunn),, who, recalls, Joey, Norton, in, her, tenacity, and, willfulness., Both, are, imaginative, kids, with, an, active, inner, life, who, can, entertain, themselves, and, are, well-equipped, to, deal, with, any, adults, who, get, in, the, way, of, their, fun., Joey, had, no, visible, father,, only, brief,, shadowy, substitutes, like, the, pony-ride, man;, Peggy’s, father, is, dead,, and, she, feels, compelled, to, resist, her, mother, Ann’s, (Lori, March), threat, to, replace, him, with, a, new, one, in, the, form, of, Larry, (Gerald, O’Louglin),, an, old, friend, who’s, visiting., The, story, is, an, alternately, sweet, and, sad, triangle, –, Ann, and, Larry’s, precarious, relationship, and, Peggy’s, simultaneous, attempts, to, thwart, it, and, find, her, place, in, it., Morris, Engel, duing, the, shooting, of, Lovers, and, Lollipops, In, Little, Fugitive,, Joey’s, interactions, were, mostly, brief, encounters, with, strangers, on, the, beach., Lovers, and, Lollipops, focuses, closely, on, Peggy’s, relationships, with, the, adults, in, her, life, –, her, mother;, Larry,, a, sarcastic, babysitter;, and, a, photographer, who’s, taking, pictures, of, her, for, a, book., In, the, process, of, coming, to, grips, with, her, mother’s, romantic, life,, she, torments, the, indulgent, Larry, in, the, guise, of, spending, “quality, time”, with, him., During, a, scene, where, he, reads, to, her,, she, crawls, all, over, him,, mimics, and, laughs, at, him,, and, interrupts, him., This, is, a, rehearsal, for, other,, more, cutting, scenes, where, she, causes, endless, grief, by, hiding, from, him, in, a, parking, lot, (later, she, complains, to, her, mother,, “he, lost, me, too!”)., Any, attempt, at, romance, by, Ann, and, Larry, is, usually, met, with, force, by, Peggy,, who, eventually, offers, a, litany, of, Larry’s, “crimes”, in, the, martyred, mode, of, a, child:, “He, gave, me, a, rotten, sandwich, and, made, me, eat, all, of, it!”, Peggy’s, convention, busting, is, at, once, enchanting, and, nerve-wracking;, it, filigrees, the, film,, most, notably, in, a, scene, where, she, insists, on, carrying, her, toy, sailboat, into, a, museum, rather, than, checking, it., She, sneaks, it, in, and, sails, it, on, one, of, the, museum’s, small, pools,, creating, a, poignant, symbol, of, her, own, potential, drifting, away, from, her, mother., Naturalistic, performances, make, Lovers, and, Lollipops, as, vivid, and, fresh, today, as, when, it, was, released,, but, the, true, star, here,, more, even, than, in, Little, Fugitive,, is, the, city., Engel, and, Orkin’s, observations, are, again, both, casual, and, calculated,, the, camera, unobtrusively, recording, images, that, seem, unrelated, to, plot, but, hint, at, the, imaginative, life, behind, the, faces, and, streets, of, the, city., These, take, the, form, of, detailed, set-pieces,, as, in, a, long, sequence, on, the, Statue, of, Liberty;, and, of, throwaway, moments, like, the, scene, of, a, little, Chinese, boy, spanking, another, one, in, the, background., The, filmmakers, insist, on, the, validity, and, fascination, of, everyone’s, lives,, even, those, whose, details, we, never, see., Weddings, and, Babies, (1958), marked, the, end, of, a, cycle, –, the, third, in, what, could, loosely, be, called, the, filmmakers’, “New, York, Trilogy”, –, but, also, featured, a, second, technological, breakthrough, that, allowed, Engel, and, Orkin, to, create, a, movie, with, an, immediacy, rarely, seen, in, movies., In, a, September, 1958, Harper’s, article,, noted, documentarian, Richard, Leacock, described, it:, “Engel’s, earlier, films, had, been, dubbed, –, that, is,, they, had, used, a, system, perfected, by, the, postwar, Italian, film-makers, of, shooting, a, scene, with, a, silent, camera, and, then, fitting, dialogue, to, it, in, the, studio., This, made, it, possible, to, photograph, anywhere,, without, being, chained, to, the, big, clumsy, sound, cameras, or, upset, by, `extraneous, noise.’…, To, my, amazement,, Weddings, and, Babies, was, not, dubbed…, Here, was, a, feature, theatrical, film,, shot, on, regular, 35-mm, stock,, with, live, spontaneous, sound…., [it], is, the, first, theatrical, motion, picture, to, make, use, of, a, fully, mobile,, synchronous, sound-and-picture, system.”, Leacock, theorizes, that, what, spurred, this, invention, was, the, fact, that, the, filmmakers, were, used, to, taking, their, still, cameras, to, various, sites,, a, kind, of, mobility, impossible, with, traditional, equipment., They, wanted, to, replicate, this, ease, in, their, film,, and, the, result,, Weddings, and, Babies,, is, as, remarkable, as, their, earlier, efforts,, if, not, quite, on, par, with, Little, Fugitive., Part, of, its, freshness, today, is, because, of, the, “live, spontaneous, sound”, –, from, the, noises, of, a, street, fair, to, the, rising, voices, in, a, domestic, squabble., The, sometimes, clumsy, effect, of, post-dubbed, dialogue, in, the, earlier, films, is, absent, here., Weddings, and, Babies,, like, its, predecessors,, is, a, highly, personal, film,, a, kind, of, insider, view, of, working-class, life, that, resonates, with, the, filmmakers’, sweet, sensibility., Engel, seems, to, have, written, himself, discreetly, into, both, Little, Fugitive, and, Lovers, and, Lollipops, in, the, form, of, minor, characters, who, were, photographers., In, Weddings, and, Babies,, the, main, male, character, can, be, read, as, a, virtual, double., Al, (John, Mhyers),, like, Engel,, is, a, commercial, photographer, whose, hunger, to, “do, something, important”, is, frustrated, by, the, compromises, of, his, business,, which, only, survives, because, he’s, willing, to, spend, most, of, his, time, shooting, “weddings, and, babies.”, Al’s, girlfriend, Bea, (a, radiant, Viveca, Lindfors), wants, precisely, the, thing, that, he’s, come, to, hate:, a, wedding, and, babies., Added, to, the, mix, is, Al’s, aged, widowed, mother,, Mama, (Chiarina, Barile),, who, like, him, is, restless,, unsatisfied., Just, as, Al, roams, the, streets, with, his, camera,, trying, to, find, something, that, eludes, him, in, the, bustle, of, street, crowds, and, fairs,, his, mother, wanders, away, from, her, rest, home, and, eventually, disappears, at, a, key, moment, in, her, son’s, life, –, just, as, he’s, resigned, himself, to, marrying, Bea., Mama, embodies, the, film’s, theme, of, the, inability, of, people, to, communicate, in, the, most, literal, way, possible, –, she, speaks, not, English, but, Italian,, and, in, a, low, voice, that’s, barely, audible., In, all, these, films,, awesome, natural, forces, are, always, nearby,, waiting, to, remind, the, characters, that, there, are, larger, elements, of, life, that, must, be, respected., In, Little, Fugitive,, it’s, the, rainstorm, that, sends, the, beach, revelers, running,, bringing, a, sense, that, happiness, is, short-lived, and, therefore, precious., In, Weddings, and, Babies,, it’s, more, overt, in, an, extended, sequence, in, a, cemetery,, where, a, frantic, Al, finds, his, “lost”, mother, sitting, glumly, among, the, tombstones., These, scenes, assert, the, importance, of, noticing, the, pleasures, of, everyday, life,, of, living, in, the, moment., This, is, the, lesson, the, “fully, mobile,, synchronous, sound-and-picture, system,”, wedded, to, the, filmmakers’, gentle, sensibility,, brings, home., In, a, sense,, these, films, are, all, about, coming, to, grips, with, mortality, and, recognizing, how, important, other, people, are., It’s, only, after, a, serious, loss, is, threatened, –, the, disappearances, of, Joey,, Larry,, and, Bea, in,, respectively,, Little, Fugitive,, Lovers, and, Lollipops,, and, Weddings, and, Babies, –, that, the, value, of, the, individual, is, recognized, and, the, recovery, of, something, irreplaceable, occurs., This, is, what, Truffaut,, Cassavetes,, and, Scorsese, recognized,, and, what, makes, these, films, fresh,, timeless, works, of, art, today.,
