Technology, List, 7, Deadliest, Weapons, in, History, Say, “Group, of, Seven,”, and, most, folks, will, assume, you, are, referring, to, the, organization, of, the, world’s, leading, industrialized, countries,, whose, annual, summit, provides, the, mother, of, all, photo, opportunities, for, the, leaders, of, the, U.S.,, the, U.K.,, France,, Germany,, Italy,, Canada,, Japan,, and,, until, its, suspension, in, 2014,, Russia., As, it, happens,, the, leader, of, one, of, those, countries,, Canadian, Prime, Minister, Justin, Trudeau,, could, probably, tell, you, plenty, about, the, other, Group, of, Seven,, the, coterie, of, artists, who, created, the, national, style, of, expressionist, landscape, painting, in, the, 1910s, and, ’20s, that, injected, the, modern, into, Canadian, art, and, captured, the, spiritual, essence, of, the, Canadian, wilderness., Nearly, a, century, on,, the, Group, of, Seven, remains, a, touchstone, for, Canada’s, artistic, identity., Although, not, formally, constituted, until, 1920,, the, Group, of, Seven, sprung, from, relationships, that, began, developing, as, early, as, about, 1908, at, Grip, Ltd.,, a, commercial, design, firm, in, Toronto,, whose, senior, artist,, J.E.H., MacDonald,, encouraged, the, staff, to, hone, their, talents, with, plein-air, painting, in, their, spare, time., Like, much, of, the, staff,, MacDonald, had, received, extensive, formal, training, as, an, artist., The, other, Grip, employees, who, would, become, members, of, the, Group, of, Seven, were, Frank, H., (later, Franz), Johnston,, Franklin, Carmichael,, and, a, pair, of, English, immigrants,, Arthur, Lismer, and, F.H., Varley., The, diamond, in, the, rough, at, Grip, was, Tom, Thomson,, who, had, scant, formal, training, but, learned, from, his, coworkers, and, eventually, surpassed, them, all, in, his, mastery, of, technique, and, as, an, innovator., They, all, talked, art, at, the, Arts, and, Letters, Club, of, Toronto, with, another, pair, of, painters, who, completed, the, original, group:, A.Y., Jackson,, a, Montreal, native,, and, Lawren, Harris,, the, scion, of, the, Massey-Harris, farm, machinery, fortune, who, would, become, the, group’s, putative, leader., The, group’s, breakthrough, came, with, the, discovery, of, its, subject, matter,, the, shimmering, lakes, and, thick, boreal, forests, of, the, Canadian, Shield, in, Ontario,, a, landscape, that, the, art, establishment, had, deemed, too, wild, to, be, paintable, or, worthy, of, attention., Dazzled, by, an, exhibition, of, Scandinavian, landscape, art, that, they, saw, in, Buffalo,, New, York,, in, 1913,, and, impressed, with, its, affinities, with, the, Canadian, wilderness,, Harris, and, MacDonald, led, their, colleagues, in, aspiring, to, create, a, national, school, of, painting, founded, on, the, celebration, of, the, raw, pristine,  “northern”, character, of, much, of, Canada., Having, learned, about, the, natural, world, at, the, knee, of, a, distinguished, relative,, the, naturalist, William, Brodie,, Thomson, became, an, increasingly, competent, outdoorsman, and, the, indispensable, guide, for, the, group, as, its, individuals, made, extended, painting, forays, into, the, Ontario, wilderness,, especially, to, Algonquin, Provincial, Park,, about, 140, miles, (225, km), northeast, of, Toronto., Later, they, would, commission, a, railroad, boxcar, to, take, them, deep, into, northwestern, Ontario’s, remote, Algoma, region, and, on, to, its, stunning, vistas, of, Lake, Superior., Although, none, of, the, group, had, attended, the, famous, Armory, Show, in, New, York, City, in, 1913, that, effectively, introduced, North, America, to, modern, art, many, of, them,, through, study, or, travel,, were, well, aware, of, recent, trends, in, European, art,, and, as, they, developed, their, uniquely, Canadian, art, movement,, they, drew, from, influences, such, as, the, Post-Impressionism, of, Vincent, van, Gogh,, Paul, Gauguin,, and, Georges, Seurat,, the, Expressionism, of, Edvard, Munch,, and, the, Fauvism, of, Henri, Matisse, and, Maurice, de, Vlaminck., Usually, their, work, began, as, on-the-scene, “sketches”, (in, Thomson’s, case,, on, beaverboard, [fiberboard, used, in, construction]), that, were, refined,, transferred,, and, transformed, on, canvas, back, in, the, studio., They, largely, forsook, verisimilitude, to, instead, convey, expressionistically, their, emotional, response, to, their, subjects., The, group’s, paintings, were, frequently, characterized, by, the, use, of, bold,, bright, colors,, deployed, early, on, with, heavy, impasto, and, broad, brushstrokes, and, later, in, more, stylized, patterns, with, thinner, pigments., When, the, members, of, the, group—initially, lumped, together, as the, “Algonquin, Park, Group”—began, exhibiting, their, work,, Toronto, art, critics, were, much, less, than, kind, in, their, assessment, (garish,, affected,, and, freakish, were, the, words, used, by, a, Toronto, Star, reporter). However,, two, essential, patrons, emerged., Eric, Brown,, the, director, of, the, National, Gallery, of, Canada,, bought, paintings, by, the, group, for, that, institution., James, MacCallum,, a, Toronto, ophthalmologist, and, collector,, funded, the, efforts, of, Thomson, and, Jackson, for, a, time, and, then,, along, with, Harris,, financed, construction, of, the, Studio, Building, (1914), in, the, Rosedale, neighborhood, of, Toronto,, where, members, of, the, group, lived, and, painted, in, six, studios, (now, a, National, Historic, Site)., Thomson,, who, began, spending, more, and, more, of, the, year, in, the, wild,, lived, in, the, Studio, Building, briefly, and, then, occupied, a, specially, outfitted, shack, behind, it, for, several, years, (paying, $1, per, month, in, rent)., In, 1917—while, several, members, of, the, still, not, yet, formally, constituted, group, were, serving, in, the, army, during, World, War, I—Thomson, perished, mysteriously, in, Algonquin, Park,, having, drowned, after, seemingly, having, fallen, from, his, canoe,, though, more, recent, theories, conclude, that, he, was, the, victim, of, foul, play., He, died, before, the, formation, of, the, Group, of, Seven,, but, he, was, its, guiding, light, and, most, accomplished, member,, even, if, Harris, (whose, subjects, later, included, the, Rocky, Mountains, and, the, Arctic) would, go, farther, in, embracing, abstraction., Two, of, Thomson’s, paintings,, The, West, Wind, (1916–17), and, The, Jack, Pine, (1916–17),, remain, arguably, the, most, iconic, works, in, the, history, of, Canadian, art., Ultimately,, the, Group, of, Seven,, which, first, exhibited, under, that, sobriquet, in, May, 1920, at, the, Art, Gallery, of, Ontario,, comprised, Harris,, MacDonald,, Lismer,, Varley,, Jackson,, Johnston,, and, Carmichael., Before, disbanding, in, 1933,, the, group, would, also, include, A.J., Casson,, Edwin, Holgate,, and, L.L., FitzGerald., Five, of, its, members, are, buried, together, in, a, special, cemetery, on, the, grounds, of, the, McMichael, Canadian, Art, Collection, in, Kleinburg,, Ontario,, where, Thomson’s, shack, was, also, relocated., Learn, More, About, This, Topic, 1, What, and, where, is, the, Canadian, Shield?, 2, What, put, the, “post”, in,
