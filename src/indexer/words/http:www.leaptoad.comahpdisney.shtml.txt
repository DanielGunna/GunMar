[Disney, through, the, eyes, of, a, two-year-old, boy, Disney, fans!, Be, sure, to, read, about, Alex's, visit, to, Walt, Disney, World!, Contents:, Snow, White, Pinocchio, Bambi, Cinderella, Peter, Pan, Lady, and, the, Tramp, Sleeping, Beauty, 101, Dalmatians, The, Jungle, Book, The, Little, Mermaid, Beauty, and, the, Beast, Aladdin, The, Lion, King, Toy, Story, When, Alex, began, to, grow, tired, of, his, favorite, Sesame, Street, Video, his, next, discovery, was, Disney's, Toy, Story,, which, he, continues, to, refer, to, as, "The, Pig, Movie", after, one, of, its, lesser, characters., Toy, Story, eventually, led, to, The, Jungle, Book,, then, Peter, Pan,, and, so, on, and, so, on., Here, we'll, give, a, brief, description, of, 14, Disney, films, that, Alex, has, enjoyed, to, one, degree, or, another,, offering, the, perspectives, of, both, a, child, and, a, parent, who, have, enjoyed,, and, endured,, repeated, viewings, of, these, classic, films., While, Sesame, Street,, for, example,, is, certainly, more, educational, than, any, Disney, movie,, the, films, are, beneficial, in, another, important, way., They, stimulate, the, imagination., The, Disney, collection, has, introduced, Alex, to, pirates,, mermaids,, enchanted, castles,, giant, whales,, jungle, adventures,, and, so, much, more., There's, more, to, learning, than, knowing, numbers, and, letters,, and, Disney's, films, provide, a, sense, of, wonder, that, Sesame, Street, can, only, hint, at., All, kids, love, licensed, merchandise!, Alex, received, this, "Woody", doll,, from, Toy, Story,, on, his, second, birthday., Mouse, Works, Each, Disney, movie, also, has, a, companion, book,, published, under, the, banner, of, something, called, "Mouse, Works.", The, books, are, mostly, pictures,, with, an, overly, simplified, version, of, the, story., Alex's, interest, in, the, movies, led, him, to, have, an, interest, in, the, books., And, though, he's, too, young, to, read,, and, too, impatient, to, be, read, to,, he, enjoys, paging, through, the, books, and, narrating, the, story, based, on, the, illustrations., It's, not, quite, reading,, but, it's, a, good, start., We've, included, links, to, Amazon.com, for, a, number, of, the, books., If, you'd, like, to, order,, just, click, on, the, hyperlink, and, Amazon, will,, in, most, cases,, have, the, book, delivered, to, you, in, just, a, couple, of, days., The, Disney, Films, According, to, Disney,, every, movie, they, make, is, a, "classic.", However,, some, are, better, than, others., Here, we, will, take, a, look, at, Alex's, 14, favorites,, listed, in, the, order, in, which, they, were, made., Alex, discovered, each, movie, in, his, own, random, sequence., The, scary, witch!, Snow, White, and, the, Seven, Dwarfs, (1937), People, fall, in, love, quickly, and, easily, in, Disney, movies., Often, all, it, takes, is, to, see, somebody, of, the, opposite, sex, singing, a, song,, and, true,, eternal, love, is, the, immediate, result., That, trend, begins, in, Snow, White,, as, she, sings, a, song, with, a, handsome, goofball, near, a, well,, and, she's, head, over, heels., This, prince, of, hers, apparently, does, nothing, but, roam, through, the, forest, singing, love, songs., Ah,, well., We're, told, that, they, live, happily, ever, after., Snow, White, is, actually, a, bit, of, a, drip, herself,, so, perhaps, they, were, made, for, each, other., Disney's, first, movie, is, among, Alex's, favorites., He, seems, to, particularly, enjoy, evil, characters,, and, Snow, White, offers, the, "wicked, queen", and, the, "scary, witch.", The, film's, climax, effectively, manipulates, Alex's, emotions., After, Snow, White, has, bitten, the, poisoned, apple,, the, dwarfs,, thinking, she, is, dead,, weep, in, sorrow., Alex,, who, knows, the, names, of, all, seven, dwarfs,, narrates, mournfully:, "Happy, is, sad., Grumpy, is, sad., Dopey, is, sad., The, animals, are, sad., They're, sad, outside.", Then,, once, the, "handsome, prince", comes,, and,, as, Alex, puts, it,, "kisses, on", Snow, White,, Alex, is, every, bit, as, joyful, as, the, dwarfs, are., Buy, the, book, from, Amazon.com, Pinocchio, (1940), Pinocchio, has, not, managed, to, get, a, footing, among, Alex's, favorites., He, enjoyed, learning, to, pronounce, the, title, character's, name,, and, any, movie, with, a, large, whale, can't, be, all, bad., It's, a, classic, film,, to, be, sure,, but, since, Alex, has, not, given, it, much, attention,, we, won't, either., Buy, the, book, from, Amazon.com, Bambi, (1942), One, day,, when, Alex, was, suffering, from, a, fever, and, ear, infection,, he, watched, Bambi, three, times., Any, parent, who, has, to, watch, Bambi, three, times, in, one, day, has, probably, been, pushed, to, the, brink, of, insanity., Okay,, maybe, it's, not, quite, that, bad,, but, this, is, one, dull, movie, where, very, little, happens., Disney's, animators, show, off, their, considerable, skills,, setting, thunderstorms, and, gentle, rain, showers, to, music, in, long,, and, ultimately, boring,, sequences., Bambi, is, the, story, of, a, deer, who, is, born,, learns, to, walk,, and, then, grows, up., There's, a, little, bit, of, action,, but, it's, mostly, a, deer, frolicking, around, with, a, rabbit, and, a, skunk., The, most, poignant, scene, is, where, Bambi's, mother, is, killed, by, hunters., Bambi's, father, appears, in, the, swirling, snow, and, says,, "Your, mother, can't, be, with, you, anymore.", It's, unfathomable, how, any, child, could, see, this, movie, and, grow, up, to, be, a, hunter., Of, course,, in, the, very, next, scene,, it's, back, to, fun, frolicking., Bambi,, it, seems,, never, gives, his, murdered, mother, another, thought., Alex's, favorite, scene, is, near, the, end,, when, the, scary, dogs, come, and, chase, Bambi., As, we'll, see,, other, films, have, scary, dogs,, and, Alex, enjoys, them, every, time., Buy, the, book, from, Amazon.com, Cinderella, (1950), Cinderella, was, one, of, Alex's, later, discoveries., He, seems, to, like, the, funny, little, mice, (though, their, squeaky, voices, grate, on, his, mother's, nerves), and, the, nasty, cat,, Lucifer., It's, a, far, better, movie, than, Bambi,, but, that's, not, saying, much, at, all., Buy, the, book, from, Amazon.com, Fireplace,, more, commonly, known, as, Captain, Hook., Peter, Pan, (1953), For, weeks,, Alex, wanted, to, watch, nothing, but, "The, Alligator, Movie,", officially, known, as, Peter, Pan., He, would, get, most, excited, when, Wendy,, Michael, and, John, stepped, out, of, their, bedroom, window, and, flew, over, London., "Look!", he'd, shout., "They're, flying!", For, the, longest, time,, Alex, referred, to, Peter, Pan's, nemesis, Captain, Hook, as, "Fireplace.", Nobody, knows, for, sure, how, Hook, got, this, name,, but, theories, abound., Such, an, endearing, and, puzzling, misnomer, couldn't, last,, however., "Fireplace", eventually, became, "Kevin, Hook", and, then,, finally,, "Captain, Hook.", There, are, a, few, elements, in, Peter, Pan, that, might, be, considered, disturbing, by, some., Captain, Hook, casually, murders, two, of, his, men, in, cold, blood., (One, he, shoots, for, singing, in, the, crow's, nest,, the, other, he, throws, overboard, for, saying,, "No, splash,, captain?"), Also,, the, portrayal, of, American, Indians, is, blatantly, racist., (Check, out, the, musical, number, "What, Made, the, Red, Man, Red?"), If, any, other, ethnic, group, were, treated, this, way,, this, film, would, have, quietly, disappeared,, much, like, Song, of, the, South, has., All, things, considered,, Peter, Pan, is, a, charming,, entertaining,, and, imaginative, movie., After, about, fifty, viewings,, though,, Alex's, parents, began, to, find, it, a, bit, tiresome., Lady, and, the, Tramp, (1955), Oh,, thiiiiiiis, is, the, niiiiight..., This, is, a, good, movie., In, our, humble, opinion,, it's, one, of, Disney's, very, best., No, computer, animation., No, big, Elton, John, production, numbers., Just, a, simple, story,, well, told., The, backgrounds, wonderfully, evoke, a, small, early, 20th, Century, American, town., This, is, one, of, Alex's, favorites,, too., He, sometimes, goes, into, a, hypnotic, trance, when, "Darling", sings, "La, La, Lu.", There, are, scary, dogs, (a, term, always, pronounced, with, emphasis), that, chase, Lady., He, enjoys, the, scene, where, the, nasty, Siamese, cats, wreck, the, house, and, get, Lady, into, trouble., He, likes, the, scary, rat, who, appears, at, the, beginning, and, the, end, of, the, film., And,, thanks, to, an, early, line, by, Jock,, the, schnauzer,, every, dog, collar, Alex, sees,, on, the, screen, or, in, person,, is, a, "bonnie, new, collar.", One, of, the, most, memorable, scenes, from, Lady, and, the, Tramp, takes, place, in, an, alley, behind, an, Italian, restaurant., While, Lady, and, Tramp, savor, a, plate, of, spaghetti, and, meatballs,, they, are, serenaded, with, the, movie's, theme, song,, "Bella, Notte.", Alex, twists, his, mouth, and, purses, his, lips, when, crooning, "Bella, Notte.", He, knows, all, the, lyrics,, and, he, knows, when, to, hit, the, high, notes., It's, quite, a, performance!, It's, easy, to, tell, by, the, look, on, Lady's, face, that, she, is, falling, in, love, with, Tramp, while, eating, that, plate, of, spaghetti., Tramp, certainly, helped, his, cause, by, nudging, the, last, meatball,, with, his, nose,, over, to, Lady's, side, of, the, plate., It, would, be, so, nice, if, dogs, exhibited, such, nice, table, manners, in, real, life!, Imagine,, if, you, will,, the, same, scene, with, Lady, and, Tramp, behaving, as, real, dogs, would, when, presented, with, a, platter, of, spaghetti, and, meatballs., They, would, scarf, down, the, food, at, an, amazing, pace., There, would, be, plenty, of, gagging, and, snarling., And, long, after, the, food, was, gone,, they, would, both, be, licking, the, plate,, in, a, desperate, hope, that, there, were, some, microscopic, spaghetti, particles, remaining., Perhaps, it, for, the, best, that, the, folks, at, Disney, presented, the, scene, the, way, that, they, did., Buy, the, book, from, Amazon.com, Sleeping, Beauty, (1959), This, is, Disney's, best, fairy, tale, movie,, and, perhaps, its, most, under, appreciated, animated, feature., The, animation, is, stylish, and, the, backgrounds, are, extraordinary., And, the, evil, queen,, Maleficent,, is, about, as, wicked, as, anyone, Disney, has, dreamed, up., The, "Happy, Queens.", Fauna,, Merryweather,, and, Flora., Sleeping, Beauty, affected, Alex, like, no, other, movie., The, first, few, times, he, watched, it, he, would, get, so, excited, by, the, thrilling, climax, that, he, would, have, to, run, around, the, room, to, expend, his, pent-up, energy., Watching, Sleeping, Beauty, with, Alex, has, turned, out, to, be, one, of, life's, simple, pleasures., He, narrates, the, film, virtually, from, beginning, to, end., He, enjoys, the, three, fairies, (Flora,, Fauna,, and, Merryweather,, who, he, calls, "the, happy, queens"), the, scary, pigs,, and, the, prince's, battle, with, the, scary, dragon., The, story, is,, in, many, ways,, similar, to, Snow, White, and, the, Seven, Dwarfs,, where,, to, break, s, spell,, a, handsome, prince, "kisses, on", a, sleeping, maiden., But, Sleeping, Beauty's, Prince, Phillip, is, far, more, worthy, than, the, simpleton, that, won, Snow, White's, heart., Phillip, had, to, escape, Maleficent's, prison,, fight, his, way, through, a, number, of, obstacles,, and, slay, a, dragon, before, he, could, get, within, kissing, distance., We're, confident, that, Prince, Charming,, had, he, been, similarly, imprisoned,, would, have, simply, sat, in, his, cell, and, sung, songs, about, his, lost, love., Here's, Alex's, four-word, review, of, Sleeping, Beauty:, "It's, a, good, movie!", Buy, the, book, from, Amazon.com, 101, Dalmatians, (1961), How, could, any, kid, not, like, a, movie, with, so, many, dogs?, In, addition, to, all, the, Dalmatians,, there, are, several, dogs, of, other, breeds, as, well., Alex, laughs, out, loud, when, he, sees, the, cameo, appearances, by, several, of, the, characters, from, Lady, and, the, Tramp., (During, the, "Twilight, Bark", we, see, Jock, barking, up, a, drain, spout,, then, we, see, Peg, and, the, bulldog, in, a, pet, shop, window., Moments, later,, in, the, shadows,, we, see, Lady, and, Tramp, themselves, watching, a, car, drive, down, the, street.), Alex, is, also, spellbound, by, Cruella, De, Vil, (if, she, doesn't, scare, you,, no, evil, thing, will)., He, loves, the, scene, where, she, splashes, ink, all, over, Roger, and, Pongo., Cruella, is, a, fun, character, to, watch,, but, her, manners, leave, a, little, something, to, be, desired., And, she, should, probably, consider, taking, a, defensive, driving, course., 101, Dalmatians, almost, certainly, uses, the, word, "idiot", more, than, any, other, animated, feature., One, item, on, Alex's, mother's, "To, Do", list, is, to, count, how, many, times, the, word, is, heard, through, the, duration, of, the, film., To, save, her, the, trouble,, if, anybody, out, there, has, counted, the, "idiots",, or, would, like, to,, please, let, us, know, the, total., Thank, you!, Buy, the, book, from, Amazon.com, Four, "British, invasion", vultures, from, The, Jungle, Book., The, Jungle, Book, (1967), Another, big, time, favorite, of, Alex's., The, Jungle, Book, is, little, more, than, a, threadbare, plot, and, a, bunch, of, snappy, songs., And, it, works., It, can't, possibly, be, at, all, faithful, to, Rudyard, Kipling's, classic, story,, but, when, you, have, marching, elephants, and, singing, orangutans,, who, cares?, "Bare, Necessities", is, one, of, Alex's, favorite, songs, to, sing,, and, he, enjoys, marching, around, the, dining, room, table, to, the, Elephant, Brigade's, marching, songs:, The, aim, of, our, patrol, Is, a, question, rather, droll, To, march, and, drill, Over, field, and, hill, Is, a, military, goal!, It's, a, fun, movie,, but, be, warned:, After, a, few, viewings,, it's, very, hard, to, stop, those, songs, from, running, through, your, head., Buy, the, book, from, Amazon.com, The, Little, Mermaid, (1989), After, what, seemed, like, twenty, years, of, Rescuers, movies,, Disney, returned, to, its, glory, with, The, Little, Mermaid., It's, not, as, good, as, some, of, the, earlier, classics,, but, it's, a, lot, better, than, any, of, its, more, immediate, predecessors., Alex's, favorite, scene, comes, at, the, beginning, of, the, film,, where, the, scary, shark, chases, Ariel, and, Flounder, around, a, sunken, ship., Alex, also, enjoys, the, scary, octopus, lady., The, film, features, a, lot, of, colorful,, musical, fish,, and, what, kid, doesn't, like, musical, fish?, The, song, "Under, the, Sea", is, a, show, stopper., Buy, the, book, from, Amazon.com, Mrs., Potts, and, Chip., Beauty, and, the, Beast, (1991), Beauty, and, the, Beast, is, yet, another, film, with, scary, dogs,, which,, of, course,, Alex, can't, get, enough, of., In, an, early, scene,, Belle's, father, has, a, bad, run, of, luck., A, swarm, of, bats, causes, his, frightened, horse, to, run, off., "Poppa", is, then, chased, on, foot, by, a, pack, of, wolves, to, the, Beast's, castle,, where, he's, imprisoned., Alex, just, loves, this, sequence., He, even, told, a, waitress, in, a, restaurant, about, it., There, are, also, a, lot, of, cleverly, animated, household, objects,, led, by, a, clock,, a, candle,, and, a, teapot., According, to, Alex's, mother,, Beauty, and, the, Beast, is, the, best, of, the, recent, Disney, films., It's, an, observation, that's, hard, to, dispute., Buy, the, book, from, Amazon.com, Aladdin, (1992), Alex, calls, Aladdin, "The, Genie, Movie.", It, never, really, became, a, favorite., The, giant, stone, lion, that, emerges, from, the, sand, was,, perhaps,, a, bit, too, frightening, for, him., While, he, enjoys, seeing, "scary", things,, this, was, a, little, too, intense., Aladdin, probably, won't, age, as, well, as, most, of, the, other, Disney, films,, since, it's, full, of, topical, references, that, people, just, won't, "get", twenty, or, forty, years, from, now., It's, already, dated,, as, there's, a, reference, to, Arsenio, Hall,, who, virtually, nobody, remembers., Buy, the, book, from, Amazon.com, The, Lion, King, (1994), Alex, is, fairly, indifferent, to, Disney's, biggest, hit, ever., He's, attempted, to, watch, it, only, a, couple, of, times,, and, never, made, it, through, a, complete, viewing., Alex's, grandmother, doesn't, like, The, Lion, King, very, much, either., She, says, that, Simba, is, "a, little, brat.", Buy, the, book, from, Amazon.com, Toy, Story, (1995), "The, Pig, Movie,", as, Alex, calls, it,, is, one, of, the, most, original, and, entertaining, children's, movies, in, a, long, time., This, isn't, a, full-fledged, Disney, movie, -, a, company, called, Pixar, pioneered, the, computer, animation., It's, a, kid's, movie, that, adults, can, genuinely, enjoy., The, brilliant, animation, received, a, lot, of, attention,, but, it's, backed, by, a, solid, story, and, great, characterization., There's, a, sequel, due, to, be, released, around, Thanksgiving, 1999,, and, Alex's, father,, for, one,, can't, wait, to, see, it., Alex, will, enjoy, it, too., He's, never, seen, a, movie, in, a, theater,, and, Toy, Story, 2, may, turn, out, to, be, his, first., It's, easy, to, tell, that, Toy, Story, struck, a, chord, with, Alex., One, of, his, first, sentences, was, "To, infinity, and, beyond!", You, never, know, when, he'll, interrupt, a, conversation, to, yell,, "YOU..., ARE..., A..., TOY!, You're, not, the, real, Buzz, Lightyear!, You're, an, action, figure!, A, child's, plaything!", (For, those, of, you, who, haven't, seen, Toy, Story, a, thousand, times,, he's, quoting, Woody,, as, voiced, by, Tom, Hanks.), We, can, go, on, and, on, about, how, good, Toy, Story, is., But, we, won't., Buy, it, or, rent, it,, and, decide, for, yourself., Buy, the, book, from, Amazon.com, There's, more, Disney, fun, in, store, when, Alex, visits, Walt, Disney, World, in, Orlando,, Florida.]
