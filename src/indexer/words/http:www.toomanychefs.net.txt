[February, 3,, 2010, Brussels, Sprouts, Braised, in, Red, Wine, with, Bacon, and, Lentils, The, Observer, Food, Monthly, recently, ran, a, series, of, articles, addressing, the, somewhat, frivolous, question, of, what, do, celebrity, food, writers, or, chefs, eat, when, they, are, cooking, only, for, themselves?, What, is, special, about, solitary, meals?, It, is,, after, all,, the, dead, season, of, food, writing:, not, many, sexy, vegetables, are, in, season,, they've, finished, telling, us, what, wonderful, dishes, we, can, make, for, the, holidays, and, what, frugal, healthy, ones, we, can, prepare, to, make, up, for, the, holidays., And, it, IS, interesting, in, voyeuristic, kind, of, way., You, can, get, a, holier-than-thou, feeling, when, you, realize, that, three-star, Michelin, chefs, sometimes, eat, standing, over, the, kitchen, sink, too., In, the, end,, most, of, the, confessions, fell, into, two, categories:, simple, snack, food, that, wouldn't, usually, be, considered, a, proper, meal,, and, experimental, dishes., And, so, I, thought, of, the, article, earlier, this, week, when, I, was, making, my, solitary, meal., Like, the, others,, my, meals, on, my, own, tend, to, be, snack-like, (a, big, bowl, of, buttery, salted, popcorn,, cheese, and, crackers,, smoked, oysters, on, Triscuits,, heaven, help, me), or, else, they, involve, experimenting, with, some, ingredient, from, my, CSA, vegetable, box, that, I, know, the, rest, of, the, family, won't, eat., Like, Brussels, sprouts., (When, I, first, met, the, Critic,, he, insisted, that, we, make, Brussels, sprouts, at, Christmas,, though, he, refused, to, eat, more, than, one., Since, then,, he, has, dropped, that, senseless, idealism, and, we, get, by, with, only, four, vegetables, on, the, Christmas, table.), Usually,, these, solitary, dinners, made, of, unpopular, vegetables, are, tasty, enough,, but, nothing, to, write, home, about, -, nothing, worth, writing, about, here., And, then,, every, once, in, a, while,, I, stumble, upon, something, rather, good., As, I, did, this, week., If, you, like, Brussels, sprouts,, I, think, you'll, love, it., If, you, don't,, you, might, just, change, your, mind., It's, a, meal, in, a, bowl:, healthy,, hearty, and, just, plain, good., Looking, back, after, I, finished, it,, I, toyed, with, the, idea, of, adding, a, few, herbs, (thyme,, for, example), to, improve, it., But, in, the, end,, I, am, not, sure, it, needs, it., Really, good, bacon, is, essential, -, the, slices, I, had, were, thick, and, had, been, cured, a, good, long, time, to, give, a, nice, dry, texture., And, don't, cook, the, sprouts, too, long, or, they, will, smell, unappetizing,, get, soggy, and, put, you, off, forever., As, soon, as, they, turn, bright, green, you, should, test, one, for, tenderness, and, think, about, removing, them, from, the, heat., I, would, suggest, you, use, this, dish, to, convince, sprout-haters, that, they, can, be, delicious., But, then, it, would, no, longer, be, the, perfect, solitary, dinner., And, it, was, so, good, that, I'm, hoping, the, sprouts, will, still, be, in, season, when, my, next, box, arrives!, Continue,

is, a, problematic, vegetable., It's, not, very, pretty., And, although, it, has, a, subtle, celery, flavor,, it, is, easily, overpowered, by, other, flavors., Despite, many, recipes, floating, around, for, mashed, celeriac,, its, texture, really, doesn't, lend, itself, well, to, mashing., And, subtle, can, easily, fade, into, "dull", if, you, aren't, careful., The, classic, French, treatment, is, a, remoulade,, i.e., a, kind, of, a, celariac, coleslaw., It's, not, unpleasant,, but, it, lacks, the, crunchiness, of, a, good, coleslaw, and, rarely, has, enough, pepper, for, my, taste., So, what, do, you, do, when, it, turns, up, in, your, CSA, box, with, irritating, frequency?, I, have, mashed, it., I, have, made, a, gratin., I, have, paired, it, with, beans, for, a, hearty, soup., But, I, still, felt, I, was, missing, the, poor, vegetable's, potential, somehow., And, then, I, had, a, bit, of, an, epiphany., Lunching, with, a, friend, recently,, I, tasted, the, Waldorf, salad, that, she'd, bought., Until, then,, my, knowledge, of, the, great, Waldorf, Salad, was, confined, to, laughing, at, the, Waldorf, Salad, episode, of, Fawlty, Towers, and, paging, through, the, 1938, edition, of, The, American, Woman's, Cookbook,, which, I, inherited, from, my, grandmother., I, thought, the, idea, of, mixing, mayonnaise, and, apple, was, faintly, disgusting, and, best, avoided., And, yet...when, I, finally, tasted, the, supermarket, generic, salad, that, she'd, bought,, I, found, I, liked, it., The, flavor, combinations, worked, just, as, well, as, you, would, expect, in, a, recipe, that, has, stood, the, test, of, 110, years', time., And, so, I, thought, of, my, humble, celeriac,, waiting, in, my, veg, box, at, home., Celeriac, Waldorf, Salad., Perfect., And, it, is., Crunchy, and, savory, and, just, a, bit, sweet,, it's, a, very, satisfying, and, reasonably, healthy, lunch., I, have, to, admit,, though,, that, I'm, not, as, much, of, a, genius, as, I, thought, I, was, when, I, first, came, up, with, the, idea, of, using, celeriac, instead, of, actual, celery, in, a, Waldorf, Salad., A, quick, web, search, revealed, that, I, was, not, the, first, to, come, up, with, the, idea, by, far., But, that, does, not, make, it, a, bad, idea, -, far, from, it!, So, here, is, my, version,, coming, in, at, a, bare, 2, WeightWatchers, points, per, serving.,

the, Cranberry, Roll, Code, As, I, write, this,, cooks, in, the, U.S., are, waking, up, and, facing, a, full, day, of, Thanksgiving, fun:, baking, and, cooking, and, gossiping, with, family, and, friends,, looking, forward, to, a, feast., Living, outside, the, US,, I, don't, think, I've, cooked, a, Thanksgiving, feast, on, the, actual, day, in,, well,, 17, or, 18, years., This, year, was, no, exception:, we, had, our, bird, last, Friday,, before, the, Critic, flew, off, for, meetings, in, Tobago., (It's, a, hard, life, he, leads.), We, enjoyed, a, lovely, bird, from, a, local, farm,, with, cornbread, stuffing, (each, year, the, recipe, is, getting, closer, to, perfect),, bags, of, gravy, and, creamed, corn., And, cranberry, rolls., There, are, always, cranberry, rolls., However,, I, have, to, say, that, in, the, interest, of, saving, time,, I, committed, sacrilege., I, used, a, bread, machine., And, the, really, scary, part?, It, worked, better, than, when, I've, made, the, dough, by, hand., Yes,, this, is, no, compliment, to, me, as, a, baker., But, yes,, I, will, be, doing, it, again., And, I, will, also, now, know, that, when, I, am, making, the, dough, by, hand,, I, should, go, easy, on, the, flour., Because, this, is, the, crux, of, the, matter:, in, the, past, I, have, always, used, much, more, flour, than, the, original, recipe, called, for., When, you, are, kneading, the, dough, by, hand,, it, tends, to, stick, to, your, hands, and, so, you, reach, for, the, flour, bin., When, it's, in, a, non-stick, machine,, you, don't., The, recipe, calls, for, 4-5, cups, of, flour;, I, put, in, precisely, 4, 1/2, cups., And, when, I, turned, it, out, to, punch, it, down, and, form, the, rolls,, I, kneaded, in, no, more, than, half, a, cup, more., The, rolls, were, light, and, pillowy, and, just, plain, heaven, with, a, dollop, of, cranberry, sauce., So, if, you, are, in, a, hurry, this, Thanksgiving, morning, but, happen, to, have, a, bread, machine,, I, highly, recommend, you, give, this, recipe, a, spin., Your, taste, buds, will, thank, you,, as, will, your, friends, and, family., I, just, took, a, couple, dozen, to, my, youngest, son's, nursery, and, introduced, the, children, and, staff, there, to, them, and, came, away, with, far, fewer, than, I, expected., Actually,, the, best, compliment, is, this:, of, the, children, who, were, willing, to, try, the, rolls, (toddlers, are, extremely, suspicious, of, unknown, food), only, one, left, any, roll, on, her, plate., And, oddly, enough,, it, was, the, cranberry, filling, -, and, her, mother, snatched, it, up, and, ate, it, for, her!, Happy, Thanksgiving, everyone!, We, have, much, to, be, thankful, for, this, year, including, (but, not, limited, to, by, any, means):, good, health,, good, friends,, good, food,, a, President, and, first, family, we, can, look, up, to, and, be, proud, of,, money, in, the, bank, and, people, who, still, come, back, and, read, this, blog,, however, slow,

October, 17,, 2009, Spicy, Tomato, Salsa, Have, you, heard, of, the, "canvolution"?, Judging, by, some, of, my, favorite, blogs,, it, seems, to, be, sweeping, the, food, world, at, the, moment,, at, least, in, the, U.S., For, some, of, us,, it's, an, indulgence, in, the, latest, new, fun-thing-to-do-with-food., For, some,, it, hearkens, back, to, memories, of, how, our, parents, or, grandparents, lived., For, some,, it's, an, environmental, decisions:, buying, food, at, its, prime, and, preserving, it, means, less, need, to, ship, it, from, far, away, climes, or, force, it, out, of, season, in, energy-guzzling, greenhouses., And, for, me,, it's, all, these, things., When, I, first, read, Barbara, Kingsolver's, Animal,, Vegetable,, Miracle,, I, had, a, real, epiphany:, I, could, preserve, food, in, small, quantities,, and, for, the, most, part, with, equipment, I, already, owned., Yes,, I, would, need, to, buy, some, canning, jars, and, freezer, bags., But, by, judiciously, choosing, which, vegetables, to, preserve, and, how,, I, could, do, a, great, deal, to, reduce, my, carbon, footprint., Initially,, this, just, meant, flipping, through, my, cookbooks, and, consulting, with, the, organic, farmer, who, supplies, my, vegetable, box, each, week., We, had, a, very, symbiotic, relationship, this, summer,, with, me, offering, to, take, off, her, hands, any, vegetables, for, which, supply, was, overtaking, demand., She, threw, in, a, lot, of, vegetables, for, free,, too,, as, a, perk., As, a, result,, I, have, canned, apricot, jam,, tomato, sauce,, tomato, paste,, chopped, tomatoes,, marinated, peppers, and, pickled, onions., In, the, freezer,, I, have, bags, of, zucchini,, shelled, broad, beans,, runner, beans,, French, beans,, caramelized, tomatoes,, corn, and, grilled, eggplant, slices., However,, one, thing, you, may, notice, in, this, list, is, that,, with, the, exception, of, the, pickled, onions,, nearly, everything, is, simply, the, preservation, of, a, one-ingredient, item., And, then, I, suddenly, had, another, realization:, instead, of, buying, mediocre, Old, El, Paso, salsa, for, my, Tex-Mex, cravings,, I, could, make, and, can, my, own, salsa., Surely, the, acidity, of, the, tomatoes,, combined, with, a, dose, of, citrus, juice,, would, overcome, the, need, for, pressure, canning,, even, if, I, did, use, non, acidic, ingredients, such, as, garlic,, onions, and, peppers?, And, a, little, web, research, revealed, it, would., All, I, needed, to, do, was, pick, my, recipe., In, the, end,, I, decided, to, work, with, a, recipe, from, the, New, Mexico, State, University, website., I, don't, know, why, so, many, universities, seem, to, publish, books, and, online, recipes, for, canning,, perhaps, the, combination, of, young, energetic, people, and, scientists?, In, any, case,, this, page, has, a, half, dozen, fantastic, recipes., A, word, of, caution:, whenever, I, find, a, recipe, -, in, a, book, or, on, the, web, -, I, have, a, tendency, to, tweak, it, to, my, taste., This, is, a, dangerous, practice, if, you, are, canning,, because, a, slight, decrease, in, the, acidity, of, the, contents, of, the, jar, can, have, serious,, sometimes, fatal,, repercussions., The, most, I, am, willing, to, depart, from, a, recipe, of, this, sort, is, to, add, an, extra, clove, of, garlic,, and, even, then, I, compensate, by, adding, a, few, tablespoons, of, lime, juice., It, is, much,, much, better, to, be, safe, than, sorry., If, you, really, want, to, go, wild, and, make, changes,, I, suggest, you, invest, in, a, pressure, cooker, and, can, the, serious, way., For, myself,, I, much, prefer, recipes, that, only, require, boiling, in, the, �.50, gargantuan, iron, pot, I, picked, up, at, a, jumble, sale, a, few, weeks, ago., That, has, got, to, be, one, of, the, best, investments, in, my, cooking, life., (Though, I, really, do, need, a, round, cooling, rack, of, 22-23, cm, to, put, in, the, bottom, of, it, to, fully, utilize, its, surface, area., Anyone, have, a, suggestion?), The, recipe, I, chose, made, a, wonderful, versatile, sauce., How, hot, it, will, turn, out, will, of, course, depend, on, the, peppers, you, use,, but, mine, came, out, just, hot, enough, to, be, interesting, but, not, so, hot, that, you, reach, for, a, cold, beer, before, you've, swallowed., I, will, be, cracking, open, a, jar, to, enjoy, with, tortilla, chips,, adding, a, jar, to, beans, to, kick-start, a, chili, con, carne, and, even, using, it, for, a, quick, and, tasty, last, minute, dinner., Last, night,, I, set, some, brown, rice, boiling,, saut�ed, a, chopped, onion, in, a, little, olive, oil,, added, chopped, chicken, breast, and, about, 150, g, frozen, zucchini,, covered, it, with, a, jar, of, salsa, and, simmered, until, the, rice, was, done., With, a, grating, of, low-fat, cheddar, and, a, spoonful, of, low-fat, sour, cream,, it, made, a, hearty,, delicious, dinner, at, only, 8, WeightWatchers,

of, the, many, benefits, of, living, in, a, "socialist", (horror!), country, like, France, is, that, workers, are, genuinely, well, looked, after., Admittedly,, this, is, less, of, a, bonus, from, an, employer's, point, of, view,, especially, when, coupled, with, that, nasty, tendency, to, strike, and, the, near, impossibility, of, firing, an, incompetent, employee., However,, if, you, are, an, employee, -, competent, or, not, -, the, benefits, are, obvious., A, minimum, of, five, weeks, of, holiday, every, year,, in, addition, to, a, slew, of, public, holidays., Great, unemployment, benefits, should, the, impossible, occur, and, you, find, yourself, out, of, work., A, government, agency, whose, sole, purpose, is, to, help, you, find, a, job,, for, free., And, in, addition,, companies, are, obliged, to, either, provide, a, cafeteria, which, supplies, cheap,, healthy, food, or, give, their, employees, tickets, restos,, lunch, vouchers, that, can, be, exchanged, for, food, in, nearly, every, restaurant, in, the, city, and, many, supermarkets, too., Who, says, there's, no, such, thing, as, a, free, lunch?, I, was, woefully, unaware, of, this, issue, for, the, first, ten, years, I, lived, in, Paris, for, the, simple, reason, that, the, international, organisation, where, I, worked, had, a, snack, bar,, a, cafeteria, and, a, restaurant, on, site., When, I, went, to, work, for, a, French, law, firm, near, the, Champs-Elys�es,, I, was, surprised, and, delighted, to, find, that, in, addition, to, my, salary,, I, would, benefit, from, just, under, nine, euros, for, lunch, every, day,, rain, or, shine., Admittedly,, food, around, the, Champs, is, not, cheap, and, several, of, my, colleagues, complained, that, it, simply, wasn't, enough, for, a, "proper", meal., But, for, an, American, who, was, happy, with, a, nice, salad, or, sandwich,, it, was, plenty., I, generally, ended, up, with, a, dozen, or, more, of, them, left, at, the, end, of, the, year,, which, I, happily, distributed, to, the, homeless, population, of, Paris., They, were, happy, to, have, such, a, generous, donation;, I, was, happy, knowing, that, they, would, have, to, use, it, to, buy, food., Win-Win., I, spent, the, first, few, weeks, exploring, the, neighborhood, around, my, office,, scoping, out, the, caf�s, with, the, best, service, and, cheapest, good, food., And, I, found, my, local, -, complete, with, a, nice, grumpy, waiter, who, looked, out, for, regulars, like, a, trouper, -, on, the, avenue, FDR., I, won't, bother, giving, the, address, here,, because, the, last, time, I, was, there, it, had, changed, beyond, recognition, and, my, favorite, grumpy, waiter, was, gone., But, for, the, two, years, I, worked, in, the, neighborhood,, I, was, there, at, least, a, couple, of, times, a, week., And, at, least, once, a, week, -, until, I, got, pregnant*, -, I, had, the, World's, Best, Salad:, la, Salade, des, Landes., Seriously,, my, mouth, is, watering, just, thinking, about, it., Imagine, a, mixture, of, tender, lettuce, leaves, tenderly, dressed, with, a, tangy,, very, mustardy, vinaigrette., Add, sweet, tomatoes., Then, add, meaty, g�siers, confits, (preserved, gizzards, -, trust, me,, they, are, heaven, on, a, plate, and, not, at, all, gamey), and, magret, de, canard, (smoked, duck, breast)., Then, add, two, thick, slabs, of, foie, gras, and, hot, toast., All, for, just, under, nine, euros., Is, it, any, wonder, I, loved, that, place?, I, don't, miss, Paris, often,, but, I, do, feel, a, pang, when, I, remember, those, tranquil, (one, hour), lunches, with, no, children, pulling, on, my, sleeve, or, running, wild,, just, a, good, book, and, a, delicious, salad, for, company., Sigh., Not, that, I, don't, love, my, harum-scarum, boys,, mind, you,, but, I'd, love, a, tranquil, lunch, break, sometimes., And, on, that, note,, this, lovely, salad, was, consumed, to, the, sound, of, Tom, and, Jerry, on, the, computer,, two, year, old, shrieks, and, mayhem., But, it, was, still, delicious., No, foie, gras,, mind, you,, but, then, again, I'm, on, a, diet, nowadays., Weight, watchers, points:, 2., Win-win., *A, note, for, any, pregnant, visitors, to, France:, French, people,, including, restaurant, workers,, have, what, many, Americans, would, consider, a, somewhat, cavalier, attitude, about, food, safety, issues., Eggs, are, not, refrigerated, in, supermarkets, and, salads, are, -, frequently, -, cut, with, the, same, knife, that, just, finished, filleting, a, chicken, breast., On, the, same, unwashed, chopping, board., For, this, reason,, doctors, in, France, advise, pregnant, women, not, to, eat, salads, in, restaurants,, for, fear, of, toxoplasmosis, or, salmonella., At, home,, you, can, ensure, that, the, lettuce, is,

on), about, the, problems, posed, by, a, prolific, zucchini, plant., However,, here, in, England,, there, is, a, larger, problem., Runner, beans., My, understanding, is, that, these, lovely, plants, were, originally, cultivated, by, the, British, for, their, pretty, red, flowers., Then, one, day, someone, discovered, the, beans, were, just, about, edible., Fast, forward, a, couple, hundred, years, and, you, have, the, most, popular, vegetable, for, English, amateur, gardeners., It's, easy, to, see, why:, like, the, zucchini,, it, is, almost, impossible, to, mess, up., I, bought, a, half, dozen, plants, myself, earlier, this, year, and, planted, them, uncomfortably, close, in, pots., I, gave, them, minimal, sunshine, (because, we, are, renting,, I, have, placed, my, container, garden, on, the, side, of, the, house, that, has, a, bit, of, pavement,, to, save, the, grass), and, supports, that, were, about, three, feet, too, short., And, I, had, so, many, beans, that, I, ended, up,
