[TVWriter.Com, Larry, Brody's, Guide, to, Writing, for, the, Medium, Everyone, Loves, to, Hate, April, 12,, 2017, by, TVWriter™, @Stareable, –, “I’ve, got, to, have, contracts, for, my, web, series?!, Oh, nooo!”, So, You, Want, To, Make, a, Web, Series, –, Step, 6, by, Bri, Castellini, Filmmaking,, especially, at, the, indie, level,, is, a, largely, unglamorous, process., There, are, glamorous, aspects,, of, course:, hearing, your, words, read, aloud, and, performed, by, talented, actors,, the, thrill, of, a, well-composed, shot, that, raises, the, value, of, the, entire, project,, and, your, first, film, festival, acceptance, email., But, this, step, in, the, process,, focusing, on, cast, and, crew, contracts,, is, not, one, of, those., It, is,, however,, one, of, the, most, important, and, vital, things, you, will, hate, to, do., Stareable, recently, published, a, great, article, from, an, actual, lawyer, about, all, the, legal, considerations, you, should, keep, in, mind, when, writing, up, contracts., For, this, column,, I,, a, non-lawyer, whose, mother, really, wanted, her, to, be, a, lawyer,, will, give, you, a, pragmatic, perspective, based, in, experience,, not, legal, expertise., The, first, thing, you, need, to, know, is, that,, regardless, of, whether, you, are, paying, people,, you, need, a, contract, signed, (and, backed, up, in, two, places), from, every, member, of, your, team,, even, if, they, only, work, a, single, day., Not, because, your, friends, are, going, to, take, advantage, of, you, or, because, people, are, basically, rotten,, but, because, you, cannot, expect, other, people, to, take, your, project, as, seriously, as, you, do,, especially, without, significant, monetary, compensation., As, such,, their, thought, process, is, different, than, yours,, and, you’re, going, to, want, to, be, as, clear, as, possible, about, what, is, expected, of, them., Every, good, web, series, or, indie, film, contract, should, have, at, LEAST, the, following:, Clear, and, reasonable, expectations, and, responsibilities, If, they’re, an, actor,, how, many, episodes, are, they, acting, in,, how, many, shooting, days, will, that, require,, and, how, long, can, you, require, them, to, be, on, set, per, shooting, day?, If, they’re, crew,, same, questions,, plus, how, long, will, you, need, them, on, set, before, and, after, filming, wraps?, Are, they, expected, to, get, there, earlier, than, the, actors, and, stay, after, the, day, is, done, to, break, down, equipment?, Write, down,, in, as, specific, wording, as, possible,, everything, they, could, conceivably, be, expected, to, do., It, sounds, inane,, because, it, is,, but, these, sorts, of, things, will, save, your, butt, down, the, line, if, something, goes, wrong., Furthermore,, what, about, after, principal, filming, is, over?, Is, there, flexibility, if, you, need, a, reshoot,, or, if, a, day, takes, longer, than, expected, and, needs, to, be, split, up, into, two?, How, about, ADR, sessions,, or, additional, dialog, recording,, for, when, you, just, need, them, to, record, a, few, lines, of, dialog, later?, Will, you, be, filming, promotional, videos, with, them,, to, hype, up, the, season?, Do, they, need, to, be, involved, in, your, crowdfunding, campaign,, and, if, so,, what, level, of, involvement, is, needed?, Does, one, of, the, perks, involve, work, on, their, part,, are, they, in, the, initial, pitch, video,, or, do, they, need, to, be, in, a, fundraising, live-stream?, All, of, these, questions, and, contingencies, need, to, get, decided,, otherwise, they, have, free, reign, to, say, “it’s, not, in, my, contract,, so, I’m, not, doing, it.”, They, probably, won’t,, but, you, never, know,, and, that’s, the, point, of, a, contract., It’s, preventative., Compensation, If, you, can, pay, your, cast, and, crew,, this, is, where, you, outline, exactly, how, much,, as, well, as, if, it’s, a, flat, fee,, if, it’s, based, on, how, many, shooting, days, they’re, participating, in,, or, some, other, equation., You, can, also, opt, to, “defer”, payment,, meaning, that, your, cast, and, crew, agree, to, wait, for, payment, until, the, production, makes, x, in, profits, from, the, project,, at, which, time, they’ll, receive, a, pre-agreed-upon, rate., More, than, likely,, though,, you’re, broke, because, you’re, self-producing, a, web, series, and, we’re, all, broke., At, least, you’re, in, good, company!, In, this, case,, even, deferring, payment, might, not, be, an, option,, but, you, still, need, to, offer, something., Sometimes, the, compensation, for, work, will, be, as, simple, as, craft, services, (on-set, food), and, IMDb, credit,, but, you, still, need, to, outline, that., “For, the, work, agreed, upon, in, the, previous, section,, you, will, receive, x, by, [date]”, Usage, Once, the, web, series, is, completed,, where, does, it, go?, Are, you, considering, approaching, distributors, or, are, you, uploading, directly, to, YouTube?, Are, you, submitting, to, film, festivals, and, live, screenings?, Make, sure, you, have, an, agreement, up-front, about, where, you’re, allowed, to, post, episodes, and, if, you,, the, creator, and, producer,, have, total, authority, over, the, final, product, and, where, it, ends, up., If, you, end, up, making, a, distribution, deal,, it’s, going, to, be, helpful, to, have, signed, contracts, from, your, actors, giving, you, the, legal, authority, to, sign, over, the, rights, to, the, show, and, to, their, performances, or, work, in, it., Social, media, We’ll, talk, about, this, more, once, we, get, to, the, column, about, promotion,, but, it’s, worth, noting, early, on, that, even, actors, with, their, faces, all, over, your, project, will, be, bad, at, posting, about, the, show, to, social, media., You’re, making, a, web, series, and, your, audience, is, 100%, online,, so, the, more, people, posting, about, it,, the, more, likely, it, is, to, get, seen., As, such,, I, recommend, having, a, clause, in, the, contract, about, how, frequently, cast, and, crew, are, expected, to, post, about, the, show, or, about, new, episodes,, and, to, which, platforms., Once, again,, you, can’t, expect, anyone, else,, even, your, lead, actors,, to, take, your, show, as, seriously, as, you, do., Sometimes, you’re, going, to, have, to, lay, it, out, for, them,, especially, once, the, show’s, been, out, of, production, for, a, while, and, they’ve, moved, on, to, other, projects., There’s, a, completely, understandable, promotional, fatigue, that, sets, in, as, you, go,, which, you, might, even, run, into, yourself,, so, having, set, expectations, from, the, very, beginning, will, be, incredibly, helpful., And, another, thing:, Never, written, a, contract, before?, No, problem!, Just, Google, “film, contract”, and, mash, up, a, couple, that, you, find, until, you’ve, got, something, you’re, happy, with., The, most, important, thing, is, that, it, clearly, lays, out, everything, involving, expectations,, responsibilities,, and, compensation,, so, that, everyone, comes, away, from, the, project, happy, and, fulfilled., Now, that, you’ve, conquered, the, legalese, of, contracts,, we, can, finally, move, into, actual, pre-production,, where, we’ll, discuss, scheduling,, having, a, plan, B, for, everything,, and, the, indescribable, beauty, of, color, coding., Bri, Castellini, is, an, award-winning, filmmaker, as, well, as, the, Community, Liaison, at, Stareable,, a, hub, for, web, series.,

John, Ostrander, My, Mary, will, sometimes, pop, into, the, office, to, chat, a, bit., If, I’m, just, goofing, off, (a, lot, of, my, work, day, consists, of, goofing, off),, that’s, fine, but, if, I’m, actually, working, she, has, to, leave., She, understands, and, doesn’t, take, offense;, she, can, get, the, same, way, when, she’s, creating., I, don’t, want, anyone, looking, over, my, shoulder, when, I’m, working,, especially, with, the, initial, draft., I, get, self-conscious, and, everything, freezes, up, and, goes, away., Oddly, enough,, Kim, didn’t, always, understand, that., It, bothered, her, that, there, was, a, private, place, inside, me, to, which, she, was, not, invited., She, felt, a, couple, should, share, everything, and,, for, the, most, part,, I, agree, –, except, when, I’m, writing., I, suppose, that,, with, most, couples, that’s, also, true, to, some, degree., Perhaps, it’s, even, desirable, that, the, person, with, whom, you’ve, spent, a, good, long, time, can, still, surprise, you,, hopefully, in, positive, ways., I, once, wrote, a, Wasteland, story, in, which, the, husband, challenges, his, wife, when, she, claims, she, knows, him, completely., He, suggests, that, he, could,, in, fact,, be, the, serial, killer, they’ve, heard, about., The, claim, that, he, could, be, eats, away, at, his, wife, and,, by, the, end, of, the, story,, she’s, ready, to, leave, him, because, she, realized, that, the, doubt, she, is, feeling, indicates, she, doesn’t, really, know, her, husband, at, all., It, is, a, big, question., How, much, do, we, really, know, another, person, –, even, someone, that, we, know, intimately?, We, start, off, the, relationship, by, being, attracted, to, someone, which, may, lead, to, falling, into, what, we, think, of, as, love., I, would, suggest, that,, in, fact,, what, we’re, really, falling, in, love, with, is, our, construct, of, the, person., Someone, we’ve, invented, that’s, based, on, the, other, person, but, is, as, much, or, more, really, based, on, us, as, it, is, them., Hopefully,, as, time, goes, by,, our, perception, deepens, as, we, see, more, of, the, actual, person, and,, again, hopefully,, fall, into, more, of, a, true, love., That, gets, chancy., As, you, wind, up, really, seeing, more, of, the, other, person,, you, have, to, let, them, see, more, of, the, real, you., Brrr!, Pretty, scary,, boys, and, girls!, It, does, necessarily, involve, opening, up., However,, when, you’re, doing, something, creative, –, writing, or, art, or, what, have, you, –, the, process, can, be, very, private., It’s, a, mysterious, business, to, begin, with;, you, don’t, always, know, where, the, initial, impulse, comes, from, and, you, may, not, want, to, know., For, a, long, time,, I, resisted, any, idea, of, going, to, a, therapist, because, I, felt, that,, if, I, knew, more, about, my, creative, instinct,, it, would, vanish., In, reality,, therapy, turned, out, helping, quite, a, bit., I, understood, why, I, did, or, thought, some, things, and, that, understanding, actually, helped, me, creatively., Still,, I, don’t, want, someone, watching, me, create., I, may, need, to, dig, around, in, parts, of, my, psyche, that, can, get, a, bit, dark., (Those, of, you, familiar, with, my, work, can, probably, appreciate, that.), Nietzche, said, in, Beyond, Good, and, Evil:, “He, who, fights, with, monsters, should, be, careful, lest, he, thereby, become, a, monster., And, if, thou, gaze, long, into, an, abyss,, the, abyss, will, also, gaze, into, thee.”, Kim, and, I, used, to, describe, the, creative, process, as, bungee, jumping, into, the, abyss, and, pulling, out, something., Usually, it’s, squirming., I, don’t, need, observers, when, I, do, that., I, do, wind, up, revealing, aspects, of, myself, in, my, writing;, you, have, to., Every, character, you, write, must, in, some, way, be, you., However,, you’re, in, disguise;, you, can, always, claim, a, given, aspect, of, a, given, character, is, that, character, and, not, you., Keep, in, mind,, as, I’ve, warned, some, people, in, the, past,, that, I, may, appear, to, be, a, nice, guy, but, GrimJack, comes, from, somewhere, in, me., And, visitors, are, not, welcomed, there., John, Ostrander, is, one, of, LB’s, favorite, writers, in, any, medium., Don’t, forget, to, read, his, most, excellent, blog, at,

that’s, good, –, most, of, the, time., I’m, not, backing, off., BUT,, and, it’s, a, big, but,, there, are, times, when, we, writers, just, need, to, read., Maybe, we, need, to, do, some, research., Maybe, we, just, need, to, relax., Maybe, we, just, have, a, curiosity, that, could, lead, to, a, story., Whatever, the, reason,, the, plain, fact, is, writers, must, read., A, lot., Another, fact, is,, writers, frequently, are, broke., Certainly, at, least, the, ones, who, are, just, beginning,, or, doing, it, in, their, spare, time, until, such, time, as, they, can, make, a, living, writing., So,, this, go, round, I’m, going, to, share, with, you, some, sites, where, the, book, downloads, are, free., And, they’re, not, just, fiction, downloads,, though, some, of, those, can, be, very, good, as, well., Nope,, these, sites, include, things, like, reference, books,, papers,, maybe, magazine,, text, books,, that, fiction, I, mentioned, and, some, even, provide, links, to, more, sites, with, more, free, e-books., Yes,, there’s, a, lot, of, ‘junk’, out, there,, but, if, you, pay, attention, and, are, selective, it’s, possible, to, find, gems, without, spending, too, much, time, doing, it., So, read,, my, brothers, and, sister, of, the, page,, read!, In, no, particular, order, of, preferen:, Free, e-books.net, –, i.e., Free, Ebooks, for, Life!, https://www.free-ebooks.net/, There’s, a, sign, up, requirement, but, it’s, free, and, you, can, either, fill, out, their, form, or, sign, up, through, Facebook., They, offer, quite, a, ‘library’, from, fiction,, non-fiction,, academic, texts, and, audio, books., I’ve, poked, around, here, more, than, once., This, one, is, very, well, organized, and, pretty, easy, to, browse, categories, and, are, presented, in, list, form., Get, Free, EBooks, http://www.getfreeebooks.com/, It’s, not, quite, a, straight-forward, to, navigate, as, the, first, one, above,, but, it, certainly, isn’t, difficult, either., They, offer, an, assortment, of, fiction,, nonfiction,, etc., And, be, advised,, some, turn, up, as, ‘no, good’, (as, in, you, can’t, download, it, and, that’s, their, message), and, I’ve, spotted, a, couple, that, were, done, in, a, video, format, as, in, text, that, displays, on, a, screen, via, YouTube., Still,, again,, worth, a, quick, swing, through, if, you’re, looking, for, something, to, read., ManyBooks.net , http://manybooks.net/, It’s, pretty, easy, to, navigate, and, offers, a, wide, variety., There, are, classics, to, download, as, well, if, that’s, your, thing., Many, are, also, available, in, a, number, of, languages, –, just, click, “languages:, on, the, site, navigation, bar, to, get, a, list., The, Online, Books, Page, http://digital.library.upenn.edu/books/, The, site, is, pretty, bare, bones,, but, it’s, interesting., You, can, search, the, site, in, a, variety, of, ways, and, what, I, find, fascinating, is, they, frequently, come, up, with, very, old, texts, that, have, been, put, online, for, free, access., These, can, generate, some, fun, story, ideas., They, draw, from, many, sources., For, example,, there, was, a, pamphlet, available, lately, from, the, US, Library, of, Medicine, digital, collection, titled, –, “Man, and, woman, their, own, doctor,, or,, a, salve, for, every, sore:, being, a, book, full, of, rare, receipts, for, the, most, dangerous, distempers, incident, to, the, bodies, of, men,, women,, and, children, :, and, very, fit, to, be, in, all, families,, in, this, crasie,, sickly,, and, bad, times, :, gathered, out, of, the, library, of, that, famous, traveller,, Docter, Ponteous, ;, and, now, published, for, the, good,, and, benefit, of, all, people, whatsoever”, published, in, London, in, 1676.”, Really., The, Bottom, Line:, When, you, feel, the, need, to, read., These, can, be, pretty, good, resources., I’d, recommend, using, a, bit, of, free, time, to, explore, these, free, sites, and, trim, the, time, needed, to, find, what, you, need, at, a, later, date., Hope, the, sites, are, helpful, for, explorer-readers, everywhere., Enjoy!, Peggy, Bechko, is, a, TVWriter™, Contributing, Editor. Learn, more, about, her,
