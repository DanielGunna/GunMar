Application, Tips, Reasons, for, Denying, Requests, Reference, Sources, Overview, Getting, approved, to, edit, a, new, category, is, easy, if, you, take, the, time, early, on, to, learn, the, editing, guidelines., We, seek, to, promote, editors, who, have, a, record, of, adding, quality, to, the, directory., DMOZ, benefits, most, from, having, as, many, good, editors, as, possible, with, permissions, to, edit, in, broad, and, diverse, areas., If, you, add, quality, sites, and, lots, of, them,, then, you, will, be, systematically, granted, higher, and, more, diverse, editing, privileges., This, document, provides, some, advice, and, guidance, that, will, help, you, in, getting, additional, editing, opportunities., It, also, provides, a, basic, overview, of, the, "do's", and, "don'ts", of, editing., When, you, apply, for, a, new, category,, the, quality, of, your, current, categories, and, your, edit, history, will, be, evaluated., When, reviewing, your, editing, history, and, statistics,, please, keep, the, following, in, mind:, Every, application, is, evaluated, individually., Remember,, this, document, is, not, a, set, of, prescribed, rules., It's, only, advice., Your, application, will, be, reviewed, by, a, meta, editor,, category, moderator,, or, on, rare, occasions,, a, staff, member., The, most, important, factors, considered, are, the, quality, of, your, editing, and, expertise,, rather, than, the, quantity, of, edits, you, have, done., Quantitative, editing, statistics, vary, in, significance., Editing, numbers, are, important, because, they, give, a, representative, sample, needed, to, most, accurately, determine, the, quality, of, your, editing., Editors, may, be, accepted, to, high, level, categories, with, less, edits;, and, editors, with, thousands, of, edits, may, be, rejected, for, low-level, categories., Editing, stats, reflected, in, this, document, refer, primarily, to, additions, of, new, sites, and, edits, to, reviewed, sites., The, quality, of, new, adds, and, current, category, listings, are, very, important., Your, editing, stats, should, reflect, the, ability, to, Add, a, number, of, quality, sites, with, good, titles, and, descriptions., You, should, not, show, favoritism, toward, your, own, sites, or, sites, with, which, you, are, affiliated., Resolve, dead, links,, remove, spam,, affiliate, links,, and, other, types, of, sites, we, don't, list, Move, inappropriately, listed, sites, to, the, appropriate, categories, Clean, up, any, existing, site, annotations,, such, as, spelling, errors,, obvious, hyped, descriptions,, etc., Remember,, site, descriptions, should, not, read, like, sales, pitches, and, online, advertisements., They, should, objectively, describe, content, and, subject, matter., Keep, up, with, new, submissions, Organize, sites, into, an, intuitive, taxonomy, that, doesn't, duplicate, other, areas, of, the, directory., Prepare, useful, and, informative, category, charters, (if, lacking), Editing, Experience, What, type, of, editor, are, you?, Approval, of, your, application, is, dependent, upon, the, quality, and, diversity, of, your, editing, as, well, as, your, experience., This, section, gives, some, good, advice, about, choosing, categories, appropriate, for, your, experience, level., Editing, statistics, presented, are, not, absolute, requirements., They, are, presented, to, give, you, an, idea, of, the, rough, sample, size, needed, to, qualitatively, assess, your, edits., Beginning, Editors, A, "Beginner", is, generally, someone, who, has, one, or, two, small, categories,, and, is, still, learning, the, basics, of, the, directory, and, community., As, a, beginner,, it, pays, to, develop, good, editing, habits, early., You'll, save, yourself, from, doing, extra, work, if, you, do, things, correctly, from, the, start., Before, applying, for, a, new, category,, you, should, have, made, at, least, 20-30, total, edits,, and, should, have, added, several, new, sites., This, gives, a, minimum, representative, sample, for, us, to, gauge, your, understanding, of, the, editorial, guidelines., Your, edits, should, include, a, number, of, new, adds, so, we, can, get, a, sense, of, your, ability, to, select, quality, websites, relevant, to, your, category., Many, websites, look, nice, when, you, first, load, them,, but, have, no, content, beyond, the, first, page,, or, are, full, of, broken, links., Be, sure, to, look, past, the, first, page, before, adding, or, editing, sites, in, your, categories., Clean, up, the, categories, you, edit., Remove, spelling, errors, and, obvious, hype, from, descriptions., Every, site, should, be, consistent, with, the, directory, guidelines,, whether, or, not, you, added, some, sites, to, the, category., Consider, applying, for, categories, that, are, related, to, the, subject, of, your, current, category., Consider, applying, for, a, category, one, level, up,, or, at, the, same, level, in, the, hierarchy., Apply, for, categories, one, at, a, time., Get, each, category, into, top-notch, condition, before, moving, on, to, the, next., If, you, are, unsure, about, the, quality, of, your, edits,, ask, for, constructive, criticism, from, an, editor, in, a, parent, category, or, in, the, New, Editors, forum., If, you, receive, a, category, and, do, not, edit, in, it,, than, you, probably, won't, get, approved, for, an, additional, category., If, you, decided, not, to, edit, in, a, category, previously, granted, to, you,, then, resign, the, category, before, applying, for, a, new, one., If, you, are, approved, for, a, category, with, another, named, editor,, contact, the, editor, before, making, any, changes, to, the, category's, taxonomy., If, your, category, has, subcategories,, you, do, not, have, to, apply, to, edit, these, subcategories., Your, editing, privileges, already, extend, to, these, subcategories., Intermediate, Editors, An, intermediate, editor, is, someone, who, has, gained, experience, in, 2, or, 3, medium, sized, categories., By, now,, you, should, know, the, basics, of, editing., You, should, have, a, solid, record, of, adding, quality, sites., The, listings, in, your, categories, should, be, current, and, relevant, to, the, scope, of, the, categories., All, site, titles, and, descriptions, should, follow, the, guidelines., You, should, consider, broadening, your, editing, abilities, by, either, taking, on, larger, categories,, particularly, those, near, the, top, of, a, main, category,, or, editing, related, subject, matter, across, the, directory., Consider, building, a, specialty., Apply, to, edit, in, categories, across, the, directory, that, are, related, to, your, interests, (e.g., If, you, edit, in, Arts/Crafts/Textiles/, consider, applying, for, Business/Industries/Manufacturing/Textiles_and_Nonwovens/, or, Shopping/Crafts/Fiber_Arts/)., This, will, allow, you, to, become, familiar, with, the, nuances, of, editing, in, other, areas,, and, give, you, a, better, overview, of, the, directory’s, bigger, picture., Alternatively,, consider, gaining, responsibility, for, a, top-level, node, (e.g., Sports), or, a, very, large, second, level, category., At, this, stage,, it, will, help, if, you, continue, to, apply, for, categories, up, the, tree, or, across, the, node, (if, you, edit, in, Sports/Baseball,, consider, applying, for, another, Sports, category)., Advanced, Editors, An, advanced, editor, is, someone, who, has, obtained, a, relatively, high, level, of, experience, in, diverse, areas, of, the, directory., Advanced, editors, may, have, experience, in, one, large, category,, several, medium, sized, categories,, or, a, mixture, of, both., Remember,, edit, numbers, alone, will, not, necessarily, get, you, approved, for, higher, permissions., The, quality, of, your, edits, and, the, diversity, of, your, experience, are, the, most, important, factors., Consider, taking, on, larger, categories, within, the, areas, you, edit., If, you, have, limited, yourself, to, a, single, node,, consider, applying, for, the, top, level, or, larger, and, more, complex, second, tier, categories., If, you, have, edited, in, a, number, of, categories, across, the, directory,, consider, picking, one, area,, and, apply, for, one, of, the, largest, categories., While, becoming, an, editor, of, a, large, category, is, not, a, requirement, for, further, permissions,, it, exposes, you, to, several, opportunities, and, will, lead, to, a, better, understanding, of, larger, directory, issues., Editing, experience, in, large, or, more, diverse, areas, is, helpful, in, getting, permissions, to, edit, anywhere, in, the, directory., While, some, “advanced, editors”, have, several, thousand, edits, or, even, tens, of, thousands, of, edits,, getting, denied, for, a, new, permission, is, not, uncommon., No, matter, how, experienced, you, are,, you, will, only, be, considered, for, the, uppermost, tiers, of, top, level, categories, if, you, have, some, experience, in, the, hierarchy, for, which, you, are, applying., So,, if, you, have, 3,000, edits,, and, are, listed, near, or, at, the, top, of, Business, and, Shopping,, you, won't, necessarily, get, approved, at, an, equivalent, level, in, Regional., However,, if, you, have, amassed, a, few, thousand, edits,, and, want, to, branch, off, into, other, areas, in, this, manner,, you, should, consider, applying, for, “editall”, permissions., Also,, you, can, have, tens, of, thousands, of, edits,, but, if, you, have, a, record, of, poor, editing,, poor, communication,, an, inability, to, work, cooperatively, with, others,, and, do, not, appear, conscientious, about, adding, quality, sites, with, good, titles, and, descriptions,, then, you, probably, won’t, get, approved, for, any, additional, permissions, until, you, have, demonstrated, improvement., Finally,, remember, to, clean, up, your, dashboard., If, you, are, named, to, categories, where, you, are, no, longer, actively, editing,, including, top, level, categories,, please, resign, from, them, before, applying, for, additional, categories., Before, You, Apply, -, A, Checklist, Before, you, apply, for, a, new, category,, take, some, time, to, make, sure, that, the, categories, you, edit, are, in, good, shape, and, consistent, with, the, directory, guidelines., Some, categories, have, additional, guidelines, governing, their, content., Other, areas, with, very, specific, guidelines, include, Regional,, Kids, and, Teens,, and, Adult., This, may, seem, like, a, lot, of, work,, but, getting, approved, for, a, new, category, is, actually, very, easy, if, you, remember, to:, edit, fairly,, objectively,, and, never, abuse, take, time, early, on, to, learn, the, editing, guidelines,, and, show, that, you, can, follow, them, use, common-sense, judgment, The, condition, of, your, categories, provide, the, best, indicator, of, the, quality, you, are, adding, to, the, directory., Here, are, some, points, to, review, before, you, submit, an, application, for, another, category., Link, Quality, and, Organization, Have, you, been, adding, inappropriate, sites, to, your, categories,, such, as, mirrors,, redirects,, affiliate, links,, and, spam?, Are, there, any, of, these, kinds, of, sites, listed, in, your, category?, If, so,, get, rid, of, them., Have, you, listed, sites, that, are, too, broad,, too, narrow, or, otherwise, not, directly, relevant, to, the, scope, of, your, category?, If, so,, find, a, more, appropriate, home, for, them., If, you, have, created, subcategories, to, organize, your, sites,, does, the, ontology, make, sense?, Are, the, category, names, appropriate, and, informative?, Do, the, subcategories, duplicate, categories, existing, elsewhere, in, the, directory?, Errors, of, this, type, will, likely, result, in, the, denial, of, your, application., Have, you, cooled, your, own, site?, Cooling, your, own, site, or, ones, with, which, you, are, affiliated, is, not, permitted., Quality, of, Site, Annotations, Have, you, reviewed, the, directory, guidelines,, and, checked, the, quality, of, your, site, annotations?, Please, review, and, correct, the, entire, category,, not, just, your, own, edits., If, it, is, a, large, and, complex, category,, review, the, parts, in, which, you, actively, edit., Do, the, sites, in, your, categories, have, inappropriate, titles?, (i.e.,, all, capitals, words,, exclamation, points,, or, "Welcome, to", and, "Home, Page", phrases.), If, they, do,, fix, them, even, if, you, didn't, add, them., Are, the, sites, well, described?, Each, description, should, provide, an, objective, summary, of, the, site's, contents, and, subject, matter,, not, a, sales, pitch,, online, advertisement,, review,, rating, or, personal, opinion., Every, site, should, have, a, description., Do, the, descriptions, follow, basic, rules, for, spelling,, grammar,, capitalization,, and, punctuation?, Are, any, URLs, indexed, more, than, once, in, your, category?, Generally,, a, single, URL, should, be, listed, only, once, in, a, branch., Are, you, following, any, special, guidelines, and, standards, that, apply, to, the, categories, you, edit?, For, example,, the, Regional, guidelines,, or, the, Music/Bands_and_Artists, standards?, Communication, and, Conduct, Have, you, received, any, warnings, about, repeated, poor, editing, or, abuse?, You, won't, be, approved, for, additional, categories, until, you, demonstrate, improvement., Do, you, get, along, well, with, others?, Do, you, have, your, co-editors, complaining, and, asking, for, mediation?, Do, you, ignore, email, from, your, co-editors, when, they, ask, why, you, changed, things, in, the, category?, Do, you, ignore, email, from, senior, editors, when, they, try, to, mediate, a, situation?, Have, you, initiated, major, changes, to, your, category, without, discussing, them, with, your, co-editors?, If, so,, please, wait, to, apply, until, you, have, demonstrated, that, you, can, be, part, of, the, "team.", Application, Tips, The, application, for, a, new, permission, is, pretty, self-explanatory., However,, here, some, helpful, tips, that, will, increase, your, chances, of, getting, approved., Choosing, a, Category, to, Edit, Some, areas, of, the, directory, have, few, editors, and, significant, room, for, development., A, neglected, corner, of, the, directory, can, allow, you, a, tremendous, opportunity, to, stand, out, as, a, good, editor., No, matter, how, experienced, you, are,, you, are, more, likely, to, be, approved, for, categories, that, need, help., If, you, are, applying, to, an, area, of, the, directory, where, you, have, little, or, no, experience,, it's, always, best, to, start, small., This, is, particularly, true, when, you, are, applying, to, edit, in:, A, new, language., A, hierarchy, unrelated, to, your, prior, experience., A, part, of, the, directory, with, specialized, guidelines., A, part, of, the, directory, with, unusual, submission, problems., A, part, of, the, directory, with, particularly, complicated, taxonomy., Reason, Give, a, brief, reason, for, wanting, to, edit, the, category., You, don't, have, to, come, up, with, something, clever, and, profound, here., Just, share, your, interests., If, there, are, special, circumstances,, then, please, state, them., For, example,, some, editors, join, to, clean, up, or, organize, a, category., If, you, are, applying, in, response, to, a, 'help, wanted', thread, be, sure, to, note, that, in, the, "reason", area., If, another, editor, has, suggested, that, you, request, a, category,, name, the, editor., If, you, are, applying, to, clean, up, a, poorly, edited, category,, please, note, that, with, your, application., Please, include, specific, examples, of, the, problems, you, intend, to, correct., Affiliations, Please, give, any, affiliations, you, have, with, any, site, that, may, be, listed, in, the, category, or, one, of, its, subcategories., By, affiliation, we, mean, a, site, that, belongs, to, you,, your, employer,, your, client,, etc., It, is, important, for, you, to, be, honest., Just, because, you, have, a, self-interest, doesn't, mean, your, application, will, get, denied., You'll, only, be, denied, if, you, show, favoritism,, and, you, will, be, removed, if, you, have, been, dishonest, about, your, affiliations, and, favored, these, listings., Provide, Sample, URLs, Part, of, the, application, process, is, to, provide, proposed, URLs, with, sample, titles, and, descriptions., Please, provide, all, requested, information, no, matter, how, experienced, or, qualified, you, are., The, provision, of, URLs, allows, us, to, Evaluate, your, understanding, of, the, scope, of, the, category., Review, your, understanding, of, any, specific, rules, that, may, apply, in, the, new, category., Reflect, on, your, understanding, of, the, general, editorial, guidelines., Common, Reasons, for, Denying, Applications, The, following, are, common, reasons, why, we, deny, requests, for, new, category, permissions., These, factors, are, listed, in, order, of, importance., You, are, adding, sites, we, don’t, list, in, the, directory, or, those, of, very, poor, quality., You, are, deleting, perfectly, good, and, useful, sites, without, any, reasonable, explanation., You, are, adding, sites, that, are, not, directly, relevant, or, out, of, scope, of, the, category., You, are, adding, sites, to, a, subcategory, that, are, already, indexed, in, the, parent, category., You, are, creating, categories, that, duplicate, those, which, already, exist, elsewhere, in, the, directory., Your, edits, frequently, contain, spelling,, grammatical,, or, other, typographical, errors., Your, titles, and, descriptions, are, not, consistent, with, the, directory, and, category-specific, guidelines., You, were, recently, denied, for, the, same, category,, and, there, is, no, obvious, change, in, circumstances, since, the, time, of, that, denial., You, are, unable, to, work, well, with, co-editors,, particularly, in, matters, of, category, management, (e.g., you, have, made, major, organizational, changes, without, their, input)., Your, application, will, be, denied,, and, you, will, risk, reduction, or, loss, of, editing, privileges,, if, you:, Demonstrate, self-serving, editing., (You, have, cooled, your, site,, you, are, manipulating, descriptions, by, deleting, keywords, from, competition, or, keyword, padding, your, own, or, an, affiliate, site, to, improve, search, ranking,, or, you, are, deleting, good,, valid, and, working, URLs, that, belong, to, competitors)., Demonstrate, click-through, editing:, you, are, adding, links, using, meta, tag, information,, or, show, that, you, never, bothered, to, review, the, site, you, are, listing., Create, vanity, categories, to, highlight, your, own, website, or, serve, your, own, interests., Mirror, another, portion, of, the, directory, because, you, don't, have, permission, to, edit, there., Add, non-English, language, sites, in, English, language, categories, rather, than, sending, them, to, the, World/, hierarchy., Add, English, language, sites, in, the, World/, hierarchy,, or, add, sites, to, World/, categories, with, English, language, descriptions., Add, Adult, sites, outside, of, the, Adult, branch, (the, Adult, Guidelines, define, what's, included, in, the, Adult, branch)., Delete, necessary/appropriate, @links, (symlinks), or, related, category, links, from, the, categories, you, edit, without, the, consensus, of, other, affected, editors., "Collect", categories, -, i.e., you, have, a, lot, of, subcategories, on, your, dashboard,, even, though, you, edit, the, parent, category,, or, are, holding, onto, categories, where, you, no, longer, edit., What, to, Do, if, Your, Application, Gets, Denied, Review, the, checklist, above, and, the, common, reasons, for, denying, an, application., Take, a, second, look, at, your, category., Every, effort, is, made, to, send, you, feedback, giving, reasons, for, denying, your, application., If, you, need, additional, feedback,, contact, the, meta, or, catmod, who, processed, your, request., If, you, look, at, your, request, log, (e.g., type, in, http://www.dmoz.org/editors/log/requestlog?editor=username, -, substitute, username, for, your, editor, name;, there, is, a, link, to, this, in, your, editor, side, profile),, you, will, find, out, who, accepted/rejected, you, for, a, category., If, you, aren't, getting, a, response, from, the, person, who, processed, your, application,, post, in, the, "I, got,
