Ph.D., The, Costumer's, Manifesto:, (A, statement, of, Purpose, and, Ethics, for, Costumers), "I, am, a, Costumer,, I, make, clothes, for, imaginary, people.", ---Celestine, Ranney,, 1982, When, I, costume,, I, am, not, a, fashion, designer, nor, a, clothing, manufacturer,, but, a, builder, of, character,, concept,, and, physical, movement., I,, above, all,, work, with, Actors:, I, help, them, build, their, character, from, without,, even, as, they, build, it, from, within., I, do, not, complain, about, the, shape, of, their, bodies., I, create, the, shape, we, need,, and/or, build, a, visual, representation, of, the, character, that, suits, the, existing, body., I, am, aware, of, their, movement, needs, and, I, facilitate, them., I, work, under, the, guidance, of, Directors:, I, help, them, visually, represent, their, conceptual, ideas, in, physical, form., I, create, clothes, for, the, inhabitants, of, the, world, they, envision., I, am, inspired, by, the, words, of, Playwrights, and, Scriptwriters:, I, try, to, bring, alive, the, script, by, transforming, the, words, of, the, text, into, visual, metaphors., Words,, especially, poetry, in, the, text,, need, a, visual, equivalent, that, supports, the, mood, of, the, script, without, distracting, from, it., I, collaborate, with, the, other, Designers,, seeking, to, bring, our, collective, vision, together, so, it, works, in, harmony., Costumes, do, not, exist, in, a, vacuum,, but, on, a, set,, among, properties, and, furniture,, sound,, and, light,, as, part, of, a, consistent, visual, representation, of, an, invented, world., Whether, I, am, in, the, position, of, stitcher,, cutter,, dyer,, crafts, worker, or, designer,, I, remember, that, what, I, am, doing, is, contributing, to, the, greater, whole, of, the, production,, and, must, be, done, with, an, aesthetic, sense, in, keeping, with, the, performance,, not, merely, my, own, whims., Designers,, therefore,, need, to, communicate, the, shows, design, to, all, the, other, costumers, involved, in, the, process, as, clearly, as, possible,, so, that, when, design, decisions, are, made, at, any, level, of, the, process,, from, buttons, to, butt, padding,, they, reflect, the, needs, of, the, show, or, film, as, a, whole., I, assist, the, Audience, in, understanding, the, story, and, characters., In, performances, where, spectacle, is, required,, I, make, the, costumes, astonish, and, entertain,, but, when, the, audience, should, be, more, aware, of, the, other, elements, of, the, performance,, I, will, try, to, make, the, costumes, recede, to, the, background,, without, personal, vanity., I, study, the, history, of, fashion, and, dress,, no, matter, what, my, position, in, a, costume, studio,, so, that, I, can, better, replicate, the, styles, of, clothing, of, the, past, when, needed., However,, I, will, remember, to, avoid, mindlessly, copying, old, fashion, plates,, but, instead, keep, in, mind, the, key, elements, of, character, and, concept,, and, select, or, adapt, those, fashions, to, suit, the, individual, production., I, am, aware, that, my, work, consists, primarily, of, adapting, and, reinventing, pre-existing, styles, to, do, a, functional, purpose:, cover, a, body., I, know, then, that, what, I, build, is, not, legally, subject, to, copyright, law,, and, I, will, not, winge, and, whine, if, another, designer, is,, in, turn,, inspired, to, reuse, elements,, even, a, majority, of, those, elements,, from, one, of, my, designs, in, their, work., I, will, accept, this, as, flattery, if, anyone, does, so., Costuming, is, a, fun, profession,, and, I, endeavor, at, all, times, to, keep, it, that, way, by, remembering, the, feelings, of, all, my, collaborators., At, no, time, should, actors, feel, their, bodies, are, being, criticized, in, a, fitting,, nor, should, a, student,, worker, or, volunteer, be, treated, as, slave, labor,, nor, should, a, director, or, another, designer, be, bullied, into, an, unwanted, design, decision., A, desire, for, excellence, is, good,, but, the, desire, should, never, be, pursued, to, any, degree, that, ignores, labor, law,, common, courtesy, or, civilized, collaboration., Tara, Maginnis,, 8/18/2002, Questions, Buy, Books, and, More, About, Me, Retrieved, from,
