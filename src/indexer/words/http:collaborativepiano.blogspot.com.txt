March, 24,, 2017, Farewell, Talisker, Players, Some, sad, news, from, Toronto, - Musical, Toronto, reports, that, Talisker, Players, will, be, ceasing, operations, at, the, end, of, the, concert, season., For, 17, seasons,, Talisker, Players, has, been, a, leading, proponent, of, vocal, chamber, music,, and, has, commissioned, 30, works, since, 1999., From, the, Musical, Toronto, article:, “With, an, organization, like, this,, they, do, have, a, lifespan…, and, eventually, you, feel, as, though, you’ve, done, what, you’ve, wanted, to, do,”, said, Talisker, Players, Artistic, Director, Mary, McGeer, in, a, phone, interview., “The, close, of, our, season, in, May, 2017, seems, like, the, right, moment, to, move, on,, to, explore, new, horizons,, and, to, embrace, new, projects.” , McGeer, clarified, that, the, decision, was, not, related, to, any, financial, difficulty,, and, the, Talisker, Players, were, proud, to, end, operations, with, “an, unbroken, record, of, balanced, budgets.”, A, few, videos, that, show, the, kind, of, material, that, Talisker, excels, at:, a, magnificently, bearded, Doug, MacNaughton, is, joined, by, James, McLennan, in, Flanders, &, Swann's, The, Hippopotamus, Song:, Tenor, James, McLennan,, clarinetist, Peter, Stoll,, and, pianist, Peter, Longworth, perform, Leslie, Uyeda's, Radishes,, with, words, by, Lorna, Crozier:, Talisker's, final,

Videos, Thursday,, March, 23,, 2017, Should, You, Be, Dressing, Down?, In, many, of, the, schools, of, music, that, I've, visited, in, the, last, while,, there's, a, lot, of, dressing, down, going, on., Has, anyone, else, noticed, this?, Tyler, Cowan, (of, the, highly, influential, Marginal, Revolution), writes, in, Business, Insider, about, the, practice, of, marking, status, through, countersignaling:, Countersignaling, is, when, you, go, out, of, your, way, to, show, you, don’t, need, to, go, out, of, your, way., The, boss, doesn’t, have, to, wear, a, tie, or, even, dress, up. , If, he, did,, that, would, suggest, he, had, something, to, prove,, which, would, be, a, negative, rather, than, a, positive, impression , The, next, step, is, that, the, vice, presidents, also, don’t, have, to, dress, up,, and, soon, enough, most, of, the, company, doesn’t, have, to, dress, up., This, is, all, very, groovy,, but, what, do, you, do, if, you're, a, recent, graduate, working, in, the, music, profession, and, you, want, to, get, ahead?, It's, not, so, simple., Tyler, continues:, If, you’re, 24, years, old, and, looking, to, get, ahead,, it, can, be, tougher.,   , There, isn’t, such, a, simple, way, to, visually, demonstrate, you, are, determined, to, join, the, ranks, of, the, upwardly, mobile., Looking, smart, on, “casual, Friday”, may, get, you, a, better, date,, but, the, boss, will, not, sit, up, and, take, notice., In, other, words,, a, culture, of, the, casual, is, a, culture, of, people, who, already, have, achieved, something, and, who, already, can, prove, it., It, is, a, culture, of, the, static, and, the, settled,, the, opposite, of, Tocqueville’s, restless, Americans...., ...The, young, and, ambitious, really, can, set, themselves, apart, from, the, slackers,, even, if, doing, so, looks, conformist, and, stifling, when, multiplied, and, observed, on, a, larger, scale., Societies, of, upward, mobility,, when, based, on, large, and, growing, business, enterprises,, look, and, feel, somewhat, oppressive., Much, as, many, of, us, might, not, want, to, admit, it,, the, casual, and, the, egalitarian, are, closer, to, enemies, than, to, allies., But, I, suppose, it, never, hurts, to, slightly, overdress, for, a, professional, occasion,, even, if, it, marks, you, as, being, one, of, the, over-ambitious, ones., Posted, by, Chris,

back, with, John, Adams, conducting., Posted, by, Chris, Foley, at, 1:11, PM, 0, comments, Labels:, Chamber, Music,, Videos, Monday,, March, 20,, 2017, The, Origin, of, the, Term, "Collaborative, Pianist", Might, Not, Be, What, You, Think, It, Is, Some, recently, unearthed, information, casts, some, doubt, on, the, commonly, held, assertion, that, Samuel, Sanders, coined, the, term, "collaborative, pianist"., Here's, a, comment, from, Aine, Mulvey,, who, has, unearthed, scholarly, work, of, Hamilton, Harty,, who, used, the, term, "collaborator", all, the, way, back, in1930:, Hi,, I'm, an, Irish, Ph.D., student,, currently, researching, Hamilton, Harty,, who, was, a, leading, accompanist, in, London, in, the, early, 1900s., He, disliked, the, term, 'accompanist', and, wrote, a, paper, on, 'The, Art, of, Pianoforte, Accompaniment', in, 1930,, in, which, he, argued, that, 'collaborator', would, be, a, more, accurate, term., I, think, it, may, be, the, first, use, of, the, term..., I, was, curious,, as, it, hasn't, really, caught, on, over, here, although, I've, heard, it, used, in, conservatories, in, the, States, and, in, Italy., I, was, doing, some, internet, research, to, see, if, there, was, an, earlier, mention, of, the, term, or, if, Harty, coined, it., I, think, he, pre-dates, Samuel, Sanders?, What, about, the, first, mention, in, the, New, York, Times?, A, quick, search, on, the, Times, site, reveals, that, the, first, NYT, mention, is, from, none, other, than, Joseph, Horowitz, in, a, 1978, review and, is, in, relation, to, not, Samuel, Sanders,, but, Albert, Lotto:, The, program, also, included, the, Debussy, sonata, and, Brahms's, Trio, in, B, (Op., 8)., Albert, Lotto, was, the, strong,, richly, collaborative, pianist, in, the, Beethoven, and, Brahms, works,, and, Carol, Stcin, Amado, was, the, capable, violinist., It, seems, to, me, that, Joseph, Horowitz's, words, are, in, regards, to, how, well, Albert, Lotto, played, in, the, ensemble, rather, than, what, he, did, for, a, living., But, might, Samuel, Sanders, have, come, across, this, article, and, might, Joseph, Horowitz's, wording, of, this, review, have, influenced, Sanders', eventual, desire, to, rebrand, the, accompanying, profession, a, year, or, two, later?, Posted, by, Chris, Foley, at, 7:23, AM, 0, comments, Labels:, Collaborative, Piano,, News,
