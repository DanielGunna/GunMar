B-side,, Woo, Hoo, Let, me, preface, this, post, a, bit., Shortly, after, I, made, the, last, post, bad, things, started, to, happen., They, say, bad, things, come, in, threes,, right?, Well,, first, my, laptop, broke., That's, the, only, problem, that, effects, you, in, any, way, I, guess;, it's, hard, to, post, about, new, music, with, no, computer, or, access, to, digital, music., So, that, kind, of, sucks., Then, there, are, a, couple, slightly, more, painful, problems., First,, I, dislocated, my, shoulder, in, a, soccer, match., Normally, I, would, just, be, like,, whatever,, but, I'm, on, scholarship, and, have, to, report, to, school, for, soccer, exactly, one, month, from, tomorrow., So, I, have, a, dislocated, shoulder, now., Whatever,, I, can, still, train..., Right?, Well,, not, so, much., I, found, out, a, couple, days, ago, that, I, also, have, mono., Now, my, throat, is, so, swollen, that, I, wake, up, at, night, unable, to, breathe., I, actually, had, to, wake, my, girlfriend, up, to, take, me, to, the, ER, yesterday, at, like, 5, am, because, I, started, to, worry, I, was, about, to, go, out, like, Jimi, without, the, sex, drugs, or, rock, &, roll., All, of, these, problems, suddenly, seem, trivial,, though,, as, I, just, heard, Kings, of, Leon's, newest, track,, "Woo, Hoo,", the, b-side, to, their, "Fans", single,, and, I, was, reminded, of, everything, good, in, the, world., Kings, of, Leon-, Woo, Hoo, Now, I, have, a, fever, and, I, don't, feel, like, typing, anymore., Enjoy., at, 8:00, PM, 341, comments, Bands:, Kings, of, Leon, Wednesday,, June, 27,, 2007, The, LCD, Soundsystem, Post, (For, those, of, you, who, think, we're, done,, we're, like,, "no."), A, few, days, ago, I, said, I'd, dedicate, a, whole, new, post, to, LCD, Soundsystem., Well,, the, time, has, come., I, know, there's, not, much, left, to, be, said, about, James, Murphy, or, his, new, album,, Sound, of, Silver,, but, I, would, be, remiss, if, I, neglected, to, create, this, post., Truly, great, albums, don't, come, around, very, often, anymore., We, bounce, from, band, to, band,, album, to, album,, song, to, song, so, quickly, now;, it's, hard, to, stay, interested, in, any, one, thing, for, a, reasonable, amount, of, time., I, hope, you, don't, read, this, and, think, "look, at, this, hypocritical, douchebag.", I, know, that, blogs, like, this, one, fuel, that, approach, to, music,, and, part, of, me, actually, feels, a, bit, of, remorse., Maybe., Anyways..., I, told, you, that, the, two, tracks, at, the, core, of, the, album,, "Someone, Great", and, "All, My, Friends,", were, two, of, my, favorites, of, the, year., I, don't, think, you, will, find, better, back, to, back, tracks, on, any, album, this, year., I'm, having, a, hard, time, thinking, of, any, recent, album, with, back, to, back, tracks, that, good., Maybe, Sonic, Youth's, "Incinerate", and, "Do, You, Believe, in, Rapture,", but, even, then..., Seeing, as, there, really, is, nothing, left, to, say, about, the, album,, I'll, just, try, to, give, you, a, few, b-sides, you, haven't, heard, before., This, first, one,, "Hippie, Priest, Bum, Out,", came, out, as, a, b-side, to, the, "North, American, Scum", single., LCD, Soundsystem-, Hippie, Priest, Bum, Out, The, next, track,, "Freak, Out,", was, a, b-side, to, the, "All, My, Friends", single., LCD, Soundsystem-, Freak, Out, This, last, one, is, special;, it's, a, cover, of, Joy, Division's, "No, Love, Lost", that, came, out, as, a, b-side, to, a, limited, version, of, the, "All, My, Friends", single., Maybe, a, concert-only, version?, I'm, not, really, sure..., Either, way,, check, it, out., LCD, Soundsystem-, No, Love, Lost, I, also, have, a, lot, of, LCD, remixes, that, came, out, as, b-sides, to, this, and, that, if, anyone, is, interested., Not, exactly, my, cup, of, tea,, but, I'll, gladly, throw, them, up, if, enough, of, you, want, them., Enjoy., at, 10:29, AM, 11, comments, Bands:, LCD, Soundsystem, Sunday,, June, 24,, 2007, We've, been, gone, for, a, while,, eh?, We're, still, alive., I, was, starting, to, wonder, about, Trost,, though., Ol'boy, disappeared, on, me, for, a, month, or, so., I, can't, believe, all, of, the, love, you, guys, are, showing, towards, our, humble, little, site., We, really, appreciate, all, the, emails, and, comments., I, know, I've, said, it, before,, but, I, think, we, should, be, back, for, good, this, time., I, don't, really, know, how, to, start, back, up., Maybe, recap, the, big, happenings, of, the, past, month, or, so?, The, new, Spoon, album, is, good., "The, Underdog", really, is, as, fantastic, as, everyone, keeps, saying, it, is., The, new, LCD, Soundsystem, is, my, favorite, album, of, the, year, so, far,, with, "Someone, Great", and, "All, My, Friends", battling, for, favorite, song, of, the, year, honors., I, think, I'll, dedicate, a, whole, post, to, LCD, Soundsystem, within, the, next, few, days., Maybe, try, to, get, you, some, b-sides, or, remixes, you, haven't, heard, or, something., The, new, New, Pornographers, album, has, its, moments,, but, honestly, I, lose, interest, after, the, first, four, tracks., What, else?, Hmmm., I, just, got, the, new, Okkervil, River, album, and, the, new, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah's, EP, today,, so, I'll, have, something, from, those, for, you, pretty, soon., Oh,, and, the, White, Stripes..., I, keep, hearing, Icky, Thump, is, a, good, album,, and, I, have, some, b-sides, from, it..., What, have, we, been, listening, to..., Pay, the, changer, no, mind., I, haven't, listened, to, the, Wilco, or, Voxtrot, albums, for, a, long, time., Both, faded, on, me., Voxtrot, just, put, out, a, weak, album, that, should, have, been, condensed, to, a, fourth, EP,, and, the, Wilco, album, gets, boring, if, you, try, to, listen, to, it, for, more, than, 15, minutes, at, a, time., I, actually, haven't, listened, to, Kings, of, Leon, or, the, Ponys, in, quite, a, while, either., The, only, real, constants, for, me, have, been, Feist, and, LCD, Soundsystem., I've, also, been, listening, to, the, new, Bowerbirds, album, a, bit., Then, there's, always, a, constant, stream, of, new, music:, St., Vincent,, BOAT,, Seymore, Saves, the, World,, Bishop, Allen,, etc., I, don't, even, want, to, tell, you, what, Trost, has, been, listening, to., It'll, just, bring, you, down., Sad, bastard., He, keeps, telling, me, how, good, the, new, Magnolia, Electric, Co., album, is, though,, and, even, though, I've, said, in, the, past, that, I, can, only, listen, to, them, when, I'm, sad,, I, might, have, to, give, it, a, spin, or, two., I, feel, like, I, need, to, reward, you, for, reading, all, that., Here's, a, little, something, from, the, new, Okkervil, River, LP,, The, Stage, Names,, due, out, August, 7th..., Okkervil, River-, Savannah, Smiles, And, even, though, you, all, probably, already, have, these,, they're, pretty, great,, and, I, want, anyone, reading, our, blog, to, have, them..., LCD, Soundsystem-, Someone, Great, Spoon-, The, Underdog, 3, mp3's, isn't, enough..., I, got, the, new, Josh, Rouse, album, the, other, day, (I, was, enticed,, against, my, better, judgement,, by, the, great, album, title, Country, Mouse,, City, House),, and,, as, expected,, I'm, not, really, digging, it., I, really, do, like, the, first, track,, though,, so, here, it, is:, Josh, Rouse-, Sweetie, Guess, that's, all, for, now., Keep, checking, back, this, week., at, 12:12, PM, 18, comments, Bands:, Josh, Rouse,, LCD, Soundsystem,, Okkervil, River,, Spoon, Wednesday,, May, 9,, 2007, Wilco,, Again, The, new, Wilco, b-side, I, posted, up, a, couple, days, ago, got, me, all, excited, about, Wilco, again;, the, past, 48, hours, have, seen, me, searching, through, all, my, favorite, old, tracks, from, Tweedy, &, Co., I, definitely, have, some, favorite, Jeff, Tweedy, moments,, and, I've, been, thinking, about, where, "One, True, Vine", might, fit, in., Ok,, it, might, not, be, quite, that, good, -, Tweedy, has, blessed, us, with, some, seriously, astounding, moments, -, but, it's, still, pretty, wonderful., Anyhow,, here, are, some, of, my, favorite, Tweedy, moments..., I'll, start, off, with, my, absolute, favorite,, Uncle, Tupelo's, "Wait, Up.", This, song, has, been, one, of, my, favorites, since, the, first, time, I, heard, it., I, was, still, just, a, young'in, when, March, 16-20,, 1992, released,, but, I'm, pretty, sure, that,, even, then,, I, would, have, recognized, this, song's, grandeur., Uncle, Tupelo-, Wait, Up, This, next, song, released, 3, years, later, on, Golden, Smog's, 1995, LP, Down, by, the, Old, Mainstream., You, probably, already, know, about, Golden, Smog's, allstar, cast,, but, despite, being, a, veritble, rock, and, roll, "who's, who,", in, my, opinion,, they've, never, really, delivered., Think, a, modern, day, Travelling, Wilburys., This, song,, though,, is, spectacular., Sounds, like, Wilco..., Golden, Smog-, Radio, King, What, else..., There's, just, too, much, to, choose, from., I, guess, I'll, go, with, one, of, my, all, time, favorite, Wilco, songs,, "She's, a, Jar.", That, kind, of, feels, like, cheating, -, you, know,, posting, up, a, track, from, a, Wilco, LP., Instead, I'll, use, the, demo..., Wilco-, She's, a, Jar, (Demo), If, I'm, gonna, post, a, Wilco, song,, I, should, try, to, give, you, something, you, haven't, heard, before,, eh?, Well,, I, have, no, clue, where, this, one, came, from,, and, I, haven't, really, seen, it, floating, around, the, net, anywhere., Don't, believe, me?, Go, search, for, it., I, would, guess, it, released, as, a, b-side, at, some, point,, but, I, really, don't, know, when, or, to, what., Amazing, song,, though., Definitey, a, top, 10, Tweedy, moment., Wilco-, No, More, Poetry, In, 2003, Tweedy, teamed, up, with, Jim, O'Rourk, to, release, Loose, Fur, their, first, album, under, the, moniker, Loose, Fur., Much, like, Golden, Smog,, I, was, very, impressed, with, some, of, it,, and, with, some, of, it, I, was, very, underwhelmed., In, 2006,, though,, they, released, a, sophomore, LP, entitled, Born, Again, in, the, USA,, and, the, last, track, on, that, album, has, definitely, become, one, of, my, favrite, Jeff, Tweedy, moments., Loose, Fur-, Wanted, This, last, song, may, not, be, an, absolute, favorite,, but, it's, still, very, cool., It's, a, live, cover, (that, you, probably, haven't, heard), of, a, great, song, (that, you, probably, have, heard)., Jeff, Tweedy-, I, Shall, Be, Released, (Live, Bob, Dylan, Cover), Ok,, that's, all, for, today., Enjoy., at, 5:47, PM, 9, comments, Bands:, Golden, Smog,, Jeff, Tweedy,, Loose, Fur,, Uncle, Tupelo,, Wilco, Tuesday,, May, 8,, 2007, Wilco-, One, True, Vine, (BRAND, NEW,, YOU, HAVEN'T, HEARD, THIS), I, just, got, my, hands, on, the, first, b-side, from, Wilco's, Sky, Blue, Sky., Wow., You, know, how, I, feel, about, Wilco., This, track, is, no, exception., I, absolutely, LOVE, it., Actually,, after, a, few, listens,, I, might, like, this, more, than, anything, on, the, album,, and, I, love, the, album., Wilco-, One, True, Vine, I, wanna, be, what, you, are, to, me..., Remember, where, you, heard, it, first., Enjoy., at, 1:47, AM, 18, comments, Bands:, Wilco, Sunday,, May, 6,, 2007, DON'T, CALL, THIS, A, COMEBACK, Ok,, this, time, I'm, not, even, going, to, apologize., I'm, just, going, to, start, posting, again., I'll, earn, your, trust, back., Actually,, I, will, apologize, for, not, responding, to, emails., That's, fucked, up, on, my, part., I, really, do, want, to, fill, requests,, but, honestly,, I, get, really,, really, bored, writing, about, old, White, Stripes, b-sides, and, whatnot., On, to, today's, post..., I've, been, thinking, about, covers, a, lot, lately,, probably, stemming, from, reading, that, I, Am, Fuel, post., I, made, a, list, in, my, head, of, recent, indie, covers, that, I've, loved,, and,, I, dunno,, maybe, you'd, like, to, hear, them..., I, can, only, listen, to, Magnolia, Electric, Co., when, I'm, sad., That's, why, I, was, so, surprised, when, I, found, out, that, the, last, track, on, their, 2005, Hard, to, Love, a, Man, EP, was, a, cover, of, Warren, Zevon's, "Werewolves, of, London.", What, a, great, cover;, Molina, &, Co, really, make, it, work..., Magnolia, Electric, Co.-, Werewolves, of, London, Last, year, Regina, Spektor, visited, the, BBC, Radio, studios, and, performed, a, few, songs., Among, them, was, my, favorite, rainy, day, song,, Leonard, Cohen's, "Chelsea, Hotel, #2.", Spektor's, version, of, the, song, is, beautiful., I, don't, mean, to, suggest, that, I, loved, you, the, best..., Regina, Spektor-, Chelsea, Hotel, (Live), Talking, Heads, covers..., I, really, don't, know, how, I, feel, about, them, in, general., I've, heard, some, baaad, ones,, but, I've, also, heard, some, that, I, love..., In, 2003, the, Constantines, released, the, Nighttime, Anytime, EP., It, was, their, first, release, on, Sub, Pop,, setting, the, stage, for, their, prodigious, sophomore, LP,, Shine, A, Light., The, third, track, on, the, four-track, EP, was, a, cover, of, the, Heads', "Thank, You, For, Sending, Me, An, Angel.", This, is, how, a, Talking, Heads, cover, should, sound., Bry, Webb, mimics, Byrne's, voice, a, bit,, but, the, sound, is, still, unmistakably, Constantines..., Constantines-, Thank, You, For, Sending, Me, An, Angel, Another, Talking, Heads, cover, done, right..., Last, year, Voxtrot, played, a, quick, set, for, Seattle, radio, station, KEXP., Along, with, three, tracks, from, their, Mothers,, Sisters,, Daughters, &, Wives, EP, (Mothers,, Sisters,, Daughters, &, Wives,, Rise, Up, In, The, Dirt,, and, Soft, &, Warm),, the, band, played, a, version, of, the, Heads', "Heaven.", I, was, raised, on, Talking, Heads,, and, as, far, back, as, I, can, remember,, "Heaven", has, been, one, of, my, favorite, songs., Imagine, my, excitement,, then,, when, I, discovered, that, it, was, covered, by, my, favorite, new, band., Voxtrot-, Heaven, (Live, on, KEXP), I, guess, I'll, keep, with, the, Voxtrot, theme., I've, been, sitting, here, thinking, about, how, to, present, this, next, track, for, a, few, minutes, now., I, can't, really, paraphrase, the, story, for, you,, so, here, it, is,, straight, from, Ramesh..., "About, a, week, ago, when, we, were, driving, back, to, Texas, for, the, final, two, dates, of, our, tour,, Jared, (keyboardist), received, a, message, from, Garrison, of, Indieinterviews.com,, suggesting, that, Union, City, Blues, would, be, a, nice, song, for, Voxtrot, to, cover., I, mistakenly, believed, Shayla, to, be, called, Union, City, Blues,, and, thus, promised, to, work, up, a, cover, to, record, at, the, venue., There, was, some, confusion, but, after, we, sussed, it, out, I, borrowed, an, accoustic, guitar, from, Bosque, Brown, and, we, headed, to, Garrison's, Corrola, to, record, it., Small, space,, but, his, microphone, was, quite, hi-tech, so, I, think, the, sound, quality, is, actually, okay., I, had, first, heard, this, song, on, a, free, Optimo, New, Year, compilation, and, have, always, been, moved, by, the, liquid, quality, of, her, voice, on, the, recording.", So, there, you, have, it., Ramesh, Srivastava-, Shayla, I, think, that's, a, good, place, to, transition, to, Jose, Gonzalez,, yes?, Of, course, I, can't, have, a, covers, post, and, talk, about, Jose, Gonzalez, without, mentioning, his, take, on, the, Knife's, "Heartbeats.", When, "Heartbeats", released, as, a, single,, the, b-side, was,, well,, a, live, version, of, the, track, (That, seems, like, cheating, to, me,, but, whatever)., Jose, Gonzalez-, Heartbeats, (Live), That's, not, what, I, wanted, to, talk, about,, though., In, 2005, Gonzalez, released, a, pretty, limited, Australian, Tour, EP., The, first, track, on, the, EP, is, a, cover, of, Joy, Division's, infamous, "Love, Will, Tear, Us, Apart.", I, know, I, probably, don't, need, to, give, you, the, backstory,, but, Joy, Division, recorded, this, song, pretty, much, right, before, Ian, Curtis, committed, suicide., What, a, sad,, sad, song., Jose, Gonzalez-, Love, Will, Tear, Us, Apart, In, 2005, Calexico, and, Iron, &, Wine, got, together, to, record, their, In, The, Reins, EP., As, good, as, that, EP, was,, I, think, my, favorite, part, of, their, partnership, was, revealed, at, their, live, shows,, where, they, frequently, played, a, fantastic, cover, of, the, Rolling, Stones', "Wild, Horses.", Something, about, that, song, has, always, just, killed, me;, it's, definitely, one, of, my, favorite, Stones, songs,, and, these, guys, do, it, justice., This, recording, is, from, October, 22,, 2005,, at, the, Triple, Door, in, Seattle., Iron, and, Wine, with, Calexico-, Wild, Horses, (Live), You, may, remember, a, post, I, made, a, month, or, two, ago, about, Beirut, in, which, I, included, a, Calexico, cover, of, the, Clash's, "Guns, of, Brixton.", I'll, go, ahead, and, post, it, again, here., It's, definitely, the, best, cover, of, the, song, that, I've, ever, heard., Calexico-, The, Guns, of, Brixton, While, I'm, posting, a, couple, Calexico, tracks, I, might, as, well, give, you, their, take, on, the, Minutemen's, "Corona,", eh?, In, 2004, Calexico, released, their, Convict, Pool, EP., Among, the, six, tracks, on, the, EP, is, a, cover, of, "Corona,", complete, with, mariachi, band., It's, such, a, great, song, to, begin, with,, and, I, love, their, take, on, it., Calexico-, Corona, I'll, round, out, this, post, with, the, song, that, inspired, it:, Britt, Daniel's, take, on, Sam, Cooke's, immortal, "Bring, It, On, Home, To, Me.", This, track, just, came, out, on, Bridging, the, Distance,, a, compilation, of, covers, from, Portland, area, bands., I, would, suggest, that, everyone, go, to, the, site, and, BUY, IT..., I, mean,, come, on,, it's, only, $10., I, honestly, wish, I, could, post, just, about, every, track, from, the, compilation., Britt, Daniel-, Bring, It, On, Home, To, Me, Alright,, that's, all, for, today., Enjoy.,

April, 30,, 2007, slow, dancing, barefoot, on, a, dusty, front, porch, somewhere, I, was, looking, through, a, few, blogs, the, other, day, -, you, know,, sizing, up, the, competition, -, when, I, came, across, I, AM, FUEL,, YOU, ARE, FRIENDS., Normally, I, don't, get, too, excited, over, anything, I, see, on, other, blogs,, but, her, Sam, Cooke, post, caught, my, eye., You, probably, could, have, guessed, by, the, name, of, the, site, (I, was, boooooooorn, by, the, river...), that, I, am, a, huge, Sam, Cooke, fan., In, addition, to, posting, over, 500*, covers, of, one, of, the, greatest, songs, of, all, time,, she, wrote, something, so, perfect, that, I, can't, get, it, out, of, my, head:, ...it, always, sounds, to, me, like, slow, dancing, barefoot, on, a, dusty, front, porch, somewhere., Try, listening, to, the, original, version, of, "Bring, It, On, Home, To, Me", without, thinking, about, that, line, now., I, dare, you., *Rough, estimate..., I, stopped, counting,

Architecture, in, Helsinki, fan,, but, there's, something, about, this, song, that, I, really, like., I, dunno,, check, it, out, for, yourself., Like, I, said,, I've, never, been, a, huge, fan,, so, I, don't, have, a, ton, of, rare, tracks, or, anything., I, have, a, few, that, you, might, not, have, heard., We'll, see..., This, next, track, has, appeared, on, a, few, limited, EP's,, the, first, of, which, (I'm, fairly, certain), being, 2002's, Like, a, Call, EP., Architecture, in, Helsinki-, Sooner, than, Soon, I, like, this, track, a, lot, too., I, dunno,, maybe, I'm, coming, around;, starting, to, see, the, light..., I, was, also, going, to, post, up, a, live, version, of, "It's, 5!", from, the, Architecture, in, Helsinki/Takka, Takka/Clap, Your, Hands, Say, Yeah, 2006, tour, EP,, but, I, just, realized, I, already, posted, that, a, long, time, ago., Oh, well,, here, it, is, again..., Architecture, in, Helsinki-, It's, 5!, (Live), Enjoy., at, 2:19, PM, 6, comments, Bands:,

Series., The, a-side, is, "Flesh,", a, previously, unreleased, track, that, predates, Islands', 2006, debut, album, Return, to, the, Sea., I've, heard, that, "Flesh", was, actually, the, first, track, the, band, ever, recorded,, and, the, Unicorns, even, played, it, at, their, final, shows., The, b-side, is, a, brand, new, track, (!), called, "Dnttakemy, Wingzz, Away.", I've, liked, "Flesh", since, the, first, time, I, heard, it,, but, "Dnttakemy, Wingzz, Away", definitely, took, a, few, listens, to, grow, on, me., I, like, both, tracks, quite, a, bit,, though., Islands-, Flesh, Islands-,
