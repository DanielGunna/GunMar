world, the, same?, 27., If, the, different, standards, aren't, compatible, with, each, other,, how, do, you, trade, with, collectors, overseas?, 28., What, do, I, do, now?, LEGALITIES, CONCERNING, TAPE, TRADING, I, have, put, this, here, first, because, so, many, people, are, confused, about, this, issue., Here, are, some, FACTS., top, of, page, 1., What, is, the, Sony/Betamax, Decision?, The, Sony/Betamax, decision, was, decided, on, January, 17,, 1984, by, the, supreme, court., It, states:, "Sale, of, home, videotape, recorded, held, not, to, constitute, contributory, infringement, of, television, program, copyrights., It, was, held, that, the, sale, of, home, video, tape, recorders, to, the, general, public, did, not, constitute, contributory, infringement, of, copyrights, on, television, programs, since, there, was, a, significant, likelihood, that, substantial, numbers, of, copyright, holders, who, license, their, works, for, broadcast, on, free, [or, cable], television, would, not, object, to, having, their, broadcasts, time-shifted, by, private, viewers, and, the, plaintiff, copyright, holders, did, not, demonstrate, time-shifting, would, cause, any, likelihood, of, non-minimal, harm, to, the, potential, market, for,, or, the, value, of,, copyrighted, works.", (Guide, to, American, Law,, volume, 3,, 1983, p, 46-7), All, this, means, is, it, is, LEGAL, to, tape, television, programs, off, the, air, and, that, no, legal, prosecution, can, happen, to, manufacturers, of, video, cassette, recorders, and, blank, tape, as, well, as, the, "Home, Use", consumer., top, of, page, 2., What, is, the, "Fair, Use", exception?, An, article, in, Newsweek, (January, 30,, 1984, p57-8), explains, it:, Justice, Paul, Stevens, wrote, that, home, taping, falls, within, the, traditional, "Fair, Use", Exception, of, copyright, restrictions., Studies,, he, said,, demonstrated, that, most, taping, was, done, for, "Time-Shifting", recording, a, program, for, viewing, at, a, more, convenient, time., Such, taping,, he, argued,, has, "no, demonstrable, effect, upon, the, value, of, copyrighted, work.", However,, he, drew, the, line, at, selling, home, made, tapes., "If, the, Betamax, were, used, to, make, copies, for, a, commercial, or, profit, making, purpose,", declared, Stevens,, "Such, use, would, be, presumptively, unfair"., This, states, that, time-shifting, is, "Fair, Use", only, if, the, tapes, are, for, personal, use, and, not, to, make, a, profit., top, of, page, 3., What, does, the, law, say, about, copying, tapes?, The, U.S., Code,, TITLE, 17,, article, 506, states:, "Any, person, who, infringes, a, copyright, willfully, and, for, purposes, of, COMMERCIAL, advantage, or, private, FINANCIAL, gain, shall, be, punished, as, proven, in, section, 2319, of, title, 18.", This, means, again,, a, violation, is, made, when, a, profit, or, commercial, gain, is, made., Some, copyright, lawyers, may, consider, tape, trading, a, commercial, advantage., top, of, page, 4., Will, the, FBI, get, involved, in, tape, trading?, In, a, phone, interview, (conducted, 10/31/94), with, officer, David, Grossman,, Copyright, Squad, of, the, Chicago, FBI, states, "copying, videotapes, is, a, violation, only, if, commercial, gain, is, made., We, are, only, involved, with, major, copyright, infringement, cases,, people, manufacturing, and, selling, thousands, of, tapes., We, don't, get, involved, in, the, mon-and-pop,, one, or, two, tapes, being, copied., Video, trading, for, non-profit, is, not, a, concern, of, ours,, it's, not, major, enough, for, us, to, get, involved.", He, did, also, state, that, there, was, something, that, said, that, only, 7, or, less, copies, could, be, made, in, a, period, of, 180, days,, but, wasn't, sure, if, that, applies, to, tape, trading, or, not., This, states, that, the, FBI, is, not, concerned, with, non-profit, tape, trading, but, are, when, thousands, of, copies, are, being, made, and, sold., But, this, wouldn't, necessarily, prevent, them, from, making, examples, to, discourage, others., top, of, page, 5., Is, non-profit,, private, tape, trading, illegal?, Well, we, do, know, non-profit, tape, collecting, is, in, fact, LEGAL, (as, stated, with, the, Sony, Decision), but, there, is, nothing, that, says, non-profit, tape, trading, is, illegal., Research, shows, that, there, has, never, been, a, supreme, court, decision, concerning, non-profit, tape, trading,, and, there, are, no, specific, laws, against, it., This, may, change, if, this, type, of, case, makes, it, to, the, Supreme, Court, without, being, thrown, out, beforehand., Also, are, the, copyright, holders, willing, to, go, that, far?, Probably, not,, it, would, cost, a, lot, of, time, and, money, for, something, that, doesn't, affect, them, that, much., Many, copyright, lawyers, would, consider, tape, trading, a, copyright, infringement,, but, this, again, would, have, to, be, debated, in, the, courts, (if, it, went, that, far)., The, FBI, does, have, the, power, to, make, examples, to, discourage, others,, but, to, my, knowledge, this, has, yet, to, happen, (I, may, be, wrong, though), Well, that, argument, may, go, on, forever,, but, at, least, we, know, some, legal, FACTS., TAPE, TRADING, top, of, page, 6., What, is, Tape, Trading?, Tape, trading, is, the, practice, of, trading, home, recorded, video, or, audio, tapes, of, material, with, other, collectors, on, a, non-profit, basis., Each, person, will, record, material, the, other, person, requests,, and, then, the, tapes, are, "Swapped.", Generally,, tapes, are, swapped, tape-for-tape, or, on, an, equal, time, basis., top, of, page, 7., What, are, "trade, lists"?, Trade, lists, or, "lists", are, listings, of, what, items, a, collector, has, in, their, collection., Lists, generally, include, title, of, show,, episode, titles, time, and, quality, rating, (based, on, quality, of, the, picture, and, audio, and, not, overall, quality, of, the, show, or, performance), for, television, or, name, of, band,, venue,, date,, running, time, and, quality, for, music., Each, collector, "Swaps", lists,, picks, items, from, each, others, lists, (equal, time, on, each), and, swap, tapes., top, of, page, 8., What, is, off-air, recording, and, trading?, Off-air, recording, is, recording, television, programs, directly, from, broadcast, channels., Off-air, trading, is, done, by, collectors, exchanging, tv, schedules, in, different, geographic, areas., Each, trader, picks, programs, for, the, other, to, record, that, are, not, being, played, in, their, area., top, of, page, 9., What, is, a, "Dub"?, A, dub, is, a, copy, of, a, tape., top, of, page, 10., What, is, meant, by, "generation", in, video?, A, generation, is, the, number, of, copies, away, from, the, original, signal., From, the, off-air, tape, you, make, a, copy,, and, copy, that, copy, --, you, will, have, 3rd, generation., top, of, page, 11., What, is, "Time, shifting"?, Time, shifting, is, setting, your, VCR's, timer, to, record, a, program, and, watching, it, at, a, later, time, or, even, making, a, dub, of, the, program, while, cutting, out, commercials., top, of, page, 12., What, is, Drop-out?, Dropout, is, a, loss, of, picture, signal, during, tape, playback, or, record., It, displays, a, black, &, white, streak, across, the, picture,, making, the, audio, and, video, "garbled"., top, of, page, 13., How, is, video, quality, rated?, Everyone, has, their, own, way, of, rating, the, picture, and, sound, quality, of, video., Some, people, use, numbers,, others, use, the, "school", method, of, A-F,, but, most, people, use, the, following, guidelines:, E, =, Excellent, -, Either, pre-recorded, tape, (recorded, at, SP, speed), or, recorded, directly, off-air., VG, =, Very, Good, -, 1st, or, second, generation, dub,, or, off-air, recording, recorded, at, SLP, or, with, weak, antennae, or, cable, signal., Generation, lines, appear, &, create, a, fuzzy, picture., Minimal, dropouts., G, =, Good, -, 3, generations, or, more., Heavy, generation, lines., Very, fuzzy, picture, and, quite, a, few, dropouts., P, =, Poor, -, Unbearable, picture, &, sound, quality., Heavy, dropouts, or, even, "undupable.", Usually, used, only, for, diehards, who, can't, find, the, item, anywhere, else., I, use, a, 2-5, numerical, system,, in, which, 5, equals, Excellent, and, 2, equals, Poor., --JF, This, by, far, is, NOT, the, only, guideline, everyone, uses,, it's, only, of, an, example, using, my, quality, rating, scale, that, I, go, by., top, of, page, 14., What, do, people, generally, collect, on, video?, The, most, common, classifications, are, Movies,, Television,, Music, and, anime., Movie, collecting, can, range, from, the, very, common, to, the, very, rare., For, example, there, are, some, pretty, rare, B-movies, several, collectors, are, looking, for., Television, can, get, a, little, more, difficult., Many, collectors, collect, shows, that, appeal, to, their, interests, (sci-fi,, westerns,, sitcoms), or, classic, shows, they, grew, up, with, which, can, get, a, little, more, difficult., Other, collectors, look, for, material, on, certain, actors, or, actresses., Or, there, are, people, like, myself, who,, for, some, unknown, reason,, just, like, to, collect, classic, TV, shows., Music, video, is, much, more, specified., A, collector, will, collect, a, certain, artist, or, group, much, like, a, record, collector, would, collect, records., Music, video, can, range, from, MTV, "single, song", videos, or, "Promos", as, we, call, them,, TV, concerts, or, "Private, shot", or, "single, camera", shows., These, are, concerts, that, are, video, taped, using, camcorders, snuck, into, the, concert, venue, and, then, videotaped., These, shows, are, usually, very, shaky, with, bad, audio, quality., Japanese, animation, or, "Anime", is, animation, from, Japan, that, has, become, EXTREMELY, popular, in, recent, years., The, animation, is, very, strong,, and, well, done., Most, animation, is, science, fiction, or, action, television, shows, and, movies., For, more, information, see, the, Japanese, Animation, FAQ, or, E-mail, David, Boeren, at, akemi@netcom.com, for, a, copy., top, of, page, 15., What, are, some, other, things, people, collect, on, video?, ANYTHING, AND, EVERYTHING!, The, most, common, collectors, collect, movies,, television, shows, and, music, video., Each, category, can, get, more, specific, (science, fiction,, westerns,, comedy,, drama,, specific, actors, or, music, groups)., In, my, experience, I, have, run, across, people, who, collect, some, of, the, most, interesting, things, such, as, footage, of, people, getting, pies-in-the-face,, beach, scenes,, explosions,, training, films, or, anything, on, Charles, Manson!, top, of, page, 16., What, does, "w/o/c", mean?, With, Original, Commercials., What, this, means, is, the, television, episode, includes, the, original, network, commercials, when, the, show, originally, aired., This, can, be, really, cool, because, many, shows, in, the, 50's, and, 60's, included, the, commercial, in, the, actual, show, or, used, actual, characters, from, the, show, to, present, the, product, (a, classic, example, of, this, is, the, Beverly, Hillbillies, pilot, or, any, of, the, Rocky, &, Bullwinkle, shows, w/o/c), top, of, page, 17., What, is, the, best, way, of, sending, tapes, to, other, collectors?, Well, the, most, obvious, way, is, through, the, U.S., Mail, (snail, mail), however, some, choose, to, send, UPS, or, even, Federal, Express, (though, very, costly), It, is, best, to, both, agree, on, a, class, to, ship, when, setting, up, a, trade., Some, collectors, may, want, a, more, expensive, class,, if, so, they, would, pay, for, the, difference., Most, of, the, trades, I, do,, we, both, agree, on, first, class., As, of, January, 1,, 1994, first, class, shipping, in, the, U.S., is:, 2-3, tapes, $3.00, 4-5, tapes, $4.00, 6-7, tapes, (Need, current, rates, on, these), First, class, is, equivalent, to, Priority, Mail, in, the, U.S., In, general,, 6-7, tapes, will, cost, $6.00, --JF, For, now, foreign, postage, rates, remained, unchanged, This, cost, varies, quite, a, bit., Sending, to, Italy,, Greece,, and, the, Middle, East, is, very, expensive, (recently,, I, sent, 7, tapes, and, a, 2, lb., book, Air, Mail, for, $38.00, and, change)., Some, countries,, such, as, Great, Britain,, allow, a, less, expensive, "small, packet", rate., Your, package, must, be, small, in, size, and, weight, (I, don't, have, the, exact, specifications)., --JF, top, of, page, 18., How, do, I, get, more, information, about, starting, up, tape, collecting, and, trading?, Simple!, Check, out, the, "Beginner's, guide, to, tape, collecting, and, trading.", Maintained, by, your's, truly,, it, can, be, found, on, the, alt.video.tape-trading, newsgroup, on, the, 1st, of, every, month., top, of, page, 19., Where, can, I, find, other, collectors?, There, are, many, Internet, newsgroups,, publications, and, services, out, there, that, deal, with, video, collecting, and, trading., USENET, NEWSGROUPS, alt.video.tape-trading, This, newsgroup, deals, exclusively, with, non-profit, video, collecting, and, trading., If, you, are, on, the, Internet,, this, is, the, place, to, go!, Posting, a, message, is, simple,, just, compose, your, subject, line, like:, WANTED:, <the, show, you, are, looking, for>, or, HAVE:, <the, show, you, have, for, trade>, In, the, body, of, the, message, include, details, of, the, show, and, what, you, are, looking, for,, then, respond, via, e-mail., For, best, results, always, state, things, you, have, to, offer, in, return, for, trade,, this, always, wets, people's, appetites, to, do, a, trade, if, you, have, something, they, are, looking, for., Other, good, groups, to, check, out, are:, rec.arts.tv, -, television, shows, in,

and, movies, rec.arts.anime, -, Japanese, animation, alt.cult-movies, -, From, Psychotronic, films, to, Reservoir, Dogs, PUBLICATIONS, This, section, was, woefully, out, of, date., Dark, Waters, will, publish, an, updated, listing, in, the, future., --JF, SERVICES, THE, TV, CONNECTION, (voice, mail, service), c/o, Shokus, Video, P.O., Box, 3125, Chatsworth,, CA, 91313, Subscription:, $10, per, month, +, Long, distance, if, outside, California, $50, for, 6, months, +, LD, (monthly, fees, are, automatically, cut, in, 1/2, after, 1st, 6, months), (a, free, subscription, to, Airwaves, newsletter, is, included), Sample:, for, free,, no, obligation, demo, call, (818)709-8813, &, Press, 1, If, you, have, a, phone, and, don't, have, this, service, GET, IT!!!!, This, is, by, far, the, BEST, way, to, contact, other, collectors, for, ANY, TV, series!, It, works, a, lot, like, the, Internet:, You, have, a, voice, mail, box,, and, there, are, 2, boards-, the, want, board, (what, collectors, are, looking, for), and, the, barter, board, (what, collectors, have), each, board, have, categories, (sci-fi,, comedy,, animation,, drama,, game, shows,, music, video,, TV, memorabilia,, etc.), the, collectors, say, what, they, have, or, want, and, give, their, voice, mail, box, number., You, can, then, access, their, voice, mail, box, and, leave, a, message, (your, voice, mail, box, number, or, even, your, address, and, phone, number, if, you, wish), You, can, also, post, on, the, boards, what, you, have, and, are, looking, for, as, well., This, is, by, far, the, most, immediate, and, personal, way, to, find, video, and, come, in, contact, with, other, collectors., They, also, offer, a, video, newsletter, featuring, reviews, and, features, on, video, collecting, and, exclusive, interviews., As, this, FAQ, was, written, nearly, two, years, ago,, I, wonder, if, this, service, still, exists., --JF, top, of, page, 20., What, is, an, episode, guide, and, why, are, they, useful?, An, episode, guide, is, a, listing, of, the, titles, of, episodes, within, a, series., A, guide, can, also, list, important, information, such, as, production, number,, guest, stars,, writers,, directors,, descriptions, of, the, episodes, and, original, air, dates., These, help, quite, a, but, for, collecting, as, a, "Checklist", for, episodes, you, have, in, your, collection, so, you, can, see, how, many, you, still, need., Or, they, are, great, for, locating, a, certain, episode, if, you, know, what, the, episode, is, about, and, not, the, title., top, of, page, 21., Where, can, I, get, an, episode, guide, to, <name, of, show>, Simple., The, Tardis, TV, archive!, This, is, an, EXCELLENT, place, to, find, episode, guides, to, TV, shows, or, other, TV, related, files., The, official, archive, to, the, alt.video.tape-trading, archive, is, here, as, well., It, can, be, reached, at, either, anonymous, FTP, or, by, WWW., The, addresses, are:, http://src.doc.ic.ac.uk/public/media/tv/collections/tardis, ftp://src.doc.ic.ac.uk/public/media/tv/collections/tardis, top, of, page, 22., Is, it, true, that, Superstation, WGN, Channel, 9, in, Chicago's, programming, is, different, on, the, cable, feed, than, if, you, received, it, locally?, Yep., WGN, shows, many, programs, that, other, stations, in, different, areas, show, locally, (Montel, Williams,, Hard, Copy,, etc.), If, you, are, outside, Illinois., Just, try, to, look, up, Star, Trek, Deep, Space, Nine, Sunday, Nights, at, 8:00, and, you'll, see, what, I, mean., So, WGN, substitutes, replacement, programming, during, certain, times, over, their, national, cable, feed., Unfortunately, for, us, they, have, been, showing, some, really, GREAT, stuff, in, the, past, such, as, "Captain, Nice","My, World, and, Welcome, to, It", and, most, recently, "Quincy.", Fortunately, for, collectors, outside, the, Illinois, area,, WGN, can, serve, as, an, EXCELLENT, source, for, off-air, trades!!, The, same, can, be, said, for, most, nationally, broadcast, cable, stations., --JF, top, of, page, TECHNICAL, STUFF, 23., What, types, of, video, tape, formats, do, collectors, usually, use?, The, most, common, tape, format, used, now, is, standard, VHS., Many, collectors, are, now, upgrading, to, Super, VHS., 8mm, and, Hi-8, are, also, becoming, popular, format, among, collectors., Beta, has, declined, among, the, general, public, but, many, collectors, still, prefer, Super, Beta, for, the, better, picture, quality., 3/4", tape,, once, the, standard, for, television, has, long, since, disappeared, from, the, "professional, and, broadcast", world., 3/4", U-matic, decks, can, now, be, picked, up, for, as, little, as, $10, and, many, used, tapes, are, sold, VERY, cheap, or, even, given, away., Many, collectors, are, picking, up, 3/4", as, an, inexpensive, alternative, to, S, VHS, (but, not, quite, as, good, a, quality, as, S, VHS), 1", and, Betacam, SP, "broadcast, quality", formats, aren't, generally, used, by, collectors,, but, I, have, run, across, some, collectors, who, have, items, in, these, formats., top, of, page, 24., Is, there, a, difference, between, audio, recorded, in, mono, or, Hi-Fi, even, if, the, master, audio, is, mono?, YES,, there, is, quite, a, difference., Hi-Fi, is, a, stereo, audio, signal, embedded, across, the, entire, tape, deeper, than, the, video, signal., Seeing, it, uses, the, whole, width, of, the, tape, (apart, from, the, small, tracks, mono, or, linear, stereo, uses)., This, allows, a, wider, range, of, audio, frequencies, to, be, recorded., Hi-Fi, also, reduces, hiss, commonly, found, in, mono, or, linear, stereo, tracks., top, of, page, 25., What, are, the, best, brands, of, tapes, to, use?, Another, well, argued, question., Again,, each, trader, has, their, own, preference., Whatever, tape, you, decide, to, use, be, sure, it, is, VHS, certified., You, can, tell, this, if, it, has, the, [VHS], logo, on, cover, (this, is, the, same, logo, that's, on, your, VCR.), That, means, this, tape, was, approved, by, JVC, (who, invented, VHS), some, tapes, just, have, VHS, in, regular, letters, (NOT, in, the, proper, logo, font), AVOID, THEM!, I, have, decided, to, review, the, different, brands, I, have, used, and, the, results, I, have, experienced., NORMAL, GRADE, TDK, HS, My, personal, favorite, regular, grade, blank., The, picture, and, sound, quality, are, really, good,, even, in, SLP, recording., Panasonic, has, just, come, out, with, the, STD, which, in, my, experience, is, not, as, good, as, HS., MAXELL, EX, My, same, feelings, as, the, TDK, normal, grade., In, the, past, they, started, bulk, loading, cheap, tape, from, Korea, into, their, shells, and, charging, the, same, price, as, they, were, before, (when, they, were, using, the, better, quality, tape), As, I, understand, it, now,, they, stopped, doing, it, but, check, the, "Made, In...", label, on, the, back, of, the, package, to, be, sure., SCOTCH, HS, With, my, experience,, for, audio, and, video, scotch, tape, is, ALRIGHT, and, nothing, more., They, have, a, few, dropouts,, but, the, biggest, problem, I, have, has, is, the, leader, snaps, of, the, spool, sometimes, when, I, rewind, the, tape., As, you, can, imagine, a, MAJOR, pain, in, the, a**!, FUJI, HQ, A, good, tape,, not, as, good, as, Maxell, or, Scotch, but, a, good, tape., KODAK, HS, For, a, tape, coming, from, a, leader, in, photography, and, picture, quality, I, would, expect, more, from, them!, I've, never, been, happy, with, the, picture, quality, of, Kodak., POLAROID, (regular, grade), I, think, less, of, Polaroid, than, I, do, Kodak., They, started, using, REALLY, cheap, tape, stock, recently., RCA, (regular, grade), Crap,, I've, never, seen, a, good, picture, from, RCA, (like, Kodak,, I'd, expect, more, from, them), Dropout, is, horrible., An, RCA, almost, trashed, a, deck, of, mine, last, year,, so, I, don't, think, too, highly, of, them., JVC, (regular, grade), To, tell, you, the, truth,, I've, never, tried, their, normal, grade., GEMINI, (regular, grade), To, put, it, this, way,, I'D, NEVER, let, anything, like, that, go, in, my, VCR., TARGET, (regular, grade), Target, is, owned, by, 3M, who, makes, Scotch,, but, I, don't, think, they, use, the, same, tape., A, good, brand, to, try, is, the, BASF, T-130., If, you, convert, from, NTSC, to, PAL, using, a, T-120,, you, may, find, that, you, run, out, of, tape, before, the, second, movie, is, finished., With, the, T-130,, you, can, comfortably, fit, two, 90-minute, feature, films, on, a, single, tape,, recorded, in, PAL, format., The, BASF, T-130, is, getting, harder, to, find, these, days,, but, worth, it., The, quality, seems, pretty, good., --JF, HIGH, GRADES, TDK, E-HG, My, personal, fave, of, all, brands, and, grades!, To, date, I, have, had, no, problems, with, these,, I'm, VERY, happy, with, the, sound, and, picture, quality., My, only, gripe, is, TDK, likes, changing, their, labels, about, every, 6, months!, MAXELL, HGX-GOLD, My, second, choice, only, because, I, get, TDK, cheaper., But, their, free, stuff, "Frequent, Buyer", Max, points, are, an, extra, incentive, if, they, are, the, same, price, as, TDK., SUPER, VHS, MAXELL, XR-S, I, haven't, been, to, happy, with, this, one, in, the, past., The, picture, quality, is, not, great, and, I, have, experienced, several, dropouts., JVC, XG, I've, been, quite, happy, with, this, one!, The, picture, quality, is, Excellent, and, I've, experienced, no, dropouts., (price, on, this, one, is, generally, cheaper, than, the, Maxell), top, of, page, 26., Are, the, television, systems, around, the, world, the, same?, NO,, actually, they, are, quite, different., There, are, 3, different, systems, around, the, world,, one, is, not, compatible, with, the, other, and, must, be, converted., The, first, is, NTSC, (National, Television, Standards, Committee)., It, is, 525, horizontal, scan, lines, to, make, a, complete, image, every, 30th, of, a, second., This, format, is, used, in, the, United, States,, Canada, and, Japan., NTSC, records, 120, minutes, per, standard, length, tape., The, second, standard, is, called, PAL, (Phase, Alternate, Line), It, uses, 625, lines, at, a, 25th, of, a, second., PAL, is, used, in, England,, Germany,, The, Netherlands, Spain,, Italy, and, Australia., There, are, two, PAL, variations,, N-PAL, used, in, Paraguay, and, M-PAL, used, in, Brazil., PAL, is, recorded, at, a, much, slower, speed, so, it, records, 180, minutes, per, standard, length, tape., The, third, standard, in, SECAM, (sequential, color, by, memory)., It, also, uses, 625, lines, at, a, 25th, of, a, second., SECAM, is, used, in, France,, Greece, and, Russia., A, variation, called, MESECAM, is, used, in, Africa., Like, PAL,, SECAM, records, at, 180, minutes, per, tape., top, of, page, 27., If, the, different, standards, aren't, compatible, with, each, other,, how, do, you, trade, with, collectors, overseas?, Ask, that, question, five, years, ago, and, the, answer, was, not, practically, (or, at, least, affordably), Conversion, equipment, was, downright, unafordable, for, the, consumer, or, collector, and, getting, it, converted, from, a, studio, would, cost, at, least, $75, an, hour!, There, was, also, "optical, transfers", where, you, would, take, a, PAL, VCR, and, monitor, and, focus, an, NTSC, camcorder, at, the, screen, and, shoot, the, video, off, screen., This, led, to, very, poor, video, quality, as, well, as, unbalanced, color, or, even, no, color, at, all., Lately, a, great, deal, of, VCR's, over, in, Europe, have, NTSC, playback, capability., It, speeds, up, the, tape, playback, to, NTSC, speed, as, well, as, converting, the, color, to, PAL, encoding,, the, timebase, in, the, TV, adjusts, automatically., Now, there, are, a, variety, of, VCRs, that, convert, from, one, system, to, another., Here's, an, overview, of, some, of, them:, PANASONIC, AGW-1, What, can, I, say,, this, is, the, best, item, I, have, EVER, bought!!!!, Panasonic, really, put, some, effort, into, coming, out, with, a, GREAT, deck!!!, It, has, a, built, in, VCR, or, can, be, used, alone, as, just, a, converter, between, 2, decks., You, can, record, or, play, in, ANY, system., For, example, you, can, play, a, tape, in, PAL, in, the, AGW-1,, it, will, convert, it, to, NTSC, and, you, record, it, on, an, external, NTSC, deck., Or, you, can, play, an, NTSC, tape, on, your, external, NTSC, deck, and, record, it, in, the, AGW-1, in, PAL, (converting, it, internally)., I, have, only, 2, gripes, about, this, deck., First, there, is, no, tuner,, so, to, record, off-air, would, require, to, record, it, on, another, deck, and, convert, it, (bringing, it, down, another, generation)., Second, there, is, no, RF, output., Even, though, it, is, a, professional, deck, it, would, be, nice, to, have., If, you, are, into, foreign, video,, BUY, THIS, DECK!!, It's, a, bit, pricey, (about, $2000.00), but, WELL, worth, it, in, the, long, run!, The, price, has, gone, up,, closer, to, $2,500., Don't, believe, any, vendor, who, claims, they, can, get, you, an, AGW-1, for, $1,500., --JF, SHARP, VC-WD1, From, what, I, hear, this, is, a, deck, that, is, comparable, to, the, AGW-1, that, Panasonic, has, out., This, deck, features, the, same, conversion, method, Panasonic, uses, and, the, quality, is, the, same, (if, not, better, according, to, some, owners), but, also, has, more, features, that, the, Panasonic, doesn't, have., First, of, all, the, price, is, a, bit, lower, (pricing, at, about, $1550), The, Panasonic, is, mostly, low, end, professional, equipment,, the, sharp, is, more, of, a, consumer, model., This, unit, features, a, timer, and, a, tuner, that, can, take, a, broadcast, signal, and, convert, it, to, any, of, it's, featured, standards, (NTSC,, PAL, and, MESECAM), The, back, also, features, EUROPEAN, "F", connectors, that, can, make, cable, hookup, a, bit, tricky., This, unit, has, more, extra, features, than, the, AGW-1, by, a, long, shot., Featuring, remote, control, free, speed, shuttle,, digital, picture-in-picture,, digital, picture, freeze,, strobe, effects, and, index, search, just, to, name, a, few., Unfortunately, this, deck, can, only, convert, NTSC,, PAL, and, MESECAM, (leaving, out, SECAM-L, and, PAL-M), regular, SECAM, only, has, black, and, white, output., Compared, to, the, AGW-1, this, deck, is, LESS, user, friendly., The, back, features, EUROPEAN, "F", connectors, that, can, make, cable, hookup, a, bit, tricky,, as, well, as, a, European, power, cord., (you, can, purchase, European, power, adaptors, from, your, local, Radio, Shack), The, tuner, only, tunes, up, to, channel, 37, which, may, be, a, bit, of, a, problem, with, U.S., cable, systems., This, unit, can't, play, back, Quasi-S, VHS, like, the, AGW-1, can, (playing, S, VHS, tapes, with, normal, output)., The, biggest, draw, back, of, this, item, is, the, VC-WD1, is, a, "Gray, Market", item, in, this, country, (not, meeting, certain, safety, regulations), so, it, doesn't, have, a, warranty., This, is, a, good, deck, if, you, just, can't, afford, the, AGW-1, but, can, beg,, borrow, and, steal, for, this, one., AIWA, (need, model, #), I, haven't, seen, this, deck, yet, but, from, what, I, heard, it's, not, great., First, of, all, it, only, has, an, output, (no, input), so, transferring, a, PAL, to, NTSC, tape, is, easy,, but, to, transfer, NTSC, to, PAL,, you, need, an, additional, PAL, deck, to, record, it, on., I, also, heard, the, NTSC, to, PAL, conversion, looks, like, the, picture, is, shrunk, (extra, scan, lines, are, not, compensated)., This, deck, is, much, cheaper, (about, $500.00), but, not, worth, the, price., I, evaluated, this, product, in, 1995., It, is, okay, if, you, just, want, to, view, PAL, tapes, on, an, NTSC, TV, monitor., The, serious, conversion, hobbyist, will, not, want, to, bother, with, it., --JF, INSTANT, REPLAY, 50/60, HZ, DIGITAL, FRAME, CONVERTER, From, what, I, hear, this, machine, is, CRAP!, The, PAL, to, NTSC, conversion, is, very, bad, quality, just, for, viewing, (it's, even, worse, when, you, record, it), The, deck, does, come, with, a, tuner, and, RF, output, but, that's, no, real, consolation, because, the, converter, is, so, bad., This, deck, is, about, the, same, price, as, the, Aiwa,, so, if, you, simply, can't, afford, the, AGW-1,, go, for, the, Aiwa., This, information, is, inaccurate., Instant, Replay, makes, conversion, decks, to, order,, and, they, can, run, anywhere, from, $3,000, to, over, $10,000,, depending, on, the, features, you, want., --JF,
