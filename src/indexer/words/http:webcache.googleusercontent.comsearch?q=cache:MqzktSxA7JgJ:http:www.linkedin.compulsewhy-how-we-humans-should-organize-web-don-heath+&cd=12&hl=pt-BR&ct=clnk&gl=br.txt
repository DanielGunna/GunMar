follow, this, author, Assistant, Professor, of, Information, Systems, When, I, close, my, eyes, and, think, of, the, web,, I, imagine, a, giant, warehouse, filled, with, billions, of, unsorted, documents, –, a, warehouse, far, too, large, and, far, too, dynamic, for, any, human, archivists, to, catalog., I, conjure, an, image, akin, to, a, scene, from, the, Sorcerer’s, Apprentice, where, documents, swirl, and, fill, the, room, in, a, growing, and, uncontrollable, vortex., Taming, this, content, would, seem, a, Herculean, task, absent, the, iterative, tools, used, by, search, engine, companies, to, perpetually, crawl, the, web, to, build/rebuild, searchable, indices., The, notion, of, building, searchable, indices, of, the, content, of, the, web, is, the, product, of, a, simpler, time., The, early, web, was, comprised, of, only, a, handful, of, sites, where, academics, and, the, scientific, community, could, share, their, work., Even, then,, it, was, challenging, to, keep, track, of, newly, available, content., In, 1990,, Archie, became, the, first, widely, available, search, tool, and, allowed, users, to, download, a, searchable, index, of, directory, listings, collected, monthly, from, participating, sites., Search, strategies, have, matured, over, the, last, few, decades, coincident, to, our, dependence, on, them, to, provide, us, with, the, most, relevant, links, to, answer, our, numerous, queries., Google, reports, they, answer, over, 100, billion, user, queries, per, month,, 15%, of, whom, have, never, been, seen, before, by, Google’, search, engine., Our, thirst, for, information, is, insatiable., We, have, become, increasingly, dependent, on, search, engines, to, direct, us, to, the, best, content, on, the, web, to, inform, our, queries., Yet,, we, have, no, measure, of, goodness, to, know, the, relative, quality, of, the, links, returned., In, 2007,, Dogpile.com,, working, in, conjunction, with, researchers, from, Queensland, University, of, Technology, and, Pennsylvania, State, University,, conducted, research, to, assess, the, homogeneity, of, results, returned, by, the, top, four, search, engines,, Google,, Yahoo!,, Windows, Live™(formerly, MSN, search), and, Ask™(formerly, Ask, Jeeves)., Measuring, 19,332, user-entered, search, queries,, they, found, the, average, overlap, across, the, first, page, of, results, returned, by, these, engines, for, a, given, query, was, a, staggeringly, low, 0.6, percent., This, raises, questions, regarding, the, thoroughness, with, which, the, content, of, our, “giant, warehouse”, is, indexed, by, different, search, engines, and, the, quality, of, their, algorithms, and, indexing, schemes., Information, is, often, described, as, data, in, context., Yet, context, is, a, confounding, variable, for, search., Differences, in, the, ways, in, which, search, engines, weight, the, relevance, of, various, links, highlights, the, challenge, they, face, in, correctly, interpreting, the, intended, context, of, our, queries., When, someone, searches, on, the, term, “diamond”,, are, they, thinking, of, a, baseball, diamond,, the, suit, of, diamonds, on, playing, cards,, precious, stones, used, in, jewelry,, or, basic, geometric, shapes?, Correct, context, resolution, typically, requires, the, searcher, to, iteratively, refine, their, search, with, additional, or, different, terms., It, becomes, an, exercise, that, can, be, understood, as, rinse,, lather, and, repeat., Discovery, of, necessary, or, additional, terms, often, depends, on, serendipity., Each, day,, users, iteratively, resolve, contexts, for, several, billion, searches., Where, is, the, result, of, their, efforts, stored?, How, does, their, work, make, it, easier, for, the, next, searcher?, Despite, billions, of, searches, each, day,, the, web, gets, no, smarter., While, indexing, an, unordered, content, collection, is, a, reasonable, strategy, when, the, number, of, elements, in, that, collection, is, small,, it, is, not, an, efficient, strategy, when, scaled, to, accommodate, the, vast, content, of, the, web., My, co-researchers, and, I, propose, a, very, different, strategy., We, are, working, to, develop, a, web, 2.0, tool, to, harness, the, power, of, the, crowd, to, organize, the, content, of, the, web, rather, than, perpetually, re-index, it., Will, this, impact, the, quality, of, information, available, to, searchers?, Maybe., In, an, informal, experiment,, I, recently, visited, a, numismatic, message, board, and, asked, the, members, to, each, share, their, personal, lists, of, the, five, best, numismatic, websites., Thirty-five, members, responded., Their, aggregate, recommendations, identified, 84, unique, websites., Of, these,, fewer, than, 10, overlapped, those, on, the, first, page, of, results, returned, by, the, top, three, search, engines, for, the, term, “numismatics”., We, hope, our, platform, will, tap, the, tacit, knowledge, of, the, community, to, help, identify, the, best, information, on, the, web, to, inform, a, particular, topic., We, are, currently, prototyping, a, social, platform, that, lets, the, crowd, determine, how, to, organize, web, content, and, decide, which, content, (in, the, form, of, links), is, best, for, each, topic, (a, democratic, and, dynamic, process)., Our, platform, intends, to, allow, the, crowd, to, recommend, new, topics, and, subtopics, to, produce, unique, contexts, where, link, lists, can, be, stored., Each, topic,, subtopic, and, associated, links, will, be, democratically, nominated, and, approved, by, the, crowd., For, example,, if, a, user, recommends, addition, of, the, topic, “Wine”, and, that, addition, is, supported, by, a, sufficient, number, of, unique, users,, it, would, become, part, of, the, contextual, rhizome, of, the, platform., The, next, user, might, see, the, need, to, expand, the, root, topic, by, recommending, the, subtopics, “Red, Wine”, and, “White, Wine”., In, this, case, “Wine”,, “White, Wine”, and, “Red, Wine”, would, each, become, unique, contexts., Topical, extension, can, continue, to, accommodate, all, related, contextual, chains, arising, from, the, root, topic., Content, to, populate, each, context, will, be, supplied, by, users, who, recommend, links, to, the, websites, which, best, inform, them., Each, context, on, a, topic/subtopic, chain, can, accommodate, up, to, seven, links, to, external, websites, which, best, inform, them, (content)., These, links, will, be, ordered, based, on, the, votes, of, the, crowd., When, the, number, of, recommended, links, for, a, particular, context, exceed, seven,, the, excess, recommendations, are, placed, into, a, pool, and, rotated, into, a, wildcard, slot, at, the, bottom, of, the, link, list., Many, hands, make, light, work., It, is, our, hope, that, this, platform, will, allow, global, users, to, create, for, themselves, a, searchable, rhizome, of, topical, contexts, populated, with, democratically, nominated, content, (i.e.,, lists, of, links, to, the, best, sites, on, the, web)., This, human-centric, open, platform, approach, invites, the, crowd, to, determine, which, content, is, most, important, for, each, context., It, flips, search, on, its, head, by, resolving, context, first, rather, than, content., In, the, best, tradition, of, web, 2.0,, we, intend, to, build, the, platform, and, give, the, creation, and, management, of, its, content, to, the, crowd., We, want, to, re-imagine, the, web, a, knowledge, management, system, owned, and, organized, by, the, crowd., FollowFollowingUnfollowDon, Heath, Sign, in, to, follow, this, author, Don, Heath, Assistant, Professor, of, Information, Systems, 2, articles, Looking, for,
