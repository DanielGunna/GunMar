is, leaving, the, magazine, after, a, quietly, glorious, forty-three-year, career., Copy, editing, —, two, words, —, may, sound, to, outsiders, like, a, job, of, lesser, significance,, but, it, is,, in, fact,, fairly, monumental. The, New, Yorker, has, an, idiosyncratic, and, byzantine, array, of, house, rules, concerning, style;, I, wrote, some, years, back, about, the, disconcerting, experience, of, being, edited, by, the, legendary, Eleanor, Gould, Packard., Ann, has, long, been, the, supreme, custodian, of, the, sense, of, a, New, Yorker, voice,, and, she, has, a, way, of, applying, those, rules, without, disrupting, the, flow, of, a, writer's, thought., Indeed,, being, herself, a, writer, and, translator, of, great, skill,, she, invariably, makes, the, prose, more, elegant., It, is, as, if, a, slightly, blurry, image, were, snapping, into, perfect, focus., I, learned, as, much, about, writing, from, Ann, as, from, any, teacher, in, school., (She, would, surely, have, improved, that, sentence.), The, loss, is, made, heavier, by, the, recent, departure, of, the, no, less, beloved, Mary, Norris,, another, copy-editing, mainstay., Not, long, ago,, Mary, embarked, on, a, new, career, as, an, author,, with, her, book, Between, You, &, Me:, Confessions, of, a, Comma, Queen., Ann,, too,, has, lately, moved, into, the, limelight,, with, her, acclaimed, translations, of, Primo, Levi, and, Elena, Ferrante,, among, others., We, New, Yorker, writers, are, tremendously, happy, for, them,, and, yet, it, is, difficult, to, say, farewell, to, editors, of, such, brilliance,, not, least, because, they, make, us, all, look, better,, one, clarifying, comma, at, a, time., My, own, gratitude, is, limitless., "Almost, limitless?", Ann, might, suggest,,
