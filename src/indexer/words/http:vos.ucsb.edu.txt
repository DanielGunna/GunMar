effectiveness,, diversity,, and, techno/spirituality"), (Richard, Thieme), Welcome, to, the, new, VoS., Started, in, 1994, as, a, suite, of, static, Web, pages,, VoS, has, now, been, rebuilt, as, a, database, that, serves, content, dynamically, on, the, Web., Users, gain, greater, flexibility, in, viewing, and, searching,, while, editors, are, able, to, work, more, efficiently, and, flexibly., We've, tried, to, maintain, most, of, the, original, structure, of, the, site,, which, models, the, way, the, humanities, are, organized, for, research, and, teaching, as, well, as, the, way, they, are, adapting, to, social,, cultural,, and, technological, changes., But, some, shifts, in, organization, and, navigation, are, necessary, for, technical, reasons., (Navigating, and, Bookmarking, VoS), Important:, the, new, VoS, is, still, a, work, in, progress,, but, we, have, turned, it, on, because, it, is, already, more, functional, than, the, original, site., There, are, still, some, mis-orderings, of, categories, and, author, names, that, we, are, fixing, as, we, convert, our, legacy, resources., We've, also, temporarily, removed, as, many, of, the, broken, links, as, we, could, find, and, will, restore, them, when, we, can, (or, find, substitutes)., Some, categories, have, thus, been, temporarily, decimated., If, Michel, Foucault, wrote, about, The, Order, of, Things,, then, VoS, may, be, said, to, be, about, "the, ordering, of, things"the, ceaseless, reconfiguration, of, humanities, knowledge, assisted, by, the, new, technologies, of, dynamic, information.,  ,   , VoS, on, Forbes, "Best, of, Web":, Forbes, magazine, lists, VoS, in, its, Summer, 2002, Best, of, the, Web, directory, (in, the, category, for, Academic, Research).,   , Google's, "Glossary":, Experimental, new, feature, on, the, Google, search, site., Searching, for, "words,, phrases,, and, acronyms", yields, definitions, and, links, to, originating, glossary, or, definition, sites., Try, searching, on, string, theory, or, Gothic.,   , Sign, up, for, free, VoS, accounts, that, allow, you, to, suggest, links, for, specific, pages, on, the, site, (how, to, contribute, links)., Suggestions, appear, right, away, under, "Unvetted, Submissions", (and, later, on, the, regular, pages, after, being, reviewed, by, VoS, editors)., Currently,, the, site, is, best, viewed, in, Internet, Explorer, 5+, and, Netscape, 6+., We, are, still, working, on, full, compatability, with, Netscape, 4.x., Other, interface, and, usability, improvements, will, be, introduced, in, the, future., In, a, later, implementation, phase, of, the, new, VoS,, users, who, have, signed, up, for, accounts, will, have, additional, editorial, privileges, allowing, them, to, maintain/revise, links, that, they, have, contributed., There, will, also, be, group, accounts, that, enable, classes,, organizations,, conferences,, etc., to, build, subsets, of, VoS, resources, that, will, appear, both, on, the, regular, VoS, pages, and, on, a, special, page, set, aside, for, the, group, (e.g.,, the, "English, 130,", "History, 186,", or, "Conference, 2001", VoS, Resources, Page)., VoS, will, thus, be, an, open, platform, serving, the, needs, of, both, general, and, specific, communities, of, users., (Contributions, will, be, subject, to, editorial, review, by, Alan, Liu, and, VoS, editorial, assistants, to, maintain, overall, quality,, consistency,, and, sense, of, context.), VoS, is, woven, by, Alan, Liu, of, the, U., California,, Santa, Barbara,, English, Department, with, a, team, of, department, graduate, students, and, others., Robert, Adlington, and, Jeremy, Douglass, developed, the, SQL, Server, database, and, ASP, and, VB, code, for, the, site, (their, creative, ideas, were, instrumental, to, the, project)., Brian, Reynolds, built, the, server, machine, for, the, database,, integrated, it, with, the, separate, Web, server,, and, oversaw, networking., Bo, Kinloch, took, the, lead, in, graphic, design., And, Andrea, Fontenot,, Christien, Hoffpauir,, and, Jennifer, Jones, assisted, with, editing, and, other, tasks, during, the, migration, to, the, new, format., VoS, is, woven, by, Alan, Liu, and, a, development, team, in, the, U.California,, Santa, Barbara,, English, Department., Contact:, ayliu@english.ucsb.edu,  To, suggest, links, for, inclusion,
