Webcams, Purpose, of, the, List, The, purpose, of, this, list, is, two-fold., First,, it, was, created, to, help, editors, decide, on, the, appropriate, terms, to, use, when, grouping, sites, that, are, related, to, one, another, by, their, form, (e.g.,, Chat, Rooms, and, Message, Boards,, News,, Directories)., This, supports, an, DMOZ, Guideline, for, choosing, subcategory, names:, "Where, a, category's, resources, are, related, to, one, another, by, their, form, (e.g.,, Chat, Rooms, and, Message, Boards,, News, sites,, Directories),, a, good, subcategory, name, usually, uses, the, word, that, is, used, most, frequently, in, other, areas, in, pertinent, top, category.", This, Preferred, Term, List, saves, the, editor, a, significant, amount, of, time, and, labor, wading, through, categories, to, find, the, "most, frequently", used, term., It, centralizes, the, most, appropriate, and, frequently, used, terms, for, categories, of, sites, that, are, grouped, together, based, on, their, form., Secondly,, this, list, was, created, to, help, editors, interested, in, standardizing, their, subcategories, to, identify, what, terms, need, to, be, replaced, and, what, terms, to, use, as, replacements., Top, How, to, Use, the, List, For, each, term,, there, is, a, "Preferred, Term", listed, in, bold, face., Underneath, you'll, see, a, brief, description, and, information, about, the, scope, of, the, term., Below, that,, you'll, see, a, list, of, "Use, ___, instead, of:", terms., These, terms, actually, come, from, the, directory,, and, although, some, might, be, outdated,, they, should, give, editors, an, idea, of, what, type, of, terms, need, to, be, replaced., This, means, that, if, you, are, using, any, of, these, terms, in, your, category,, you, are, encouraged, to, change, the, category, name, to, the, Preferred, term., Changes, should, be, made, in, the, appropriate, Rename/Move/Delete/Sort, Requests, thread, in, each, forum., Also,, remember, the, guideline, which, suggests, that, "Helpful, subcategory, names, do, not, repeat, the, name, of, the, parent, category"., Thus,, when, applying, these, preferred, terms,, it, is, generally, best, to, avoid, prefixing, the, preferred, term, with, all, or, part, of, the, parent, category, name., Thus,, use, Sports:, Events, rather, than, Sports/Sporting_Events., Preferred, Term, Scope:, Description, of, scope., Use, Preferred, Term, instead, of:, Term, 1, Term, 2, Term, 3, Term, 4, Top, Maintaining, the, List, While, staff, has, established, this, list,, it, is, expected, that, the, community, will, be, responsible, for, its, future, growth,, development, and, management., Admins, will, maintain, that, list, in, its, current, form,, but, changes, will, not, be, made, without, agreement, from, the, community., Editors, should, start, and, maintain, a, running, Ontology, thread, about, the, maintenance, and, development, of, this, list., Admins, will, monitor, the, forum, and, update, the, list, as, necessary., Top, Enforcing, the, Use, of, Preferred, Terms, While, editors, are, not, required, to, use, the, terms, on, this, list, for, category, names,, they, are, highly, recommended, in, order, to, create, a, consistent,, predictable,, and, standardized, taxonomy., Editors, are, encouraged, to, use, this, list,, in, the, interest, of, uniform, searching, across, the, directory,, but, it's, up, to, the, editors, as, to, when, it's, appropriate, to, use, a, variation, of, a, term, or, phrase, when, that, makes, sense, for, a, particular, category., Category, editors, should, consult, top, level,, editall,, meta,, or, even, admin, editors, if, they, have, a, question, about, when, a, term, is, appropriate., Upper, level, editors, should, also, promote, the, use, of, the, Preferred, Term, list, within, their, categories., In, addition,, editors, in, some, large, Directory, branches, have, agreed, to, use, branch-specific, preferred, terms, for, their, categories., In, the, case, of, disagreement, between, terms, in, this, list, and, those, in, branch, guidelines,, editors, are, encouraged, to, use, the, branch, specific, term., For, example,, the, Regional, template, uses, Maps_and_Views, and, Guides_and_Directories, rather, than, the, terms, in, this, list., It, is, recommended, that, editors, become, aware, of, any, category, naming, conventions, in, areas, where, they, edit., Branch-specific, Preferred, Terms:, Regional, Template, Topical, Subcategories, Regional, Template, Topical, Subcategories, -, British, English, Shopping">Shopping, -,
