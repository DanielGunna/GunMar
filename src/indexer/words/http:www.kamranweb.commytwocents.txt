[My, Two, Cents..., This, weeks, movie, review, is, on..., Head, of, State, (2003), When, the, gangsta-rap, group, N.W.A., put, themselves, in, the, White, House, in, one, of, their, videos,, it, was, a, surrealistic,, confrontational, statement., Fourteen, years, later,, the, image, of, the, hip-hop, politician, is, still, nonexistent, outside, the, media's, fantasy, world., Chris, Rock's, take, on, the, concept, his, directorial, debut, Head, of, State, is, not, a, good, film,, but, it's, interesting, to, see, how, one, of, America's, best, comedians, becomes, very, unfunny, on, the, big, screen., Just, as, Charlie, Chaplin, dulled, when, he, abandoned, sheer, physicality,, Rock's, combativeness, has, been, softened,, negating, his, biting, racial, messages., Here,, he, cops, neither, the, thug-persona, of, hardcore, rappers, who, would, never, get, elected, anyway,, nor, the, Vanilla, Ice, act, of, Warren, Beatty, in, Bulworth., Rock, is,, instead,, the, boyish, good, guy,, a, Mr., Smith, going, to, Washington, used, by, the, Democratic, Party, to, garner, the, favor, of, the, growing, minority, population., He, tells, it, like, it, is,, works, his, followers, into, a, churchy, frenzy,, and, uses, profanity, to, show, that, he's, real., Head, of, State, coughs, up, cliches;, the, villain, is, a, Republican, nationalist,, journalists, are, conservative, enemies,, and, black, women, are, gold-diggers., The, redundant, soundtrack, consists, mainly, of, Nelly, and, Jay-Z,, which, would, be, a, jab, at, radio's, boring,, corporate-controlled, playlists, if, it, didn't, represent, Rock's, shallow, hip-hop, appreciation, and, short-term, memory, for, popular, music., Rap, infiltrates, a, gathering, of, wealthy, whites, in, a, nod, to, Eve's, "Let, Me, Blow, Ya, Mind", video., Neither, Rock, nor, his, opponent, make, valid, presidential, candidates,, and, we, receive, no, indication, that, our, hero, would, have, the, ability, to, back, up, his, simplistic, populism., There, has, yet, to, be, a, legitimate, hip-hop, president, in, the, movies,, so, who, knows, how, long, we'll, have, to, wait, for, one, in, real, life., There, was, a, time, not, too, long, ago, when, the, credit, "Directed, by, Chris, Rock", would, have, been, unthinkable, on, a, mainstream, box-office, smash;, in, the, past,, black, directors, have, done, blaxploitation, or, independents., Rock, is, part, of, an, emerging, group, of, young, minorities, at, the, helm, of, Hollywood, movies, shying, away, from, the, atmospheric, art, of, Spike, Lee, and, the, stomping, sermons, of, John, Singleton., The, ghetto, is, now, addressed, with, the, light, touch, new, bourgeois, filmmakers, like, Rick, Famuyiwa, and, Gary, Hardwick, have, popularized., Comically, and, politically, worthless,, Head, of, State, is, at, least, indicative, of, the, new, aesthetic;, the, dumbing-down, of, activism, has, been, the, cost, of, acceptance., By, Andrew, Chan,

diverse, films, as, GO,, BIG, FISH,, CORPSE, BRIDE,, and, CHARLIE'S, ANGELS,, makes, his, directorial, debut, with, THE, NINES,, a, complex,, thought-provoking, work, divided, into, three, sections, and, featuring, the, same, actors, playing, different, roles,, with, the, number, nine, always, lurking, in, the, background., In, "The, Prisoner,", Ryan, Reynolds, plays, Gary,, a, TV, star, who, has, been, placed, under, house, arrest, after, going, crazy, because, his, girlfriend, dumped, him., He, is, watched, closely, by, Margaret, (Melissa, McCarthy,, from, THE, GILMORE, GIRLS),, a, publicist, who, seems, to, know, more, than, she, is, letting, on,, and, by, neighbor, Sarah, (Hope, Davis),, who, is, instantly, attracted, to, him., In, "Reality, Television,", Reynolds, is, a, director, named, Gavin, who, is, shooting, a, TV, pilot, starring, McCarthy, (playing, a, version, of, herself),, but, he's, getting, mixed, signals, from, studio, executive, Susan, (Davis),, all, while, being, filmed, for, a, television, reality, program., And, in, "Knowing,", Reynolds, is, Gabriel,, the, character, in, the, TV, pilot, that, Gavin, was, shooting,, with, McCarthy, playing, his, wife,, Mary,, and, Davis, as, a, mysterious, stranger, deciding, whether, she, should, help, the, family,, whose, car, has, broken, down, on, a, deserted, mountain., Certain, minute, elements, repeat, in, each, part,, giving, clues, as, to, what, it's, all, really, about, as, fantasy, and, reality, intertwine., David, Denman, (THE, OFFICE), and, Elle, Fanning, also, appear, in, each, section,, while, Dahlia, Salem, (ER), and, Ben, Falcone, (McCarthy's, real-life, husband), play, themselves, within, fictional, worlds., THE, NINES, is, a, fascinating, exploration, of, art, and, character, that,, of, course,, runs, 99, minutes., Copyright, Â©, 2009, Kamran, Web]
