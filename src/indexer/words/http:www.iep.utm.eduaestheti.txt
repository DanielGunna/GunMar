defined, narrowly, as, the, theory, of, beauty,, or, more, broadly, as, that, together, with, the, philosophy, of, art., The, traditional, interest, in, beauty, itself, broadened,, in, the, eighteenth, century,, to, include, the, sublime,, and, since, 1950, or, so, the, number, of, pure, aesthetic, concepts, discussed, in, the, literature, has, expanded, even, more., Traditionally,, the, philosophy, of, art, concentrated, on, its, definition,, but, recently, this, has, not, been, the, focus,, with, careful, analyses, of, aspects, of, art, largely, replacing, it., Philosophical, aesthetics, is, here, considered, to, center, on, these, latter-day, developments., Thus,, after, a, survey, of, ideas, about, beauty, and, related, concepts,, questions, about, the, value, of, aesthetic, experience, and, the, variety, of, aesthetic, attitudes, will, be, addressed,, before, turning, to, matters, which, separate, art, from, pure, aesthetics,, notably, the, presence, of, intention., That, will, lead, to, a, survey, of, some, of, the, main, definitions, of, art, which, have, been, proposed,, together, with, an, account, of, the, recent, “de-definition”, period., The, concepts, of, expression,, representation,, and, the, nature, of, art, objects, will, then, be, covered., Table, of, Contents, Introduction, Aesthetic, Concepts, Aesthetic, Value, Aesthetic, Attitudes, Intentions, Definitions, of, Art, Expression, Representation, Art, Objects, References, and, Further, Reading, 1., Introduction, The, full, field, of, what, might, be, called, “aesthetics”, is, a, very, large, one., There, is, even, now, a, four-volume, encyclopedia, devoted, to, the, full, range, of, possible, topics., The, core, issues, in, Philosophical, Aesthetics,, however,, are, nowadays, fairly, settled, (see, the, book, edited, by, Dickie,, Sclafani,, and, Roblin,, and, the, monograph, by, Sheppard,, among, many, others)., Aesthetics, in, this, central, sense, has, been, said, to, start, in, the, early, eighteenth, century,, with, the, series, of, articles, on, “The, Pleasures, of, the, Imagination”, which, the, journalist, Joseph, Addison, wrote, in, the, early, issues, of, the, magazine The, Spectator, in, 1712., Before, this, time,, thoughts, by, notable, figures, made, some, forays, into, this, ground,, for, instance, in, the, formulation, of, general, theories, of, proportion, and, harmony,, detailed, most, specifically, in, architecture, and, music., But, the, full, development, of, extended,, philosophical, reflection, on, Aesthetics, did, not, begin, to, emerge, until, the, widening, of, leisure, activities, in, the, eighteenth, century., By, far, the, most, thoroughgoing, and, influential, of, the, early, theorists, was Immanuel, Kant,, towards, the, end, of, the, eighteenth, century., Therefore, it, is, important,, first, of, all,, to, have, some, sense, of, how, Kant, approached, the, subject., Criticisms, of, his, ideas,, and, alternatives, to, them,, will, be, presented, later, in, this, entry,, but, through, him, we, can, meet, some, of, the, key, concepts, in, the, subject, by, way, of, introduction., Kant, is, sometimes, thought, of, as, a, formalist, in, art, theory;, that, is, to, say,, someone, who, thinks, the, content, of, a, work, of, art, is, not, of, aesthetic, interest., But, this, is, only, part, of, the, story., Certainly, he, was, a, formalist, about, the, pure, enjoyment, of, nature,, but, for, Kant, most, of, the, arts, were, impure,, because, they, involved, a, “concept.”, Even, the, enjoyment, of, parts, of, nature, was, impure,, namely, when, a, concept, was, involved—, as, when, we, admire, the, perfection, of, an, animal, body, or, a, human, torso., But, our, enjoyment, of,, for, instance,, the, arbitrary, abstract, patterns, in, some, foliage,, or, a, color, field, (as, with, wild, poppies,, or, a, sunset), was,, according, to, Kant,, absent, of, such, concepts;, in, such, cases,, the, cognitive, powers, were, in, free, play., By, design,, art, may, sometimes, obtain, the, appearance, of, this, freedom:, it, was, then, “Fine, Art”—but, for, Kant, not, all, art, had, this, quality., In, all,, Kant’s, theory, of, pure, beauty, had, four, aspects:, its, freedom, from, concepts,, its, objectivity,, the, disinterest, of, the, spectator,, and, its, obligatoriness., By, “concept,”, Kant, meant, “end,”, or, “purpose,”, that, is,, what, the, cognitive, powers, of, human, understanding, and, imagination, judge, applies, to, an, object,, such, as, with, “it, is, a, pebble,”, to, take, an, instance., But, when, no, definite, concept, is, involved,, as, with, the, scattered, pebbles, on, a, beach,, the, cognitive, powers, are, held, to, be, in, free, play;, and, it, is, when, this, play, is, harmonious, that, there, is, the, experience, of, pure, beauty., There, is, also, objectivity, and, universality, in, the, judgment, then,, according, to, Kant,, since, the, cognitive, powers, are, common, to, all, who, can, judge, that, the, individual, objects, are, pebbles., These, powers, function, alike, whether, they, come, to, such, a, definite, judgment, or, are, left, suspended, in, free, play,, as, when, appreciating, the, pattern, along, the, shoreline., This, was, not, the, basis, on, which, the, apprehension, of, pure, beauty, was, obligatory,, however., According, to, Kant,, that, derived, from, the, selflessness, of, such, an, apprehension,, what, was, called, in, the, eighteenth, century, its, “disinterest.”, This, arises, because, pure, beauty, does, not, gratify, us, sensuously;, nor, does, it, induce, any, desire, to, possess, the, object., It, “pleases,”, certainly,, but, in, a, distinctive, intellectual, way., Pure, beauty,, in, other, words,, simply, holds, our, mind’s, attention:, we, have, no, further, concern, than, contemplating, the, object, itself., Perceiving, the, object, in, such, cases, is, an, end, in, itself;, it, is, not, a, means, to, a, further, end,, and, is, enjoyed, for, its, own, sake, alone., It, is, because, Morality, requires, we, rise, above, ourselves, that, such, an, exercise, in, selfless, attention, becomes, obligatory., Judgments, of, pure, beauty,, being, selfless,, initiate, one, into, the, moral, point, of, view., “Beauty, is, a, symbol, of, Morality,”, and, “The, enjoyment, of, nature, is, the, mark, of, a, good, soul”, are, key, sayings, of, Kant., The, shared, enjoyment, of, a, sunset, or, a, beach, shows, there, is, harmony, between, us, all,, and, the, world., Among, these, ideas,, the, notion, of, “disinterest”, has, had, much, the, widest, currency., Indeed,, Kant, took, it, from, eighteenth, century, theorists, before, him,, such, as, the, moral, philosopher,, Lord, Shaftesbury,, and, it, has, attracted, much, attention, since:, recently, by, the, French, sociologist, Pierre, Bourdieu,, for, instance., Clearly,, in, this, context, “disinterested”, does, not, mean, “uninterested,”, and, paradoxically, it, is, closest, to, what, we, now, call, our, “interests,”, that, is,, such, things, as, hobbies,, travel,, and, sport,, as, we, shall, see, below., But, in, earlier, centuries,, one’s, “interest”, was, what, was, to, one’s, advantage,, that, is,, it, was, “self-interest,”, and, so, it, was, the, negation, of, that, which, closely, related, aesthetics, to, ethics., 2., Aesthetic, Concepts, The, eighteenth, century, was, a, surprisingly, peaceful, time,, but, this, turned, out, to, be, the, lull, before, the, storm,, since, out, of, its, orderly, classicism, there, developed, a, wild, romanticism, in, art, and, literature,, and, even, revolution, in, politics., The, aesthetic, concept, which, came, to, be, more, appreciated, in, this, period, was, associated, with, this,, namely, sublimity,, which, Edmund, Burke, theorized, about, in, his, “A, Philosophical, Enquiry, into, the, Origin, of, our, ideas, of, the, Sublime, and, Beautiful.”, The, sublime, was, connected, more, with, pain, than, pure, pleasure,, according, to, Burke,, since, threats, to, self-preservation, were, involved,, as, on, the, high, seas,, and, lonely, moors,, with, the, devilish, humans, and, dramatic, passions, that, artists, and, writers, were, about, to, portray., But, in, these, circumstances,, of, course,, it, is, still, “delightful, horror,”, as, Burke, appreciated,, since, one, is, insulated, by, the, fictionality, of, the, work, in, question, from, any, real, danger., “Sublime”, and, “beautiful”, are, only, two, amongst, the, many, terms, which, may, be, used, to, describe, our, aesthetic, experiences., Clearly, there, are, “ridiculous”, and, “ugly,”, for, a, start,, as, well., But, the, more, discriminating, will, have, no, difficulty, also, finding, something, maybe, “fine,”, or, “lovely”, rather, than, “awful”, or, “hideous,”, and, “exquisite”, or, “superb”, rather, than, “gross”, or, “foul.”, Frank, Sibley, wrote, a, notable, series, of, articles,, starting, in, 1959,, defending, a, view, of, aesthetic, concepts, as, a, whole., He, said, that, they, were, not, rule-, or, condition-governed,, but, required, a, heightened, form, of, perception,, which, one, might, call, taste,, sensitivity,, or, judgment., His, full, analysis,, however,, contained, another, aspect,, since, he, was, not, only, concerned, with, the, sorts, of, concepts, mentioned, above,, but, also, with, a, set, of, others, which, had, a, rather, different, character., For, one, can, describe, works, of, art,, often, enough,, in, terms, which, relate, primarily, to, the, emotional, and, mental, life, of, human, beings., One, can, call, them, “joyful,”, “melancholy,”, “serene,”, “witty,”, “vulgar,”, and, “humble,”, for, instance., These, are, evidently, not, purely, aesthetic, terms,, because, of, their, further, uses,, but, they, are, still, very, relevant, to, many, aesthetic, experiences., Sibley’s, claim, about, these, concepts, was, that, there, were, no, sufficient, conditions, for, their, application., For, many, concepts—sometimes, called, “closed”, concepts,, as, a, result—both, necessary, and, sufficient, conditions, for, their, application, can, be, given., To, be, a, bachelor,, for, instance,, it, is, necessary, to, be, male, and, unmarried,, though, of, marriageable, age,, and, together, these, three, conditions, are, sufficient., For, other, concepts,, however,, the, so-called, “open”, ones,, no, such, definitions, can, be, given—, although, for, aesthetic, concepts, Sibley, pointed, out, there, were, still, some, necessary, conditions,, since, certain, facts, can, rule, out, the, application, of,, for, example,, “garish,”, “gaudy,”, or, “flamboyant.”, The, question, therefore, arises:, how, do, we, make, aesthetic, judgments, if, not, by, checking, sufficient, conditions?, Sibley’s, account, was, that,, when, the, concepts, were, not, purely, perceptual, they, were, mostly, metaphoric., Thus,, we, call, artworks, “dynamic,”, or, “sad,”, as, before,, by, comparison, with, the, behaviors, of, humans, with, those, qualities., Other, theorists,, such, as, Rudolph, Arnheim, and, Roger, Scruton,, have, held, similar, views., Scruton,, in, fact,, discriminated, eight, types, of, aesthetic, concept,, and, we, shall, look, at, some, of, the, others, below., 3., Aesthetic, Value, We, have, noted, Kant’s, views, about, the, objectivity, and, universality, of, judgments, of, pure, beauty,, and, there, are, several, ways, that, these, notions, have, been, further, defended., There, is, a, famous, curve,, for, instance,, obtained, by, the, nineteenth, century, psychologist, Wilhelm, Wundt,, which, shows, how, human, arousal, is, quite, generally, related, to, complexity, of, stimulus., We, are, bored, by, the, simple,, become, sated,, even, over-anxious,, by, the, increasingly, complex,, while, in, between, there, is, a, region, of, greatest, pleasure., The, dimension, of, complexity, is, only, one, objective, measure, of, worth, which, has, been, proposed, in, this, way., Thus, it, is, now, known,, for, instance,, that, judgments, of, facial, beauty, in, humans, are, a, matter, of, averageness, and, symmetry., Traditionally,, unity, was, taken, to, be, central,, notably, by, Aristotle, in, connection, with, Drama,, and, when, added, to, complexity, it, formed, a, general, account, of, aesthetic, value., Thus, Francis, Hutcheson,, in, the, eighteenth, century,, asserted, that, “Uniformity, in, variety, always, makes, an, object, beautiful.”, Monroe, Beardsley,, more, recently,, has, introduced, a, third, criterion—intensity—to, produce, his, three, “General, Canons”, of, objective, worth., He, also, detailed, some, “Special, Canons.”, Beardsley, called, the, objective, criteria, within, styles, of, Art, “Special, Canons.”, These, were, not, a, matter, of, something, being, good, of, its, kind, and, so, involving, perfection, of, a, concept, in, the, sense, of, Kant., They, involved, defeasible, “good-making”, and, “bad-making”, features,, more, in, the, manner, Hume, explained, in, his, major, essay, in, this, area,, “Of, the, Standard, of, Taste”, (1757)., To, say, a, work, of, art, had, a, positive, quality, like, humor,, for, instance,, was, to, praise, it, to, some, degree,, but, this, could, be, offset, by, other, qualities, which, made, the, work, not, good, as, a, whole., Beardsley, defended, all, of, his, canons, in, a, much, more, detailed, way, than, his, eighteenth, century, predecessor, however:, through, a, lengthy,, fine-grained,, historical, analysis, of, what, critics, have, actually, appealed, to, in, the, evaluation, of, artworks., Also,, he, explicitly, made, the, disclaimer, that, his, canons, were, the, only, criteria, of, value,, by, separating, these, “objective, reasons”, from, what, he, called, “affective”, and, “genetic”, reasons., These, two, other, sorts, of, reasons, were, to, do, with, audience, response,, and, the, originating, artist, and, his, times,, respectively,, and, either, “The, Affective, Fallacy”, or, “The, Intentional, Fallacy,”, he, maintained,, was, involved, if, these, were, considered., The, discrimination, enabled, Beardsley, to, focus, on, the, artwork, and, its, representational, relations,, if, any,, to, objects, in, the, public, world., Against, Beardsley,, over, many, years,, Joseph, Margolis, maintained, a, “Robust, Relativism.”, Thus, he, wanted, to, say, that, “aptness,”, “partiality,”, and, “non-cognitivism”, characterize, art, appreciation,, rather, than, “truth,”, “universality,”, and, “knowledge.”, He, defended, this, with, respect, to, aesthetic, concepts,, critical, judgments, of, value,, and, literary, interpretations, in, particular,, saying,, more, generally,, that, works, of, art, were, “culturally, emergent, entities”, not, directly, accessible,, because, of, this,, to, any, faculty, resembling, sense, perception., The, main, debate, over, aesthetic, value,, indeed,, concerns, social, and, political, matters,, and, the, seemingly, inevitable, partiality, of, different, points, of, view., The, central, question, concerns, whether, there, is, a, privileged, class,, namely, those, with, aesthetic, interests,, or, whether, their, set, of, interests, has, no, distinguished, place,, since,, from, a, sociological, perspective,, that, taste, is, just, one, amongst, all, other, tastes, in, the, democratic, economy., The, sociologist, Arnold, Hauser, preferred, a, non-relativistic, point, of, view,, and, was, prepared, to, give, a, ranking, of, tastes., High, art, beat, popular, art,, Hauser, said,, because, of, two, things:, the, significance, of, its, content,, and, the, more, creative, nature, of, its, forms., Roger, Taylor,, by, contrast,, set, out, very, fully, the, “leveller’s”, point, of, view,, declaring, that, "Aida", and, "The, Sound, of, Music", have, equal, value, for, their, respective, audiences., He, defended, this, with, a, thorough, philosophical, analysis,, rejecting, the, idea, that, there, is, such, a, thing, as, truth, corresponding, to, an, external, reality,, with, the, people, capable, of, accessing, that, truth, having, some, special, value., Instead,, according, to, Taylor,, there, are, just, different, conceptual, schemes,, in, which, truth, is, measured, merely, by, coherence, internal, to, the, scheme, itself., Janet, Wolff, looked, at, this, debate, more, disinterestedly,, in, particular, studying, the, details, of, the, opposition, between, Kant, and, Bourdieu., 4., Aesthetic, Attitudes, Jerome, Stolnitz,, in, the, middle, of, the, last, century,, was, a, Kantian,, and, promoted, the, need, for, a, disinterested,, objective, attitude, to, art, objects., It, is, debatable,, as, we, saw, before,, whether, this, represents, Kant’s, total, view, of, art,, but, the, disinterested, treatment, of, art, objects, which, Stolnitz, recommended, was, very, commonly, pursued, in, his, period., Edward, Bullough,, writing, in, 1912,, would, have, called, “disinterested, attention”, a, “distanced”, attitude,, but, he, used, this, latter, term, to, generate, a, much, fuller, and, more, detailed, appreciation, of, the, whole, spectrum, of, attitudes, which, might, be, taken, to, artworks., The, spectrum, stretched, from, people, who, “over-distance”, to, people, who, “under-distance.”, People, who, over-distance, are,, for, instance,, critics, who, merely, look, at, the, technicalities, and, craftwork, of, a, production,, missing, any, emotional, involvement, with, what, it, is, about., Bullough, contrasted, this, attitude, with, what, he, called, “under-distancing,”, where, one, might, get, too, gripped, by, the, content., The, country, yokel, who, jumps, upon, the, stage, to, save, the, heroine,, and, the, jealous, husband, who, sees, himself, as, Othello, smothering, his, wife,, are, missing, the, fact, that, the, play, is, an, illusion,, a, fiction,, just, make-believe., Bullough, thought, there, was,, instead,, an, ideal, mid-point, between, his, two, extremes,, thereby, solving, his, “antinomy, of, distance”, by, deciding, there, should, be, the, least, possible, distance, without, its, disappearance., George, Dickie, later, argued, against, both, “disinterest”, and, “distance”, in, a, famous, 1964, paper,, “The, Myth, of, the, Aesthetic, Attitude.”, He, argued, that, we, should, be, able, to, enjoy, all, objects, of, awareness,, whether, “pure, aesthetic”, or, moral., In, fact,, he, thought, the, term, “aesthetic”, could, be, used, in, all, cases,, rejecting, the, idea, that, there, was, some, authorized, way, of, using, the, word, just, to, apply, to, surface, or, formal, features—, the, artwork, as, a, thing, in, itself., As, a, result,, Dickie, concluded, that, the, aesthetic, attitude,, when, properly, understood,, reduced, to, just, close, attention, to, whatever, holds, one’s, mind, in, an, artwork,, against, the, tradition, which, believed, it, had, a, certain, psychological, quality,, or, else, involved, attention, just, to, certain, objects., Art, is, not, the, only, object, to, draw, interest, of, this, pleasurable, kind:, hobbies, and, travel, are, further, examples,, and, sport, yet, another,, as, was, mentioned, briefly, above., In, particular,, the, broadening, of, the, aesthetic, tradition, in, recent, years, has, led, theorists, to, give, more, attention, to, sport., David, Best,, for, instance,, writing, on, sport, and, its, likeness, to, art,, highlighted, how, close, sport, is, to, the, purely, aesthetic., But, he, wanted, to, limit, sport, to, this,, and, insisted, it, had, no, relevance, to, ethics., Best, saw, art, forms, as, distinguished, expressly, by, their, having, the, capacity, to, comment, on, life, situations,, and, hence, bring, in, moral, considerations., No, sport, had, this, further, capacity,, he, thought,, although, the, enjoyment, of, many, sports, may, undoubtedly, be, aesthetic., But, many, art, forms—perhaps, more, clearly, called, “craft-forms”, as, a, result—, also, do, not, comment, on, life, situations, overmuch,, for, example,, décor,, abstract, painting,, and, non-narrative, ballet., And, there, are, many, sports, which, are, pre-eminently, seen, in, moral,, “character-building”, terms,, for, example,, mountaineering,, and, the, various, combat, sports, (like, boxing, and, wrestling)., Perhaps, the, resolution, comes, through, noting, the, division, Best, himself, provides, within, sport-forms,, between,, on, the, one, hand,, “task”, or, “non-purposive”, sports, like, gymnastics,, diving,, and, synchronized, swimming,, which, are, the, ones, he, claims, are, aesthetic,, and, on, the, other, hand, the, “achievement,”, or, “purposive’, sports,, like, those, combat, sports, above., Task, sports, have, less, “art”, in, them,, since, they, are, not, as, creative, as, the, purposive, ones., 5., Intentions, The, traditional, form, of, art, criticism, was, biographical, and, sociological,, taking, into, account, the, conceptions, of, the, artist, and, the, history, of, the, traditions, within, which, the, artist, worked., But, in, the, twentieth, century, a, different,, more, scientific, and, ahistorical, form, of, literary, criticism, grew, up, in, the, United, States, and, Britain:, The, New, Criticism., Like, the, Russian, Formalists, and, French, Structuralists, in, the, same, period,, the, New, Critics, regarded, what, could, be, gleaned, from, the, work, of, art, alone, as, relevant, to, its, assessment,, but, their, specific, position, received, a, much-discussed, philosophical, defense, by, William, Wimsatt, and, Monroe, Beardsley, in, 1946., Beardsley, saw, the, position, as, an, extension, of, “The, Aesthetic, Point, of, View”;, Wimsatt, was, a, practical, critic, personally, engaged, in, the, new, line, of, approach., In, their, essay, “The, Intentional, Fallacy,”, Wimsatt, and, Beardsley, claimed, “the, design, or, intention, of, the, artist, is, neither, available, nor, desirable, as, a, standard, for, judging, the, success, of, a, work, of, literary, art.”, It, was, not, always, available,, since, it, was, often, difficult, to, obtain,, but,, in, any, case,, it, was, not, appropriately, available,, according, to, them,, unless, there, was, evidence, for, it, internal, to, the, finished, work, of, art., Wimsatt, and, Beardsley, allowed, such, forms, of, evidence, for, a, writer’s, intentions,, but, would, allow, nothing, external, to, the, given, text., This, debate, over, intention, in, the, literary, arts, has, raged, with, full, force, into, more, recent, times., A, contemporary, of, Wimsatt, and, Beardsley,, E.D., Hirsch,, has, continued, to, maintain, his, “intentionalist”, point, of, view., Against, him,, Steven, Knapp, and, Walter, Benn, Michaels, have, taken, up, an, ahistorical, position., Frank, Cioffi,, one, of, the, original, writers, who, wrote, a, forceful, reply, to, Wimsatt, and, Beardsley,, aligned, himself, with, neither, camp,, believing, different, cases, were, “best, read”, sometimes, just, as,, sometimes, other, than, as,, the, artist, knowingly, intended, them., One, reason, he, rejected, intention,, at, times,, was, because, he, believed, the, artist, might, be, unconscious, of, the, full, significance, of, the, artwork., A, similar, debate, arises, in, other, art, forms, besides, Literature,, for, instance, Architecture,, Theater,, and, Music,, although, it, has, caused, less, professional, comment, in, these, arts,, occurring, more, at, the, practical, level, in, terms, of, argument, between, “purists”, and, “modernizers.”, Purists, want, to, maintain, a, historical, orientation, to, these, art, forms,, while, modernizers, want, to, make, things, more, available, for, contemporary, use., The, debate, also, has, a, more, practical, aspect, in, connection, with, the, visual, arts., For, it, arises, in, the, question, of, what, devalues, fakes, and, forgeries,, and, by, contrast, puts, a, special, value, on, originality., There, have, been, several, notable, frauds, perpetrated, by, forgers, of, artworks, and, their, associates., The, question, is:, if, the, surface, appearance, is, much, the, same,, what, especial, value, is, there, in, the, first, object?, Nelson, Goodman, was, inclined, to, think, that, one, can, always, locate, a, sufficient, difference, by, looking, closely, at, the, visual, appearance., But, even, if, one, cannot,, there, remain, the, different, histories, of, the, original, and, the, copy,, and, also, the, different, intentions, behind, them., The, relevance, of, such, intentions, in, visual, art, has, entered, very, prominently, into, philosophical, discussion., Arthur, Danto,, in, his, 1964, discussion, of, “The, Artworld,”, was, concerned, with, the, question, of, how, the, atmosphere, of, theory, can, alter, how, we, see, artworks., This, situation, has, arisen, in, fact, with, respect, to, two, notable, paintings, which, look, the, same,, as, Timothy, Binkley, has, explained,, namely, Leonardo’s, original, “Mona, Lisa”, and, Duchamp’s, joke, about, it,, called, “L.H.O.O.Q., Shaved.”, The, two, works, look, ostensibly, the, same,, but, Duchamp,, one, needs, to, know,, had, also, produced, a, third, work,, “L.H.O.O.Q.,”, which, was, a, reproduction, of, the, "Mona, Lisa,", with, some, graffiti, on, it:, a, goatee, and, moustache., He, was, alluding, in, that, work, to, the, possibility, that, the, sitter, for, the, "Mona, Lisa", might, have, been, a, young, male,, given, the, stories, about, Leonardo’s, homosexuality., With, the, graffiti, removed, the, otherwise, visually, similar, works, are, still, different,, since, Duchamp’s, title,, and, the, history, of, its, production,, alters, what, we, think, about, his, piece., 6., Definitions, of, Art, Up, to, the, “de-definition”, period,, definitions, of, art, fell, broadly, into, three, types,, relating, to, representation,, expression,, and, form., The, dominance, of, representation, as, a, central, concept, in, art, lasted, from, before, Plato’s, time, to, around, the, end, of, the, eighteenth, century., Of, course,, representational, art, is, still, to, be, found, to, this, day,, but, it, is, no, longer, pre-eminent, in, the, way, it, once, was., Plato, first, formulated, the, idea, by, saying, that, art, is, mimesis,, and,, for, instance,, Bateaux, in, the, eighteenth, century, followed, him,, when, saying:, “Poetry, exists, only, by, imitation., It, is, the, same, thing, with, painting,, dance, and, music;, nothing, is, real, in, their, works,, everything, is, imagined,, painted,, copied,, artificial., It, is, what, makes, their, essential, character, as, opposed, to, nature.”, In, the, same, century, and, the, following, one,, with, the, advent, of, Romanticism,, the, concept, of, expression, became, more, prominent., Even, around, Plato’s, time,, his, pupil, Aristotle, preferred, an, expression, theory:, art, as, catharsis, of, the, emotions., And, Burke,, Hutcheson,, and, Hume, also, promoted, the, idea, that, what, was, crucial, in, art, were, audience, responses:, pleasure, in, Art, was, a, matter, of, taste, and, sentiment., But, the, full, flowering, of, the, theory, of, Expression,, in, the, twentieth, century,, has, shown, that, this, is, only, one, side, of, the, picture., In, the, taxonomy, of, art, terms, Scruton, provided,, Response, theories, concentrate, on, affective, qualities, such, as, “moving,”, “exciting,”, “nauseous,”, “tedious,”, and, so, forth., But, theories, of, art, may, be, called, “expression, theories”, even, though, they, focus, on, the, embodied,, emotional,, and, mental, qualities, discussed, before,, like, “joyful,”, “melancholy,”, “humble,”, “vulgar,”, and, “intelligent.”, As, we, shall, see, below,, when, recent, studies, of, expression, are, covered, in, more, detail,, it, has, been, writers, like, John, Hospers, and, O.K., Bouwsma, who, have, preferred, such, theories., But, there, are, other, types, of, theory, which, might,, even, more, appropriately,, be, called, “expression, theories.”, What, an, artist, is, personally, expressing, is, the, focus, of, self-expression, theories, of, art,, but, more, universal, themes, are, often, expressed, by, individuals,, and, art-historical, theories, see, the, artist, as, merely, the, channel, for, broader, social, concerns., R., G., Collingwood, in, the, 1930s, took, art, to, be, a, matter, of, self-expression:, “By, creating, for, ourselves, an, imaginary, experience, or, activity,, we, express, our, emotions;, and, this, is, what, we, call, art.”, And, the, noteworthy, feature, of, Marx’s, theory, of, art,, in, the, nineteenth, century,, and, those, of, the, many, different, Marxists, who, followed, him, into, the, twentieth, century,, was, that, they, were, expression, theories, in, the, “art-Historical”, sense., The, arts, were, taken,, by, people, of, this, persuasion,, to, be, part, of, the, superstructure, of, society,, whose, forms, were, determined, by, the, economic, base,, and, so, art, came, to, be, seen, as, expressing,, or, “reflecting”, those, material, conditions., Social, theories, of, art,, however,, need, not, be, based, on, materialism., One, of, the, major, social, theorists, of, the, late, nineteenth, century, was, the, novelist, Leo, Tolstoy,, who, had, a, more, spiritual, point, of, view., He, said:, “Art, is, a, human, activity, consisting, in, this,, that, one, man, consciously,, by, means, of, certain, external, signs,, hands, on, to, others, feelings, he, has, lived, through,, and, that, others, are, infected, by, these, feelings, and, also, experience, them.”, Coming, into, the, twentieth, century,, the, main, focus, shifted, towards, abstraction, and, the, appreciation, of, form., The, aesthetic,, and, the, arts, and, crafts, movements,, in, the, latter, part, of, the, nineteenth, century, drew, people, towards, the, appropriate, qualities., The, central, concepts, in, aesthetics, are, here, the, pure, aesthetic, ones, mentioned, before,, like, “graceful,”, “elegant,”, “exquisite,”, “glorious,”, and, “nice.”, But, formalist, qualities,, such, as, organization,, unity,, and, harmony,, as, well, as, variety, and, complexity,, are, closely, related,, as, are, technical, judgments, like, “well-made,”, “skilful,”, and, “professionally, written.”, The, latter, might, be, separated, out, as, the, focus, of, Craft, theories, of, art,, as, in, the, idea, of, art, as, “Techne”, in, ancient, Greece,, but, Formalist, theories, commonly, focus, on, all, of, these, qualities,, and, “aesthetes”, generally, find, them, all, of, central, concern., Eduard, Hanslick, was, a, major, late, nineteenth, century, musical, formalist;, the, Russian, Formalists, in, the, early, years, of, the, revolution,, and, the, French, Structuralists, later,, promoted, the, same, interest, in, Literature., Clive, Bell, and, Roger, Fry,, members, of, the, influential, Bloomsbury, Group, in, the, first, decades, of, the, twentieth, century,, were, the, most, noted, early, promoters, of, this, aspect, of, Visual, art., Bell’s, famous, “Aesthetic, Hypothesis”, was:, “What, quality, is, shared, by, all, objects, that, provoke, our, aesthetic, emotions?, Only, one, answer, seems, possible—, significant, form., In, each,, lines, and, colors, combined, in, a, particular, way;, certain, forms, and, relations, of, forms,, stir, our, aesthetic, emotions., These, relations, and, combinations, of, lines, and, colors,, these, aesthetically, moving, forms,, I, call, ‘Significant, Form’;, and, ‘Significant, Form’, is, the, one, quality, common, to, all, works, of, visual, art.”, Clement, Greenberg,, in, the, years, of, the, Abstract, Expressionists,, from, the, 1940s, to, the, 1970s,, also, defended, a, version, of, this, Formalism., Abstraction, was, a, major, drive, in, early, twentieth, century, art,, but, the, later, decades, largely, abandoned, the, idea, of, any, tight, definition, of, art., The, “de-definition”, of, art, was, formulated, in, academic, philosophy, by, Morris, Weitz,, who, derived, his, views, from, some, work, of, Wittgenstein, on, the, notion, of, games., Wittgenstein, claimed, that, there, is, nothing, which, all, games, have, in, common,, and, so, the, historical, development, of, them, has, come, about, through, an, analogical, process, of, generation,, from, paradigmatic, examples, merely, by, way, of, “family, resemblances.”, There, are,, however,, ways, of, providing, a, kind, of, definition, of, art, which, respects, its, open, texture., The, Institutional, definition, of, art,, formulated, by, George, Dickie,, is, in, this, class:, “a, work, of, art, is, an, artefact, which, has, had, conferred, upon, it, the, status, of, candidate, for, appreciation, by, the, artworld.”, This, leaves, the, content, of, art, open,, since, it, is, left, up, to, museum, directors,, festival, organizers,, and, so, forth,, to, decide, what, is, presented., Also,, as, we, saw, before,, Dickie, left, the, notion, of, “appreciation”, open,, since, he, allowed, that, all, aspects, of, a, work, of, art, could, be, attended, to, aesthetically., But, the, notion, of, “artefact,”, too,, in, this, definition, is, not, as, restricted, as, it, might, seem,, since, anything, brought, into, an, art, space, as, a, candidate, for, appreciation, becomes, thereby, “artefactualized,”, according, to, Dickie—, and, so, he, allowed, as, art, what, are, otherwise, called, (natural), "Found, Objects,", and, (previously, manufactured), "Readymades.", Less, emphasis, on, power, brokers, was, found, in, Monroe, Beardsley’s, slightly, earlier, aesthetic, definition, of, art:, “an, artwork, is, something, produced, with, the, intention, of, giving, it, the, capacity, to, satisfy, the, aesthetic, interest”—, where, “production”, and, “aesthetic”, have, their, normal,, restricted, content., But, this, suggests, that, these, two, contemporary, definitions,, like, the, others,, merely, reflect, the, historical, way, that, art, developed, in, the, associated, period., Certainly, traditional, objective, aesthetic, standards,, in, the, earlier, twentieth, century,, have, largely, given, way, to, free, choices, in, all, manner, of, things, by, the, mandarins, of, the, public, art, world, more, recently., 7., Expression, Response, theories, of, art, were, particularly, popular, during, the, Logical, Positivist, period, in, philosophy,, that, is,, around, the, 1920s, and, 1930s., Science, was, then, contrasted, sharply, with, Poetry,, for, instance,, the, former, being, supposedly, concerned, with, our, rational, mind,, the, latter, with, our, irrational, emotions., Thus, the, noted, English, critic, I., A., Richards, tested, responses, to, poems, scientifically, in, an, attempt, to, judge, their, value,, and, unsurprisingly, found, no, uniformity., Out, of, this, kind, of, study, comes, the, common, idea, that, “art, is, all, subjective”:, if, one, concentrates, on, whether, people, do, or, do, not, like, a, particular, work, of, art, then,, naturally,, there, can, easily, seem, to, be, no, reason, to, it., We, are, now, more, used, to, thinking, that, the, emotions, are, rational,, partly, because, we, now, distinguish, the, cause, of, an, emotion, from, its, target., If, one, looks, at, what, emotions, are, caused, by, an, artwork,, not, all, of, these, need, target, the, artwork, itself,, but, instead, what, is, merely, associated, with, it., So, what, the, subjective, approach, centrally, overlooks, are, questions, to, do, with, attention,, relevance,, and, understanding., With, those, as, controlling, features, we, get, a, basis, for, normalizing, the, expected, audience’s, emotions, in, connection, with, the, artwork,, and, so, move, away, from, purely, personal, judgments, such, as, “Well,, it, saddened, me”, to, more, universal, assessments, like, “it, was, sad.”, And, with, the, “it”, more, focused, on, the, artwork, we, also, start, to, see, the, significance, of, the, objective, emotional, features, it, metaphorically, possesses,, which, were, what, Embodiment, theorists, like, Hospers, settled, on, as, central., Hospers,, following, Bouwsma,, claimed, that, the, sadness, of, some, music,, for, instance,, concerns, not, what, is, evoked, in, us,, nor, any, feeling, experienced, by, the, composer,, but, simply, its, physiognomic, similarity, to, humans, when, sad:, “it, will, be, slow, not, tripping;, it, will, be, low, not, tinkling., People, who, are, sad, move, more, slowly,, and, when, they, speak, they, speak, softly, and, low.”, This, was, also, a, point, of, view, developed, at, length, by, the, gestalt, psychologist, Rudolph, Arnheim., The, discriminations, do, not, stop, there,, however., Guy, Sircello,, against, Hospers,, pointed, out, first, that, there, are, two, ways, emotions, may, be, embodied, in, artworks:, because, of, their, form, (which, is, what, Hospers, chiefly, had, in, mind),, and, because, of, their, content., Thus,, a, picture, may, be, sad, not, because, of, its, mood, or, color,, but, because, its, subject, matter, or, topic, is, pathetic, or, miserable., That, point, was, only, a, prelude,, however,, to, an, even, more, radical, criticism, of, Embodiment, theories, by, Sircello., For, emotion, words, can, also, be, applied,, he, said,, on, account, of, the, “artistic, acts”, performed, by, the, artists, in, presenting, their, attitude, to, their, subject., If, we, look, upon, an, artwork, from, this, perspective,, we, are, seeing, it, as, a, “symptom”, in, Suzanne, Langer’s, terms;, however,, Langer, believed, one, should, see, it, as, a, “symbol”, holding, some, meaning, which, can, be, communicated, to, others., Communication, theorists, all, combine, the, three, elements, above,, namely, the, audience,, the, artwork,, and, the, artist,, but, they, come, in, a, variety, of, stamps., Thus,, while, Clive, Bell, and, Roger, Fry, were, Formalists,, they, were, also, Communication, Theorists., They, supposed, that, an, artwork, transmitted, “aesthetic, emotion”, from, the, artist, to, the, audience, on, account, of, its, “significant, form.”, Leo, Tolstoi, was, also, a, communication, theorist, but, of, almost, the, opposite, sort., What, had, to, be, transmitted,, for, Tolstoi,, was, expressly, what, was, excluded, by, Bell, and, (to, a, lesser, extent), Fry,, namely, the, “emotions, of, life.”, Tolstoi, wanted, art, to, serve, a, moral, purpose:, helping, to, bind, communities, together, in, their, fellowship, and, common, humanity, under, God., Bell, and, Fry, saw, no, such, social, purpose, in, art,, and, related, to, this, difference, were, their, opposing, views, regarding, the, value, of, aesthetic, properties, and, pleasure., These, were, anathema, to, Tolstoi,, who,, like, Plato,, thought, they, led, to, waste;, but, the, “exalted”, feelings, coming, from, the, appreciation, of, pure, form, were, celebrated, by, Bell, and, Fry,, since, their, “metaphysical, hypothesis”, claimed, it, put, one, in, touch, with, “ultimate, reality.”, Bell, said,, “What, is, that, which, is, left, when, we, have, stripped, a, thing, of, all, sensations,, of, all, its, significance, as, a, means?, What, but, that, which, philosophers, used, to, call, ‘the, thing, in, itself’, and, now, call, ‘ultimate, reality’.”, This, debate, between, moralists, and, aesthetes, continues, to, this, day, with,, for, instance,, Noël, Carroll, supporting, a, “Moderate, Moralism”, while, Anderson, and, Dean, support, “Moderate, Autonomism.”, Autonomism, wants, aesthetic, value, to, be, isolated, from, ethical, value,, whereas, Moralism, sees, them, as, more, intimately, related., Communication, theorists, generally, compare, art, to, a, form, of, Language., Langer, was, less, interested, than, the, above, theorists, in, legislating, what, may, be, communicated,, and, was, instead, concerned, to, discriminate, different, art, languages,, and, the, differences, between, art, languages, generally, and, verbal, languages., She, said,, in, brief,, that, art, conveyed, emotions, of, various, kinds,, while, verbal, language, conveyed, thoughts,, which, was, a, point, made, by, Tolstoy, too., But, Langer, spelled, out, the, matter, in, far, finer, detail., Thus,, she, held, that, art, languages, were, “presentational”, forms, of, expression,, while, verbal, languages, were, “discursive”—, with, Poetry,, an, art, form, using, verbal, language,, combining, both, aspects,, of, course., Somewhat, like, Hospers, and, Bouwsma,, Langer, said, that, art, forms, presented, feelings, because, they, were, “morphologically, similar”, to, them:, an, artwork,, she, held,, shared, the, same, form, as, the, feeling, it, symbolizes., This, gave, rise, to, the, main, differences, between, presentational, and, discursive, modes, of, communication:, verbal, languages, had, a, vocabulary,, a, syntax,, determinate, meanings,, and, the, possibility, of, translation,, but, none, of, these, were, guaranteed, for, art, languages,, according, to, Langer., Art, languages, revealed, “what, it, is, like”, to, experience, something—, they, created, “virtual, experiences.”, The, detailed, ways, in, which, this, arises, with, different, art, forms, Langer, explained, in, her, 1953, book, Feeling, and, Form., Scruton, followed, Langer, in, several, ways,, notably, by, remarking, that, the, experience, of, each, art, form, is, sui, generis,, that, is,, “each, of, its, own, kind.”, He, also, spelled, out, the, characteristics, of, a, symbol, in, even, more, detail., Discussions, of, questions, specific, to, each, art, form, have, been, pursued, by, many, other, writers;, see,, for, instance,, Dickie,, Sclafani,, and, Roblin,, and, the, recent, book, by, Gordon, Graham., 8., Representation, Like, the, concept, of, Expression,, the, concept, of, Representation, has, been, very, thoroughly, examined, since, the, professionalization, of, Philosophy, in, the, twentieth, century., Isn’t, representation, just, a, matter, of, copying?, If, representation, could, be, understood, simply, in, terms, of, copying,, that, would, require, “the, innocent, eye,”, that, is,, one, which, did, not, incorporate, any, interpretation., E., H., Gombrich, was, the, first, to, point, out, that, modes, of, representation, are,, by, contrast,, conventional,, and, therefore, have, a, cultural,, socio-historical, base., Thus, perspective,, which, one, might, view, as, merely, mechanical,, is, only, a, recent, way, of, representing, space,, and, many, photographs, distort, what, we, take, to, be, reality—, for, instance,, those, from, the, ground, of, tall, buildings,, which, seem, to, make, them, incline, inwards, at, the, top., Goodman,, too,, recognized, that, depiction, was, conventional;, he, likened, it, to, denotation,, that, is,, the, relation, between, a, word, and, what, it, stands, for., He, also, gave, a, more, conclusive, argument, against, copying, being, the, basis, of, representation., For, that, would, make, resemblance, a, type, of, representation,, whereas, if, a, resembles, b,, then, b, resembles, a—, yet, a, dog, does, not, represent, its, picture., In, other, words,, Goodman, is, saying, that, resemblance, implies, a, symmetric, relationship,, but, representation, does, not., As, a, result,, Goodman, made, the, point, that, representation, is, not, a, craft, but, an, art:, we, create, pictures, of, things,, achieving, a, view, of, those, things, by, representing, them, as, this, or, as, that., As, a, result,, while, one, sees, the, objects, depicted,, the, artist’s, thoughts, about, those, objects, may, also, be, discerned,, as, with, Sircello’s, “artistic, arts.”, The, plain, idea, that, just, objects, are, represented, in, a, picture, was, behind, Richard, Wollheim’s, account, of, representational, art, in, the, first, edition, of, his, book Art, and, Its, Objects, (1968)., There,, the, paint, in, a, picture, was, said, to, be, “seen, as”, an, object., But, in, the, book’s, second, edition,, Wollheim, augmented, this, account, to, allow, for, what, is, also, “seen, in”, the, work,, which, includes, such, things, as, the, thoughts, of, the, artist., There, are, philosophical, questions, of, another, kind,, however,, with, respect, to, the, representation, of, objects,, because, of, the, problematic, nature, of, fictions., There, are, three, broad, categories, of, object, which, might, be, represented:, individuals, which, exist,, like, Napoleon;, types, of, thing, which, exist,, like, kangaroos;, and, things, which, do, not, exist,, like, Mr., Pickwick,, and, unicorns., Goodman’s, account, of, representation, easily, allowed, for, the, first, two, categories,, since,, if, depictions, are, like, names,, the, first, two, categories, of, painting, compare,, respectively,, with, the, relations, between, the, proper, name, “Napoleon”, and, the, person, Napoleon,, and, the, common, name, “kangaroo”, and, the, various, kangaroos., Some, philosophers, would, think, that, the, third, category, was, as, easily, accommodated,, but, Goodman,, being, an, Empiricist, (and, so, concerned, with, the, extensional, world),, was, only, prepared, to, countenance, existent, objects., So, for, him, pictures, of, fictions, did, not, denote, or, represent, anything;, instead,, they, were, just, patterns, of, various, sorts., Pictures, of, unicorns, were, just, shapes,, for, Goodman,, which, meant, that, he, saw, the, description, “picture, of, a, unicorn”, as, unarticulated, into, parts., What, he, preferred, to, call, a, “unicorn-picture”, was, merely, a, design, with, certain, named, shapes, within, it., One, needs, to, allow, there, are, “intensional”, objects, as, well, as, extensional, ones, before, one, can, construe, “picture, of, a, unicorn’, as, parallel, to, “picture, of, a, kangaroo.”, By, contrast, with, Goodman,, Scruton, is, one, philosopher, more, happy, with, this, kind, of, construal., It, is, a, construal, generally, more, congenial, to, Idealists,, and, to, Realists, of, various, persuasions,, than, to, Empiricists., The, contrast, between, Empiricists, and, other, types, of, philosopher, also, bears, on, other, central, matters, to, do, with, fictions., Is, a, fictional, story, a, lie, about, this, world,, or, a, truth, about, some, other?, Only, if, one, believes, there, are, other, worlds,, in, some, kind, of, way,, will, one, be, able, to, see, much, beyond, untruths, in, stories., A, Realist, will, settle, for, there, being, “fictional, characters,”, often, enough,, about, which, we, know, there, are, some, determinate, truths—, wasn’t, Mr., Pickwick, fat?, But, one, difficulty, then, is, knowing, things, about, Mr., Pickwick, other, than, what, Dickens, tells, us—, was, Mr., Pickwick, fond, of, grapes,, for, instance?, An, Idealist, will, be, more, prepared, to, consider, fictions, as, just, creatures, of, our, imaginations., This, style, of, analysis, has, been, particularly, prominent, recently,, with, Scruton, essaying, a, general, theory, of, the, imagination, in, which, statements, like, “Mr., Pickwick, was, fat”, are, entertained, in, an, “unasserted”, fashion., One, problem, with, this, style, of, analysis, is, explaining, how, we, can, have, emotional, relations, with,, and, responses, to,, fictional, entities., We, noticed, this, kind, of, problem, before,, in, Burke’s, description, “delightful, horror”:, how, can, audiences, get, pleasure, from, tragedies, and, horror, stories, when,, if, those, same, events, were, encountered, in, real, life,, they, would, surely, be, anything, but, pleasurable?, On, the, other, hand,, unless, we, believe, that, fictions, are, real,, how, can, we,, for, instance,, be, moved, by, the, fate, of, Anna, Karenina?, Colin, Radford,, in, 1975,, wrote, a, celebrated, paper, on, this, matter, which, concluded, that, the, “paradox, of, emotional, response, to, fiction”, was, unsolvable:, adult, emotional, responses, to, fictions, were, “brute, facts,”, but, they, were, still, incoherent, and, irrational,, he, said., Radford, defended, this, conclusion, in, a, series, of, further, papers, in, what, became, an, extensive, debate., Kendall, Walton,, in, his, 1990, book, Mimesis, and, Make-Believe,, pursued, at, length, an, Idealist’s, answer, to, Radford., At, a, play,, for, instance,, Walton, said, the, audience, enters, into, a, form, of, pretence, with, the, actors,, not, believing,, but, making, believe, that, the, portrayed, events, and, emotions, are, real., 9., Art, Objects, What, kind, of, thing, is, a, work, of, art?, Goodman,, Wollheim,, Wolterstorff,, and, Margolis, have, been, notable, contributors, to, the, contemporary, debate., We, must, first, distinguish, the, artwork, from, its, notation, or, “recipe,”, and, from, its, various, physical, realizations., Examples, would, be:, some, music,, its, score,, and, its, performances;, a, drama,, its, script,, and, its, performances;, an, etching,, its, plate,, and, its, prints;, and, a, photograph,, its, negative,, and, its, positives., The, notations, here, are, “digital”, in, the, first, two, cases,, and, “analogue”, in, the, second, two,, since, they, involve, discrete, elements, like, notes, and, words, in, the, one, case,, and, continuous, elements, like, lines, and, color, patches, in, the, other., Realizations, can, also, be, divided, into, two, broad, types,, as, these, same, examples, illustrate:, there, are, those, that, arise, in, time, (performance, works), and, those, that, arise, in, space, (object, works)., Realizations, are, always, physical, entities., Sometimes, there, is, only, one, realization,, as, with, architect-designed, houses,, couturier-designed, dresses,, and, many, paintings,, and, Wollheim, concluded, that, in, these, cases, the, artwork, is, entirely, physical,, consisting, of, that, one,, unique, realization., However,, a, number, a, copies, were, commonly, made, of, paintings, in, the, middle, ages,, and, it, is, theoretically, possible, to, replicate, even, expensive, clothing, and, houses., Philosophical, questions, in, this, area, arise, mainly, with, respect, to, the, ontological, status, of, the, idea, which, gets, executed., Wollheim, brought, in, Charles, Peirce’s, distinction, between, types, and, tokens,, as, an, answer, to, this:, the, number, of, different, tokens, of, letters, (7),, and, different, types, of, letter, (5),, in, the, string, “ABACDEC,”, indicates, the, difference., Realizations, are, tokens,, but, ideas, are, types,, that, is,, categories, of, objects., There, is, a, normative, connection, between, them, as, Margolis, and, Nicholas, Wolterstorff, have, explained,, since, the, execution, of, ideas, is, an, essentially, social, enterprise., That, also, explains, how, the, need, for, a, notation, arises:, one, which, would, link, not, only, the, idea, with, its, execution,, but, also, the, various, functionaries., Broadly,, there, are, the, creative, persons, who, generate, the, ideas,, which, are, transmitted, by, means, of, a, recipe, to, manufacturers, who, generate, the, material, objects, and, performances., “Types, are, created,, particulars, are, made”, it, has, been, said,, but, the, link, is, through, the, recipe., Schematically,, two, main, figures, are, associated, with, the, production, of, many, artworks:, the, architect, and, the, builder,, the, couturier, and, the, dressmaker,, the, composer, and, the, performer,, the, choreographer, and, the, dancer,, the, script-writer, and, the, actor,, and, so, forth., But, a, much, fuller, list, of, operatives, is, usually, involved,, as, is, very, evident, with, the, production, of, films,, and, other, similar, large, entertainments., Sometimes, the, director, of, a, film, is, concerned, to, control, all, its, aspects,, when, we, get, the, notion, of, an, “auteur”, who, can, be, said, to, be, the, author, of, the, work,, but, normally,, creativity, and, craft, thread, through, the, whole, production, process,, since, even, those, designated, “originators”, still, work, within, certain, traditions,, and, no, recipe, can, limit, entirely, the, end, product., The, associated, philosophical, question, concerns, the, nature, of, any, creativity., There, is, not, much, mystery, about, the, making, of, particulars, from, some, recipe,, but, much, more, needs, to, be, said, about, the, process, of, originating, some, new, idea., For, creation, is, not, just, a, matter, of, getting, into, an, excited, mental, state—, as, in, a, “brainstorming”, session,, for, instance., That, is, a, central, part, of, the, “creative, process, theory,”, a, form, of, which, is, to, be, found, in, the, work, of, Collingwood., It, was, in, these, terms, that, Collingwood, distinguished, the, artist, from, the, craftsperson,, namely, with, reference, to, what, the, artist, was, capable, of, generating, just, in, his, or, her, mind., But, the, major, difficulty, with, this, kind, of, theory, is, that, any, novelty, has, to, be, judged, externally, in, terms, of, the, artist’s, social, place, amongst, other, workers, in, the, field,, as, Jack, Glickman, has, shown., Certainly,, if, it, is, to, be, an, original, idea,, the, artist, cannot, know, beforehand, what, the, outcome, of, the, creative, process, will, be., But, others, might, have, had, the, same, idea, before,, and, if, the, outcome, was, known, already,, then, the, idea, thought, up, was, not, original, in, the, appropriate, sense., Thus, the, artist, will, not, be, credited, with, ownership, in, such, cases., Creation, is, not, a, process,, but, a, public, achievement:, it, is, a, matter, of, breaking, the, tape, ahead, of, others, in, a, certain, race., 10., References, and, Further, Reading, Arnheim,, R.1954, Art, and, Visual, Perception., University,
