[Welcome, to, Mini, Mogul, Enterprises, (MME),, home, of, Movie, Pubs, and, the, Lee, Garmes, Cinema, Institute., MME, functions, as, Matrixx, Entertainment's, quality, assurance, and, human, resources, division, by, providing, training, and, reference, materials, for, employees, and, entrepreneurs, through, the, Entertainment, Orientation, Course, and, Movie, Franchise, Programs,, respectively., The, Entertainment, Orientation, Course, The, Entertainment, Orientation, Course, (the, "EOC"), consists, of, 9, administrative, courses, (for, executives, and, staff), and, 15, technical, courses, (for, talent, and, crew), which, are, done, on, the, premises, of, the, Company, or, over, the, Internet, through, the, Lee, Garmes, Cinema, Institute., Serious, students, of, film, (who, have, learned, the, basics, of, writing, and, filmmaking,, before, or, after, going, to, film, school),, who, want, to, develop, their, movie, careers,, can, greatly, benefit, by, the, EOC,, and, perhaps, shave, years, off, their, ascent, to, directing, and, producing, features, by, setting, up, their, own, production, "franchise.", Mini, Mogul, Productions, As, part, of, our, program,, Mini, Mogul, Enterprises, provides, administrative,, technical, and, legal, support, for, those, who, license, The, Movie, Mogul, Manual, and, establish, their, own, feature, film, production, "franchise", or, for, those, who, opt, to, begin, with, student, and, semi-professional, "Mini, Mogul, Productions", as, forth, in, the, The, Mini, Mogul, Manual., Although, MME, does, not, establish, franchises, in, the, legal, sense, of, the, word, (because, there, is, no, use, of, trademarks, nor, is, the, technical, and, administrative, help, mandatory),, this, concept, of, licensing, support, and, setting, up, production, companies, is, being, piloted, by, Matrixx, Entertainment, as, a, possible, new, studio, system, which, may, be, able, to, provide, greater, opportunity, for, those, wishing, to, become, involved, in, the, movie, business, with, less, risk., Starting, with, the, materials, found, in, The, Mini, Mogul, Manual,, licensees, progress, through, a, series, of, shoots, that, are, designed, to, increase, skills, and, result, in, specific, demo, reels,, the, goal, being, to, eventually, arrive, at, viable, feature, motion, pictures,, beginning, with, 1-Day, Shoots,, and, proceeding, onto, 2-3, Day, Shoots,, a, 6-Day, Shoot, (Mini, Mogul, Productions), and, ultimately, onto, the, full, Feature, Film, Shoot, of, 18, or, more, days, (Movie, Mogul, Productions)., By, training, new, producers, in, this, fashion,, the, Company, plans, on, creating, a, matrix, for, economically, produced, future, film, product., Pursuant, to, the, Movie, Company, Licensing, Agreement,, the, Company, owns, equity, in, each, of, these, "franchise", productions, in, consideration, for, providing, on-going, consulting, and, support., Admin, and, Tech, Support, The, "franchise", program, provides, signatories, with, access, to, state-of-the-art, technical,, administrative, and, legal, know-how, from, its, founders,, outside, consultants, and, executives, in, the, entertainment, industry, and, other, related, industries., Confidential, trade, secret, aspects, of, the, licensable, materials, provided, by, MME, ensure, that, the, Company, is, able, to, direct, the, administrative, and, technical, knowledge-base, to, signatory, companies, and, not, competitors., The, nature, of, this, program, also, makes, it, possible, for, a, wider, range, of, financing, possibilities, with, minimal, capital-entry, costs, and, a, safer, learning, curve., The, Company, retains, the, right,, but, not, the, obligation,, to, receive, two, screen, credits, on, each, motion, picture, produced, by, a, franchise, production, during, the, term, of, the, licensing, agreement., The, first, screen, credit, is, to, recognize, that, individual, who, provided, the, most, help, and, support, on, a, given, project, and, second, screen, credit, is, to, recognize, Matrixx, Entertainment's, contribution, in, general., As, this, program, matures, it, provides, a, growing, source, of, symbiotic, relationships, and, on-going, film, product, which, the, Company, intends, to, distribute, through, its, on-line, distribution, network, under, a, new, paradigm, of, recoupment, and, gross, profit, participation., Initial, Franchise, Companies, Under, the, banners, of, its, first, pilot, franchise, companies,, SILVERTHORNE-MATRIXX, PRODUCTIONS,, DEEP, LAKE, PICTURES, and, LION, LAMB, PRODUCTIONS,, the, Company, has, completed, a, number, of, Mini, Mogul, Productions, entitled:, RETURN,, THE, PICKUP,, RESERVOIR, ZOMBIES,, GEORGE, and, IF, YOU, CAN, KEEP, IT., THE, PICKUP, was, the, first, film, in, history, to, utilize, personal, computers, for, script, breakdown, and, production, scheduling., Movie, Mogul, Productions, DEEP, LAKE, PICTURES, is, continuing, its, operations, in, West, Chester,, Pennsylvania, and, has, several, projects, in, various, stages, of, development., It, is, the, Company's, goal, to, license, a, number, of, new, franchise, companies, in, the, next, several, years., By, retaining, a, modest, interest, in, each, franchise, (between, 1, and, 5, percent),, this, new, "studio-system", is, enabling, MME, to, establish, and, promote, numerous,, semi-autonomous, production, entities,, any, one, (or, many), of, which, could, produce, the, next, important, features, allowing, the, Company, to, participate, in, gross, revenues, which, may, be, significant, over, the, long-term., Each, one, of, the, Franchise, Production, Companies, also, participates, in, these, revenues, on, the, same, basis, as, Matrixx, Entertainment., In, addition, to, utilizing, known, personalities, as, appropriate,, the, Company, is, developing, its, own, talent, and, retaining, an, option, on, future, services., By, doing, this,, the, Company, hopes, to, bring, back, a, portion, of, the, "old, studio, system", which, was, less, ad, hoc, and, more, sympathetic, to, new, talent,, than, the, system, today., This, includes, helping, existing, "Stars", develop, careers, in, directing, and, producing, features,, through, the, production, company, franchise, program., Movie, Publications, One, of, Mini, Mogul, Enterprise's, most, important, functions, is, publishing, books,, manuals, and, Internet, courses, on, all, aspects, of, production, and, the, entertainment, industry., Find, out, more,
