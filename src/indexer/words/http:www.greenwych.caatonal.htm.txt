[ No., 196, Winter, 2004,     ,  Greenwich, Publ., Saskatoon,, Sask.  ,     FAX:, 306-244-0795, /, TEL:, 244-0679,         ISSN, 0704-6588,  ,  , "A-NATURAL", ATONALITY: , The, False, "Science", of, Modern, Atonal, Music,  , Atonality, is, a, musical, system, that, avoids, creating, a, feeling, of, key, or, tonality., This, feeling, can, best, be, described, as, a, sense, that, all, notes, in, a, melody, or, composition, "belong", to, each, other,, more, or, less,, and, also, gives, us, a, feeling, there, is, a, beginning,, middle, and, end, to, a, composition., But, the, invention, of, "atonality", is, designed, to, arrange, notes, so, that, these, feelings, are, avoided., Atonalist, theorists,, ever, since, modern, "atonal", music, began,, claim, this, is, possible, to, do, because, the, sense, of, key, we, feel, from, tonal, music, is, �just, something, socially, learned, by, habit, and, familiarity, --, we, "grew, up", with, tonal, music,, and, so, it, sounds, "right", to, us.', But, these, claims, are, contradicted, by, the, basics, of, physiology, and, acoustics., When, the, simplest, basics, of, these, sciences, are, accurately, understood,, then, we, find, that, tonality, or, a, sense, of, "key", is, founded, in, nature,, based, largely, on, what, we, call, "overtones", in, music., As, follows:,  , Whenever, a, single, note,, like, "Middle, C,", is, played,, we, actually, hear, several , notes, at, once,, called, "overtones.",  They're, very, faint,, and, even, though, we, think, we're, hearing, a, single, note, C,, we, still, hear, its, overtones:, The, overtones, are, a, mixture, of, different, weaker, tones, telling, us,, for, ex.,, we're, hearing, a, "C", by, a, trumpet, instead, of, a, piano, or, a, voice, --, but, sounding, like, the, same, "single", note, of, middle, C., The, higher, the, overtones, are,, the, less, loud, they, are., The, human, ear, can, only, hear, the, first, few, overtones, of, any, note, played., Except, for, a, tuning, fork,, all,  musical, notes, made, by, voices, or, instruments, will, produce, their, own, overtones., The, meaning, of, these, scientific, facts, ,, as, initially, outlined, in, my, books, on, the, origin, of, music,, appear, to, be, this:, The, basic, musical, scale, &, its, tonality, (meaning, a, scale, form, in, which, there, are, strong, and, weak, notes,, rather, than, all, notes, seeming, to, be, equally, important), probably, arose, in, the, most, ancient, times, like, this:,  , We, hear, the, octave, as, the, loudest, overtone, of, any, note,, such, as, middle, C., Next, loudest, [&, different], note, would, be, a, tone, matching, what, is, the, fifth, note, of, a, scale,, namely, the, "fifth.", In, the, scale, of, C,, this, would, be, G., The, note, that, produces, middle, C, as, its, audible, overtone, would, match, the, 4th, scale, note,, F., This, creates, what, is, now, called, the, tonic, (or, its, octave),, the, fifth,, and, the, fourth,, steps, (or, "intervals"), in, the, scale, when, they, are, played, out, loud, as, separate, notes., These, three, intervals, come, from, the, most, noticeable, of, the, overtones., The, tonic,, fourth, and, fifth, are, found, in, the, music, and, scales, of, all, cultures, in, all, periods, of, human, music, making., When, each, of, the, intervals, is, sounded, as, separate, notes,, they,, in, turn,, have, their, own, overtones., The, loudest, of, ALL, these, will, clue, in, the, rest, of, the, notes, found, in, the, most, widely, known, scales, in, the, world, and, in, history., This, also, explains, how, there, are, strong, &, weak, notes, in, the, scale,, why, there, are, only, 2, halftones, in, the, scale,, why, notes, historically, entered, the, scale, when, they, did...and, much, more., Here's, how:, If, you, write, out, the, overtones, of, these, three, intervals, and, string, out, the, three, most, audible, (different), overtones, of, each,, within, the, span, of, an, octave,, you, can, get, the, major, scale, (, I've, left, out, the, repeated, octave, overtones, and, inaudible, overtones, as, redundant):, TONIC, C:,    Overtones:, C,, G,, E,, (&, Bb,, then, inaudible), FIFTH, G:,     Overtones:, G,, D,, B,, (and, F), FOURTH, F:, Overtones:, F,, C,, A,, (and, Eb), Major, scale:,    C,, D,, E,, F,, G,, A,, B,, C, If, you, substitute, the, three, weakest, ones, (the, 3rd,, 6th, and, 7th, notes, of, the, scale), with, another, three, notes, (which, includes, the, even, weaker, next, overtones),, and, which, are, flatter,, you, get, the, minor, scale., (The, 6th, note, above, is, strongest, of, the, three, because, it, forms, no, halftones, with, adjacent, notes, in, the, major, scale):, Minor, scale:,    C,, D,, Eb,, F,, G,, Ab,, Bb,, C, Now,, if, you, leave, these, two, --, the, 3rd, and, 7th, notes, --, out, altogether,, you, get, what's, called, the, "Chinese, scale", --, or, the, piano's, "black, notes", pentatonic, 5-note, scale, --, found, also, in, Africa,, old, Scottish, and, Irish, folk, music,, and, elsewhere:, Pentatonic, scale:,   C,, D,   , F,, G,, A,   , C, Because, those, two, overtones, are, very, weak,, they, were, the, last, to, come, into, the, scale,, and, how, to, tune, them, was, a, matter, of, historic, uncertainty, --, and, many, people, tuned, them, somewhere, between, minor, and, major, (in, the, �cracks', on, the, piano),, producing, what, are, known, as, "blue", or, "neutral", notes., The, process, of, adding, halftones, into, the, pentatonic, scale, took, place, in, China,, in, Scottish, music,, elsewhere,, and, even, the, names, given, to, these, notes, in, different, cultures, are, similar:, "passing,", "becoming,", "leading", notes.,  , HARMONY,  , When, you, further, consider, the, advent, of, harmony, you'll, see, that, the, first, three, different, overtones, of, the, notes, shown, (or, of, any, note), add, up, to, that, note's, major, chord.,  There, has, been, use, of, mostly, the, three, chords, of, the, tonic,, dominant(5th), and, subdominant, (4th)), to, harmonize, all, the, 7, scale-notes, in, most, of, the, folk, melodies, known., This, further, underscores, that, these, three, universal, intervals, and, their, overtones, were, fundamental, semiconscious, influences, in, the, evolution, of, the, scale's, notes., Harmony, evolved, as, a, means, to, enhance, the, inner, overtone, relationships, between, scale, notes., Even, the, names, that, evolved, for, them, are, perfect, representations, of, their, acoustic, or, tonal, role,, even, though, the, names, ("dominant", "sub-dominant", &, "keynote, /, tonic"),  were, also, coined, by, people, without, acoustical, knowledge.,  , Now, either, all, this, is, the, greatest, coincidence, on, earth, --, that, is,, people, who, knew, nothing, of, acoustics, coming, up, with, scales, reflecting, all , these, acoustic, properties, purely, by, chance, --, or, else,, in, fact,, the, ear, was, already, able, to, discern, sounds, as, distinct, between, harmonious, or, dissonant, because, the, ear, could, hear, these, acoustic, properties, without, having, to, consciously, know, they, existed.,  , CONSONANCE, &, DISSONANCE,  , Any, octave, of, any, note, has, twice, the, vibrations, of, that, note,, and, therefore,, has, a, "ratio", of, 2, to, 1., A, fifth, also, has, a, simple, ratio, [3, to, 2],, as, does, the, fourth, [4, to, 3]., When, ratios, of, intervals, become, less, simple, or, more, complex,, then,, what, we, have, called, "musical",  in, history,, more, and, more, approaches, what, most, peoples, have, called, noise,  or, dissonance., If, we, play, C, and, F#,, for, example,, that, ratio, is, 17, to, 24,, and, has, rarely, (or, never), been, an, interval, found, in, any, widely, known, scale,, because, it, is, considered, dissonant,, whereas, the, C, and, F, interval, is, considered, consonant, with, its, 4, to, 3, ratio., Thus, the, appreciation, of, "dominant", consonant, notes, and, a, sense, of, "key", (tonality), does, NOT, arise, entirely, from, arbitrary, conditioning, nor, from, social, habit,, but, from, the, nature, of, sound, itself, and, the, nature, of, human, hearing., A, role, remained, for, using, dissonance, as, an, esthetic, duality, to, help, enhance, consonance.,  , EVOLUTIONARY, EFFECTS,  , General, human, evolution, has, provided, us, with, voices, that, are, acoustically, musical,, and, with, ear, receptors, that, are, appreciative, of,, or, attracted, to,, acoustically-musical, sounds, (i.e.,, not, noisy)., Why, this, evolution?, Without, these, physiological, capacities,, then:, *, Mothers, would, not, coo, to, their, babies;, nor, would, the, babies, love, the, sound, of, it;, *, Nor, would, evolution, of, language, and, the, socializing, sounds, of, the, voice, have, been, as, possible;, *, Nor, would, the, noisy, (i.e.,, not-acoustically, musical), sounds, from, any, nearby, destructive, event, or, attack,, or, of, the, sounds, of, breakage,, screams, or, cries, of, pain,, have, served, as, a, noisy, warning, [unattractive, or, repelling], to, alarm, or, alert, us, --, Some, sounds, make, us, come,, others, make, us, run...., And,, as, a, result,, our, collectivized, survival, might, not, have, been, as, efficient,, and, we, could,  have, gone, the, way, of, the, extinct, Dodo., All, those, same, capacities, [regarding, being, able, to, distinguish, noise, from, "musical", sound], also, served, to, allow, the, development, of, musical, systems, to, arise, and, evolve, wherever, there, were, curious, people, with, time, to, play, or, experiment, with, the, stimuli, around, them.,  , EVIDENCE, NOW, SUFFICIENT,  , The, subject, of, the, natural, basis, of, tonality, is, no,
