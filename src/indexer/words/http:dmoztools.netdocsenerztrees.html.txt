[DMOZ, Open, Directory, Project, Directory, About, DMOZ, Editing, Guidelines, Editor, Resources, Applying, for, Categories, Category, Checking, Preferred, Terms, Regional, Template, Robozilla, Reds, URL, Notes, Glossary, In, Other, Languages, DMOZ, Regional, Trees, Background, Regional, trees, are, a, new, feature, in, the, DMOZ, software., They, add, new, ways, of, navigating, the, Regional, structures, in, the, directory,, making, it, easier, to, find, specific, types, of, listings, within, a, broad, regional, structure., In, the, "classical", DMOZ, Regional, view,, each, listing, is, only, shown, in, the, particular, category, in, which, it, is, placed., Usually, this, is, a, locality-level, category,, but, sometimes, websites, are, placed, at, higher, levels, (e.g.,, at, County, or, Province, level), according, to, our, editing, guidelines., This, ensures, that, websites, are, treated, equitably,, and, establishes, a, much, needed, framework, within, which, editors, can, organize, sites., But, it's, not, always, easy, to, find, websites, by, navigating, the, classical, structure., When, they, can, be, used,, downward, @links, and, upward, relcat, links, help, to, find, sites, of, similar, topics, up, and, down, a, regional, structure., But, in, small, localities, with, few, listings,, the, regional, template, structure, is, not, or, only, sparsely, implemented,, so, that, their, listings, cannot, be, found, by, @links, from, higher-level, template, categories., Regional, trees, add, another, layer, of, information, to, our, Regional, listings,, which, allows, sites, to, be, found, according, to, their, topic, or, type, regardless, of, how, shallow, or, deep, the, template, structure, is, developed, in, their, locality., It, can, show, all, sites, of, a, particular, kind, throughout, a, regional, structure, on, one, page,, saving, a, lot, of, clicks., The, details, are, explained, in, the, sections, below., The, Public, Tree, View, Categories, that, are, part, of, a, defined, regional, tree, have, a, link, near, the, top, labeled, "Tree, View"., Clicking, this, link, switches, the, user, to, tree, navigation, mode., And, of, course,, clicking, the, "Classic, View", link, from, the, tree, view, switches, back, to, the, familiar, category, view., Tree, navigation, mode, is, governed, by, a, "path",, not, a, "category"., Just, like, in, classic, mode,, the, path, has, a, regional, part, (e.g., Regional/Europe/Netherlands/Zuid-Holland/Rotterdam), and, a, topical, part, (e.g.,, Recreation_and_Sports/Soccer)., But, while, classical, mode, only, recognizes, paths, that, correspond, exactly, to, existing, categories,, in, tree, mode, it, doesn't, matter, if, a, category, exists., The, combination, of, the, regional, part, and, the, topical, part, are, used, together, to, find, all, listings, in, that, regional, node, and, regional, nodes, below, it, classified, with, that, topic,, or, its, subtopics, For, example,, in, tree, mode, for, United_States/Alabama/Recreation_and_Sports,, you, may, find, listings, from, United_States/Alabama/Recreation_and_Sports, United_States/Alabama/Localities/Birmingham/Recreation_and_Sports, United_States/Alabama/Counties/Calhoun/Recreation_and_Sports/Baseball, You, may, also, find, a, listing, from, United_States/Alabama/Localities/Trafford, (no, topical, path),, because, this, listing, may, be, assigned, the, topic, Recreation_and_Sports/Soccer,, even, though, there, is, no, soccer, category, in, Trafford., If, there, are, more, than, 300, listings, that, could, be, listed, for, a, particular, path,, the, listings, belonging, to, deeper-level, categories, are, not, shown., Instead,, links, to, subtopics, and, deeper-level, regional, categories, are, shown, to, allow, you, to, narrow, down, your, selection., At, any, point, in, the, structure,, you, can, navigate, upward, regionally, by, clicking, the, "See, Also", links, to, higher-level, categories,, and, topically, by, clicking, a, link, in, the, path, breadcrumb, trail., What, Editors, Need, To, Know, So, how, does, this, all, work?, The, regional, tree, navigation, requires, an, extra, layer, of, information,, as, well, as, extra, housekeeping, to, keep, track, of, what, belongs, where., Most, of, this, happens, behind, the, scenes,, but, there, are, a, few, new, concepts, that, editors, in, Regional, Trees, need, to, be, aware, of., A, Tree, Needs, to, be, Created, Not, all, the, Regional, structures, belong, to, regional, trees., In, fact,, as, the, concept, is, relatively, new,, there, are, only, a, few, regional, trees, defined, at, this, time., Hopefully,, in, time,, they, will, cover, more, and, more, of, Regional, around, DMOZ., To, define, a, new, regional, tree,, you, need, to, work, with, an, admin, who, can, serve, as, tree, coordinator., Defining, a, tree, takes, several, steps., Defining, the, Regional, Structure, Regional, structures, in, DMOZ, come, in, many, different, forms:, countries, have, different, administrative, structures,, and, languages, use, different, words, to, describe, things, like, "Localities", and, "Regions"., A, collection, of, information, about, a, particular, structure,, called, a, Regional, Definition,, is, used, to, interpret, the, human-built, Regional, structure, of, DMOZ., Before, a, tree, can, be, set, up, in, a, particular, section, of, Regional,, the, corresponding, Regional, Definition, must, be, established., They, are, managed, from, the, Regional, Definition, Management, Form., All, editors, can, view, the, information, on, this, form,, but, only, admins, can, change, definitions,, or, add, new, ones., Defining, the, Topical, Structure, The, other, half, of, the, Regional, Tree, path, is, the, topical, part., This, is, much, like, the, Regional, Templates, that, have, been, in, place, for, a, long, time,, but, allows, for, more, fine-grained, classification, of, the, topic, of, a, site., For, example,, the, template, will, only, take, you, to, Society_and_Culture/Religion,, but, the, topical, template, can, take, you, deeper,, e.g., to, Society_and_Culture/Religion/Christianity/Orthodox., The, topical, structure, for, each, language, is, first, defined, by, importing, from, the, template, categories, in, Test,, but, can, then, be, further, expanded, using, the, Topical, Structure, Management, Form., As, with, regional, definitions,, this, form, can, be, viewed, by, all,, but, in, this, case, only, metas, and, admins, can, make, changes., It's, good, to, keep, track, of, which, topics, are, the, same, across, languages., For, example,, Onderwijs/Basisscholen, in, Dutch, is, the, same, topic, as, Education/K-12/Public/Elementary_Schools, in, US, English., To, make, sure, that, we, can, translate, the, topics, between, languages,, each, topical, structure, is, mapped, on, the, Master, Topical, Structure,, which, you, can, also, see, on, the, Topical, Structure, Management, Form., This, master, structure, is, a, grand, collection, of, all, the, topics, defined, in, all, the, language-specific, topical, structures., Specific, topical, structures, only, implement, the, parts, of, the, master, topical, structure, that, are, useful, in, that, language., Only, admins, can, change, the, master, topical, structure., Defining, the, Tree, With, all, necessary, Regional, and, Topical, machinery, in, place,, it, is, now, possible, to, define, a, new, Regional, Tree., Each, tree, has, a, Regional, Definition,, a, Topical, Structure,, and, a, language., It, also, needs, a, top-level, category,, and, can, optionally, define, the, next, two, regional, layers, above, the, tree., For, example,, the, tree, for, Canada/Nova_Scotia, might, define, Canada/Regions/Atlantic_Provinces, and, Canada, as, the, two, upward, layers., Admins, can, modify, regional, trees, and, create, new, ones, using, the, Tree, Management, Form., Filling, out, the, form, is, only, the, first, part, of, the, job., The, next, steps, are, to, import, all, of, the, categories, and, listings, that, are, included, in, the, tree., This, may, take, some, time, and, effort,, especially, if, there, are, inconsistencies, in, the, existing, category, structure., Editing, In, a, Tree, As, an, editor,, you, will, not, notice, much, difference, when, you, edit, a, category, that, is, part, of, a, tree., The, main, difference, is, the, appearance, of, a, new, input, on, the, URL, editing, forms,, to, define, the, "Topic", of, a, listing., Using, the, dropdown,, you, can, quickly, find, the, most, appropriate, topic, for, every, listing., There, are, three, important, things, to, know:, A, listing, that, has, no, topic, assigned, will, not, appear, in, any, tree, view., This, will, be, the, case, for, listings, that, were, not, placed, in, template, subcategories, at, the, time, the, tree, was, defined,, for, example, top-level, listings, in, small, localities., It, is, important, to, assign, topics, to, these, listings,, so, that, they, may, be, found, in, the, tree, view., You, may, (and, should), assign, topics, that, are, deeper, than, the, category, structure., For, example,, for, a, dentist's, site, you, should, select, the, topic, Health/Dentistry,, even, if, the, category, template, structure, only, goes, as, deep, as, Health., You, cannot, assign, a, topic, that, conflicts, with, the, category, structure., If, you, try, to, assign,, for, example,, the, topic, Society_and_Culture/Spirituality, to, a, listing, in, subcategory, Health/Alternative,, the, editing, system, will, override, your, topic, selection,, and, assign, the, Health/Alternative, topic., Another, change, you, may, notice, is, when, you, create, a, new, subcategory, inside, a, tree, structure., The, editing, system, will, evaluate, topical, subcategories, that, are, not, yet, created, but, for, which, listings, have, already, been, defined, (using, topic, assignments)., If, you, select, one, of, these, subcategories,, the, software, will, offer, to, move, the, corresponding, listings, into, the, new, subcategory,, and, also, create, upward, relcat, links, to, higher-level, regional, entities,, saving, you, just, a, little, bit, of, editing, time, and, effort., Last,
