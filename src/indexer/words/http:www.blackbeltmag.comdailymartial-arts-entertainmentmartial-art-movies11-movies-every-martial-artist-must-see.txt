Post, », 11, Movies, Every, Martial, Artist, Must, See,  Email,  Print,  , Comments,  , RSS, Written, By, creid, –, October, 13,, 2010, I, recently, finished, writing, The, Ultimate, Guide, to, Martial, Arts, Movies, of, the, 1970s., In, one, section,, I, list, my, 20, favorite, films, of, the, ’70s, before, and, after, I, wrote, the, book., Why?, Because, after, watching, 600-plus, movies, during, an, eight-month, stretch,, my, list, had, 14, changes., That, got, me, thinking, about, what, would, constitute, the, 10, movies, every, martial, artist, must, see, and, why—hence,, this, article., The, 11, titles, listed, here—I, couldn’t, narrow, it, down, to, 10—aren’t, the, best, martial, arts, films, ever, made, or, even, my, favorites., Rather,, they, were, chosen, for, the, impact, they, had, on, the, genre,, either, by, presenting, new, directions, in, fight, choreography, or, by, bolstering, international, appeal., Therefore,, they’re, listed, in, order, of, release, date,, not, in, order, of, preference., Martial, Arts, Movie, #1:, Fist, of, Fury, (1972), After, the, Sino-Japanese, War, (1894-1895),, China, was, a, fractured, country,, its, pieces, handed, out, to, Japan, and, various, European, powers., Japan, played, a, villainous, role, in, Chinese, history, from, that, point, on., Even, after, the, nation’s, defeat, during, World, War, II,, the, fear, of, economic, backlash, against, the, Chinese, kept, Hong, Kong, and, the, Republic, of, China, mum, about, Japanese, atrocities, committed, against, the, Chinese., Bruce, Lee’s, Fist, of, Fury, changed, all, that., His, character, defiantly, defeated, Japanese, martial, artists, in, 1909, Shanghai,, when, the, city, was, under, strict, Japanese, rule., Lee, single-handedly, crashed, through, that, barrier, of, silence,, giving, the, Chinese, a, sense, of, identity, and, pride., Although, Story, of, Huang, Feihong,, Part, 1, (1949), ushered, in, the, second, genre, of, Chinese, movies, known, as, gong, fu, pian, (“kung, fu, film,”, in, which, heroes, fought, with, realistic, skills),, Fist, legitimized, it, and, brought, international, prominence, to, Hong, Kong’s, waning, film, industry., Trivia:, The, scene, in, which, Lee, kicks, eight, attackers, in, the, Japanese, dojo, is, one, unedited,, wide-angle, shot., It, forever, changed, fight, choreography., Learn, even, more, about, Fist, of, Fury, with, our, FREE, guide—Our, Bruce, Lee, Movies, List:, Little-Known, Trivia, From, Bruce, Lee’s, Pictures., Martial, Arts, Movie, #2:, The, 36th, Chamber, of, Shaolin, (1978), The, 36th, Chamber, of, Shaolin, (1978), In, response, to, the, popularity, of, the, kung, fu, movies, Jackie, Chan, made, at, Golden, Harvest,, rival, studio, Shaw, Brothers, countered, by, having, filmmakers, Chang, Cheh, and, Liu, Chia-liang, create, a, new, genre, called, guo, shu, pian., Although, translated, as, “national, art, film,”, which, implies, that, the, national, art, is, martial, arts,, guo, shu, films, were, designated, as, neo-hero, movies, because, they, focused, on, a, new, style, of, protagonist., Directed, by, Liu, and, starring, his, adopted, brother, Gordon, Liu, Chia-hui, as, real-life, hero, Monk, San, De, (one, of, the, legendary, “10, Tigers, of, Shaolin”),, The, 36th, Chamber, of, Shaolin, signaled, the, start, of, the, guo, shu, film., It’s, also, important, because, it, was, the, first, movie, to, unveil, the, secret, training, methods, of, the, ancient, Buddhist, monastery., Martial, Arts, Movie, #3:, The, Shaolin, Temple, (1982), The, Shaolin, Temple, (1980), The, importance, of, this, movie, parallels, the, importance, of, its, star., Jet, Li, was, born, during, a, time, when, intellectuals, and, philosophers, were, persecuted,, when, the, government, outlawed, martial, arts, and, even, destroyed, temples, and, executed, monks, who, refused, to, enter, re-education, camps., Li, broke, down, those, walls, and, became, Communist, China’s, first, actor, to, conquer, Hollywood., He, accomplished, that, feat, by, excelling, in, the, cultural, contraband, of, martial, arts,, philosophy, and, cinema., The, Shaolin, Temple, was, China’s, first, live-action, kung, fu, movie, since, the, 1949, Communist, takeover., It, inspired, the, masses, to, visit, the, real, temple’s, remains, and, forced, the, paranoid, government, to, warn, the, public, that, it, was, unnecessary, to, learn, self-defense., It, was, also, instrumental, in, introducing, wushu, to, film, fans, worldwide., Martial, Arts, Movie, #4:, Zu:, Warriors, From, the, Magic, Mountain, (1983), Zu:, Warriors, From, Magic, Mountain, (1982), With, Zu:, Warriors, from, the, Magic, Mountain,, Western-trained,, new-wave, filmmaker, Tsui, Hark, ushered, in, a, fifth, martial, arts, film, genre, that, wasn’t, officially, named, until, it, had, run, its, course., Coined, by, yours, truly,, the, Fant-Asia, genre, combined, elements, of, sex,, fantasy,, sci-fi, and, horror, with, high-flying,, gravity-defying, wire, work,, far-out, sight, gags, and, over-the-top, martial, arts, choreography., The, film’s, action, director,, Ching, Siu-tung, (the, father, of, “wire, fu”),, dared, to, shoot, the, fight, scenes, at, 18, frames, per, second, as, heroes, zipped,, flipped, and, flew, at, the, speed, of, light, amid, explosions, and, magic, weapons., Martial, Arts, Movie, #5:, Duel, to, the, Death, (1983), Duel, to, the, Death, (1983), After, the, success, of, Zu,, Ching, Siu-tung, directed, Duel, to, the, Death, and, proved, that, shooting, old-fashioned, sword, fights, at, 18, frames, per, second, didn’t, make, the, action, look, hokey;, it, made, it, sing, with, gleeful,, steel-slashing, bewitchment., The, movie, intelligently, weaves, in, the, traditions, of, the, classic, chivalrous, swordsman, traveling, down, his, path, of, martyrdom, with, a, quasi-modern,, German, expressionistic, visual, approach, that, combines, the, elemental, filmmaking, sensitivities, of, Tsui, Hark, with, Michael, Curtiz’s, swashbuckling, style., What, does, all, that, mean?, It’s, a, helluva, fun, film, to, watch!, Martial, Arts, Movie, #6:, Police, Story, (1985), Police, Story, (1985), As, the, kung, fu, and, guo, shu, films, started, to, lose, their, luster—due, in, part, to, Hong, Kong’s, copycat, mentality,, in, which, the, fights, were, becoming, too, repetitive—the, 1980s, witnessed, the, birth, of, the, final, two, genres:, Fant-Asia, and, the, one, defined, by, this, movie., At, the, turn, of, the, decade,, Jackie, Chan, wanted, to, do, something, different,, so, he, started, to, avoid, period-piece, films., His, characters, moved, away, from, being, practitioners, of, traditional, kung, fu, and, became, more, like, extreme, athletes,, as, seen, in, Dragon, Lord, (1982)., With, his, next, film,, Project, A, (1983),, and, more, officially, with, Police, Story,, he, created, the, wu, da, pian, (“fight, films, using, martial, arts”), genre., It, combined, athleticism,, martial-arts-influenced, battles, and, outrageous, stunts, wrapped, in, modern, themes, and, settings., Furthermore,, instead, of, using, traditional, kung, fu, movements,, the, battles, incorporated, more, Western-style, boxing, with, karate-like, kicks., Just, about, every, contemporary-themed, martial, arts, movie, shot, since, is, a, result, of, Chan’s, wu, da, style., Martial, Arts, Movie, #7:, Drunken, Master, II, (1994), Drunken, Master, 2, -, 1994, Based, on, fight, choreography,, Drunken, Master, 2, is, arguably, the, best, martial, arts, movie, ever, made., At, the, time, of, its, release,, Fant-Asia, films, were, at, their, peak,, and, other, directors, were, switching, to, Jackie, Chan’s, wu, da, style., Yet, Chan, returned, to, his, kung, fu, roots, to, make, a, superior, sequel., Filled, with, phenomenally, fresh, fights,, it, avoided, the, popular, bobbing, style, of, choreography, used, during, Chan’s, kung, fu, film, heyday., His, martial, skills, flowed, like, a, waterfall, over, smooth, rocks., The, final, 16, minutes, are, as, mesmerizing, and, creative, as, they, are, relentless, and, exhausting., Chan, showed, Hollywood,, which, had, claimed, any, fight, that, lasted, more, than, two, or, three, minutes, was, boring,, that, a, long, battle, could, be, exciting, without, having, to, repeat, the, same, movements, over, and, over., Martial, Arts, Movie, #8:, The, Matrix, (1999), Although, not, a, martial, arts, film,, The, Matrix, was, the, first, mainstream, Western, movie, to, successfully, blend, Hollywood’s, panache, for, visual, effects, with, Hong, Kong’s, stylized, fight, choreography, to, create, what’s, still, considered, a, phenomenon., Matrix, is, a, visual, spectacle., Its, martial, arts, gags, and, imagery, have, been, parodied, ad, infinitum,, and, the, movie, has, become, an, integral, part, of, 20th-century, pop, culture., Trivia:, Matrix, inadvertently, launched, a, ridiculous, Hollywood, trend., When, the, directors, (the, Wachowski, brothers), approached, Yuen, Woo-ping, to, do, the, fights,, he, didn’t, want, to., He, hoped, that, by, asking, for, an, exorbitant, fee,, he, would, turn, them, away., It, didn’t, work,, however., Yuen, then, figured, that, by, demanding, that, the, main, actors, practice, martial, arts, with, him, for, four, months,, he’d, be, off, the, hook., Wrong, again., Hollywood, assumed, that, training, actors, for, fighting, roles, was, the, standard., Martial, Arts, Movie, #9:, Crouching, Tiger,, Hidden, Dragon, (2000), To, die-hard, martial, arts, film, fans,, this, movie, was, nothing, new,, but, to, the, average, American,, Crouching, Tiger, was, something, never, before, encountered., Its, twang, of, novelty, resonated, around, the, world, as, it, became, the, first, Chinese-language, wu, xia, film, to, be, widely, accepted, by, Western, audiences., Wu, xia, was, the, first, genre, of, Chinese, martial, arts, movie;, its, name, translates, as, “martial, chivalrous-hero, film.”, Originating, in, Shanghai, in, the, 1920s,, such, movies, were, saturated, with, classical, tales,, heroic, stories, and, legends, of, superhuman, swordsmen, and, magical, feats., Directed, by, Ang, Lee, and, fight-directed, by, Yuen, Woo-ping,, Crouching, Tiger, blended, Eastern, physical, grace, and, action, with, American, elements, of, performance, intensity, and, the, subtleties, and, nuances, of, European, cinema., The, movie, was, Lee’s, homage, to, wu, xia, films,, and, it, started, a, trend, that, brought, international, attention, to, similar, motion, pictures, by, other, Chinese, directors., Martial, Arts, Movie, #10:, Ong-Bak:, The, Thai, Warrior, (2003), Ong-Bak:, The, Thai, Warrior, -, 2003, Just, when, you, thought, good, martial, arts, movies, were, the, sole, domain, of, China, and, the, United, States,, the, film, industry, of, Thailand, received, worldwide, acclaim., Tony, Jaa’s, Ong-Bak, introduced, a, new, and, dangerous, kind, of, fight, choreography, that, combined, wu, da, action, with, a, stylized, version, of, muay, boran, (the, progenitor, of, muay, Thai)., The, highlights, of, the, movie, are, not, only, Jaa’s, bouts, with, his, meth-crazed, adversary, but, also, Jaa’s, outrageous, stunts:, deadly, knee-drop, strikes,, elbows, of, fury,, far-out, fire, kicks, and, so, on., Jaa, reminded, us, why, we, liked, Jackie, Chan’s, movies, from, the, mid-1980s., More, important,, Jaa’s, efforts, to, showcase, his, nation’s, fighting, arts, inspired, other, countries—including, Vietnam,, Indonesia, and, Malaysia—to, follow, suit., Martial, Arts, Movie, #11:, Ip, Man, (2008), Not, since, Drunken, Master, 2, has, there, been, such, a, rip-roaring,, old-school,, kung, fu, movie., Ip, Man, arrived, on, the, heels, of, those, high-budget,, high-production-value, Chinese/American, wu, xia, films, shot, in, China, using, fancy, wire, work., It, proved, that, traditional, kung, fu, fight, choreography, reminiscent, of, the, 1970s, never, goes, out, of, vogue., The, kung, fu, is, as, real, as, the, legitimate, martial, arts, stars, that, perform, the, fights,, which, is, no, longer, the, case, in, most, movies, that, feature, actors, who, don’t, practice, or, practitioners, who, are, more, into, gymnastics, than, traditional, kung, fu., Not, once, does, Donnie, Yen,, who, plays, Bruce, Lee’s, teacher, Ip, Man, (also, spelled, Yip, Man),, break, wing, chun, form, to, execute, unnecessarily, flashy, movements, to, appease, viewers, who, regard, wushu-style, fights, as, the, real, thing., (For, the, past, 18, years,, Dr., Craig, D., Reid, has, worked, as, a, writer, and, martial, arts, film, critic., He, estimates, that, he’s, watched, more, than, 5,000, martial, arts, movies., He’s, practiced, martial, arts, for, 38, years,, and, since, 1979,, he’s, worked, off, and, on, as, a, fight, choreographer, in, Hollywood, and, Asia., For, more, martial, arts, movie, wisdom,, check, out, his, book,, The, Ultimate, Guide, to, Martial, Arts, Movies, of, the, 1970s:, 500+, Films, Loaded, With,
