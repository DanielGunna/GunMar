Entertainment, |, Movie, Industry, &, Awards, NEXT, PAGENEXT  , If, you've, watched, many, movies, on, video,, you've, probably, read, the, words,, "This, film, has, been, modified, from, its, original, version.", But, how, has, it, been, modified?, The, message, that, appears, at, the, beginning, of, video, tapes, isn't, very, specific., As, it, turns, out,, there, are, a, number, of, ways, video, producers, modify, theatrical, films, for, video, release,, and, elements, of, these, processes, have, sparked, heated, debates, about, maintaining, artistic, visions., In, this, article,, we'll, examine, the, methods, and, issues, involved, in, formatting, movies, for, videos,, DVDs, and, television., We'll, also, take, a, look, at, the, history, of, film, aspect, ratios, and, talk, a, little, bit, about, the, future, of, video, formatting., By, the, end, of, this, article,, you'll, be, able, to, watch, movies, and, videos, with, a, whole, new, understanding, of, the, process, of, their, production!, Up, Next, What, is, 'development, hell'?, Do, directors, whose, movies, bomb, really, wind, up, in, jail?, Why, do, movie, posters, look, so, much, alike?, Why, do, some, movies, go, straight, to, DVD?, What, does, ‘below, the, line’, mean, in, movie, production?, What, is, Video, Formatting?, There, are, a, lot, of, things, involved, in, showing, theatrical, movies, on, a, television, because, movies, and, television, are, very, different, mediums., Movie, film, is, a, very, physical, medium., It's, exactly, like, the, film, in, your, still, camera, in, that, it, records, visual, information, with, chemical, reactions, on, special, material., Video,, on, the, other, hand,, stores, visual, information, as, an, electronic, signal, that, can, be, transmitted, via, radio, waves,, sent, through, coaxial, cable,, etc., Because, of, this,, film, and, video, have, very, different, properties., For, one, thing,, they, don't, split, up, still, images, the, same, way., Filmed, movie, frames, must, therefore, be, reorganized, into, a, video, format, before, a, movie, can, be, shown, on, a, television., The, more, controversial, formatting, issue, is, changing, the, shape, of, a, movie's, picture, so, that, it, fills, a, television, screen., Video, producers, significantly, change, most, movies, from, their, original, theatrical, presentation, because, standard, television, screens, have, a, different, shape, than, standard, movie, pictures., A, standard, television, has, an, aspect, ratio,, or, ratio, of, width, to, height,, of, 4:3., Another, way, to, express, this, ratio, as, 1.33:1., This, means, that, a, television, screen, is, 1.33, times, as, wide, as, it, is, high., Theatrical, movies, are, filmed, using, several, different, aspect, ratios,, almost, all, of, which, are, somewhat, wider, than, a, television, screen., These, days,, the, most, common, U.S., theatrical, aspect, ratios, are, 2.35:1, and, 1.85:1,, but, some, movies, are, even, wider., As, you, can, see,, while, a, television, screen, is, fairly, close, to, a, square,, a, movie, picture, with, a, 2.35:1, aspect, ratio, is, more, than, twice, as, wide, as, it, is, high., Consequently,, modern, movies, do, not, automatically, fit, standard, television, screens., In, order, to, release, a, movie, on, VHS, video, and, DVD, or, broadcast, it, on, television,, video, and, television, producers, have, to, accommodate, this, difference., There, are, a, number, of, ways, of, accomplishing, this,, each, of, which, we'll, examine., We'll, also, look, at, why, televisions, and, theatrical, movies, have, different, aspect, ratios, in, the, first, place, and, explore, the, "widescreen, vs., pan, and, scan", debate., But, first,, let's, look, at, the, first, step, in, video, formatting,, turning, moving, pictures, on, film, into, moving, pictures, on, video., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, NEXT , Print, |, Citation, &, Date, More, to, Explore, Related,
