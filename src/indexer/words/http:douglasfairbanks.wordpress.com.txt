July, 12,, 2012, by, Fairbanks, Museum, On, Sunday,, July, 15th, the, San, Francisco, Silent, Film, Festival, will, screen, The, Mark, of, Zorro, (1920),, starring, Douglas, Fairbanks,, Sr., As, Zorro,, a, masked, champion, of, the, people,, Fairbanks, displays, the, athletic, prowess,, humor,, and, rakish, charm, that, would, propel, him, to, super-stardom., The, film, is, a, classic,, and, in, it, Fairbanks, set, the, bar, high, for, subsequent, action-adventure, films, in, what, was, his, first-ever, swashbuckler., Set, to, introduce, The, Mark, of, Zorro, is, Jeffrey, Vance,, Fairbanks, scholar, and, author, of, Douglas, Fairbanks,, which, was, published, by, the, University, of, California, Press., Vance, is, a, film, historian,, archivist,, producer,, lecturer, and, the, author, of, a, trilogy, of, earlier, books,, each, highly, regarded,, on, film, greats, Charlie, Chaplin,, Buster, Keaton,, and, Harold, Lloyd., Vance, will, be, signing, copies, of, his, books, following, the, Sunday, screening, The, Mark, of, Zorro., Recently,, I, spoke, with, Vance, about, Fairbanks,, silent, film,, his, work, as, a, film, historian,, and, what, he, is, looking, forward, to, seeing, at, this, year’s, Festival., Jeffrey, Vance, in, Hollywood,  , Thomas, Gladysz:, How, did, you, become, interested, in, Douglas, Fairbanks?, Jeffrey, Vance:, I, became, interested, in, Fairbanks, as, a, result, of, my, early, interest, in, Charles, Chaplin., Fairbanks, was, Chaplin’s, great, friend,, and, a, partner, in, the, United, Artists, Corporation., He, was, also, a, Hollywood, superstar, along, with, Chaplin, and, Mary, Pickford., I, wrote, Mary, Pickford, a, fan, letter, at, the, end, of, her, life., She, responded, with, an, encouraging, letter., Fairbanks’s, namesake, son, also, provided, encouragement, later, on., Thomas, Gladysz:, Fairbanks, was, more, than, a, popular, actor—he, was, an, innovator, and, pioneer., Jeffrey, Vance:, Yes., Douglas, Fairbanks, was, one, of, the, most, creative, producers, in, America, and, one, of, Hollywood’s, great, leaders., He, came, to, films, as, a, Broadway, star,, transitioned, to, films, first, as, a, screen, satirist, and, then,, of, course,, as, the, great, screen, swashbuckler., Beyond, that,, he, was, a, civic, leader,, an, independent, producer,, the, first, president, of, the, Academy, of, Motion, Picture, Arts, and, Sciences,, and, a, developer, of, America’s, first, film, school,, now, called, the, USC, School, of, Cinematic, Arts., Fairbanks, helped, pioneer, and, popularize, Technicolor, cinematography, and, original, film, scores., And,, his, film, collection, was, one, of, the, first, important, film, deposits, at, the, Museum, of, Modern, Art;, Fairbanks, was, also, a, pioneer, of, film, preservation., In, short,, Fairbanks, was, at, the, forefront, of, many, important, things., Thomas, Gladysz:, At, this, year’s, SFSFF,, you’re, introducing, The, Mark, of, Zorro., What, should, viewers, expect?, Jeffrey, Vance:, The, Mark, of, Zorro, is, a, landmark, not, only, in, Fairbanks’, career, but, also, in, the, development, of, the, action, adventure, film., With, The, Mark, of, Zorro,, Fairbanks, was, transitioning, from, comedies, to, the, costume, films, for, which, he, is, best, remembered., Instead, of, reflecting, the, times,, The, Mark, of, Zorro, offers, an, infusion, of, the, romantic, past, with, a, contemporary, flair., Prior, to, Fairbanks,, most, costume, films, had, been, largely, turgid, affairs;, Fairbanks’, contribution, to, the, costume, film, was, his, winning, charm,, humor,, and, athleticism, executed, in, a, modern, manner., Beyond, re-energizing, his, career, and, redefining, a, genre,, The, Mark, of, Zorro, also, helped, popularize, one, of, the, enduring, creations, of, twentieth, century, American, fiction,, a, character, that, was, the, prototype, for, comic, book, heroes, such, as, Batman., Bob, Kane, told, me, that, Fairbanks’, Zorro, costume,, secret, lair,, and, dual, identity, inspired, Batman., And,, of, course,, footage, from, the, original, The, Mark, of, Zorro, is, cleverly, interwoven, into, the, Oscar-winning, film,, The, Artist., Douglas, Fairbanks,, by, Jeffrey, Vance, Thomas, Gladysz:, Speaking, of, The, Artist,, Fairbanks’, persona, obviously, influenced, the, film’s, lead, character,, George, Valentin., What, did, you, think, of, the, film?, Jeffrey, Vance:, I, think, The, Artist, is, a, miracle., The, fact, is, it, raised, a, “dead”, art, form—the, silent, cinema—like, Lazarus., It’s, no, longer, perceived, as, irrelevant;, someone, else, could, conceivably, make, another, silent, film, and, it, too, could, garner, critical, and, commercial, success., Thanks, to, the, Weinstein, Company,, I, was, able, to, attend, several, screenings, and, events, promoting, the, film., It, was, gratifying, to, hear, writer/director, Michel, Hazanavicius, tell, me, that, the, creative, team, behind, The, Artist, had, my, Douglas, Fairbanks, book,, and, that, it, was, the, book, and, all, the, screenings, and, events, around, the, book, that, helped, shape, the, character, of, George, Valentin,, played, by, Jean, Dujardin., They, could, have, easily, modeled, the, character, on, John, Gilbert, or, Rudolph, Valentino., Thomas, Gladysz:, What, draws, you, to, silent, film?, Jeffrey, Vance:, For, me,, a, great, draw, is, that, the, viewer, is, part, of, the, creative, process., The, viewer, is, interpreting, the, images, on, the, screen., Silent, cinema, is, like, opera, and, ballet;, what’s, not, provided, the, viewer, provides, with, their, imagination., As, a, result,, one, is, more, involved, with, silent, cinema, than, with, other, types, of, films., They, mean, more, to, the, viewer., Thomas, Gladysz:, As, a, film, historian, and, author,, what’s, next?, Jeffrey, Vance:, I’ve, done, quite, a, few, audio, commentary, tracks., Recently, released,, The, Gold, Rush, for, Criterion, Collection, is, my, best, commentary, work, and, my, favorite., I’ve, also, recorded, tracks, for, Fairbanks’s, The, Thief, of, Bagdad, for, the, Cohen, Collection,, as, well, as, the, 1944, British, comedy, On, Approval, for, Inception, Media, Group., I’m, recording, another, for, Warner, Home, Video, at, the, end, of, the, month., I’ve, also, done, quite, a, bit, of, work, in, the, past, year, for, Roy, Export,, the, Chaplin, family, organization, that, controls, the, copyrighted, Chaplin, films, as, well, as, the, Chaplin, image., A, Chaplin, film, deposit, now, joins, the, Chaplin, photographic, collection, at, the, Academy, of, Motion, Picture, Arts, and, Sciences., I, helped, negotiate, and, arrange, that, collection., These, two, important, collections, will, be, celebrated, by, the, Academy, in, the, near, future., Recently,, I, took, the, NBC, Today, Show, on, a, Chaplin, tour,, it, will, air, sometime, after, the, Olympics., I, am, also, working, on, a, book, project, about, Mary, Pickford., The, late, Robert, Cushman,, a, leading, Pickford, expert, and, photo, curator, at, the, Academy, of, Motion, Picture, Arts, and, Sciences,, wrote, several, chapters, for, a, critical, study, of, Pickford., Robert, also, conducted, interviews, with, cinematographers, Hal, Mohr,, director, George, Cukor,, and, others, in, the, early, 1970s., Manoah, Bowman,, the, executor, of, Robert’s, estate,, has, allowed, me, exclusive, use, of, these, materials, to, develop, into, a, complete, book., I, intend, to, augment, Robert’s, materials, with, my, own, interview, materials, and, research., I, believe, it, will, be, an, important, Pickford, book., The, Mark, of, Zorro, (1920),, stars, the, masked, Douglas, Fairbanks, (left),  , Thomas, Gladysz:, Besides, The, Mark, of, Zorro,, which, films, at, this, year’s, festival, most, intrigue, you?, Jeffrey, Vance:, For, me,, there, are, three, must-see, films., Mantrap, is, a, comedy, gem., With, a, capacity, Castro, crowd,, Mantrap, may, very, well, bring, the, house, down., It’s, Clara, Bow’s, best, film., I, find, we’re, still, catching, up, with, Clara, Bow!, She, was, very, much, of, her, time, yet, ahead, of, her, time., Another, is, Pandora’s, Box., Silent, films, are, all, about, picture, quality., In, an, inferior, print,, you’re, taking, away, vital, information., Louise, Brooks, really, comes, alive, in, the, new, restoration., To, see, additional, detail, in, her, performance, is, to, see, the, film, for, the, first, time., And, Louise, Brooks, in, Pandora’s, Box, is, a, performance, for, the, ages!, Finally,, I’m, keen, to, revisit, The, Wonderful, Lies, of, Nina, Petrovna., The, film, co-stars, Francis, Lederer,, and, I, remember, being, seated, next, to, him, when, the, film, was, shown, in, his, honor, at, Cinecon, in, Hollywood, in, the, 1990s., It, was, an, amazing, film,, and, Mr., Lederer, was, flabbergasted, at, this, silent, picture, he, made, early, in, his, long, career., At, the, film’s, conclusion,, he, kept, repeating,, “I, can’t, believe, how, good, this, picture, is., That, man, Schwarz, [Hanns, Schwarz,, the, film’s, director], was, a, genius!”, These, films, are, just, shells, of, themselves, on, home, video, or, screened, in, museums/archives., They, were, designed, and, timed, for, the, big, screen,, large, audiences,, and, live, music., Anything, else, isn’t, the, authentic, silent, film, experience., I’m, very, grateful, to, the, San, Francisco, Silent, Film, Festival, for, the, opportunities, they, provide, to, revisit, and, rediscover, the, very, fragile, art, form, that, is, the, silent, cinema., *****, Further, information, about, the, San, Francisco, Silent, Film, Festival, can, be,

buff,, and, the, Director, of, the, Louise, Brooks, Society,, an, internet-based, archive, and, international, fan, club, devoted, to, the, silent, film, star., Gladysz, has, contributed, to, books, on, the, actress,, organized, exhibits,, appeared, on, television, and, radio,, and, introduced, Brooks’, films, around, the, world., He, will, be, signing, copies, of, his, “Louise, Brooks, edition”,

May, 23,, 2011, by, Fairbanks, Museum, MUSEUM, RE-OPENS, IN, SPITE, OF, HARDSHIPS, By, Dr., Laura, Murray,, museum, volunteer, Despite, of, the, national, economic, recession,, a, mold, infestation, in, the, museum’s, former, building,, and, a, burglary, that, resulted, in, the, loss, of, hundreds, of, rare, artifacts, last, year,, the, Douglas, Fairbanks, Museum, is, finally, back, open, again., On, what, would, have, been, the, 128th, birthday, of, the, great, silent, film, star,, the, museum, held, a, Grand, Reopening, celebration, and, once, again, welcomed, visitors, into, the, museum’s, new, home., “This, is, such, a, happy, day,”, museum, curator, Keri, Leigh, told, the, assembled, group, of, volunteers,, supporters, and, guests., “We’ve, had, more, than, our, share, of, challenges, over, the, past, few, years,, and, sometimes, we, wondered, if, this, moment, would, ever, come., Thanks, to, your, support, and, the, hard, work, of, our, dedicated, volunteers,, we, are, open, to, the, public, again.”, Overcome, by, emotion,, at, one, point, Leigh, broke, down, in, tears, while, describing, the, holiday, 2010, burglary, that, resulted, in, the, loss, of, hundreds, of, rare, photographs,, three-dimensional, artifacts,, and, a, sizable, portion, of, the, museum’s, film, and, periodicals, collections., “Several, of, these, items, were, more, than, 100, years, old;, many, were, one, of, a, kind, and, simply, cannot, be, replaced,”, she, said., “We’re, trying, our, best, to, re-build, the, archives,, but, it, will, take, many, years, to, ever, get, back, to, where, we, were, before, the, burglary., “Funding, needed, to, acquire, new, artifacts, just, isn’t, there.”, Leigh, explained., “Since, the, economic, downturn, of, 2008,, the, gifts, and, endowments, that, used, to, sustain, us, have, dropped, dramatically., This, is, true, for, museums, and, libraries, everywhere,, but, it, hit, us, especially, hard, in, light, of, all, these, tragedies., Insurance, only, covers, the, fair, market, value,, not, the, historic, value, of, collectibles, such, as, these., In, many, respects,, we, will, never, be, made, whole, again, because, there’s, just, no, way, to, replace, many, of, the, items, that, were, stolen., They, were, the, only, ones, known, to, exist, in, the, world.”, Although, the, museum, offered, a, cash, reward, and, a, 90-day, amnesty, period, for, return, of, the, stolen, artifacts,, no, one, ever, came, forward., To, date,, these, hundreds, of, rare, photographs,, periodicals,, films,, and, three-dimensional, items, have, not, been, located., The, thieves, remain, at, large., Private, investigators, are, working, pro, bono, hoping, to, crack, the, case., “I’m, just, grateful, for, what, we, still, have.”, She, said., “By, the, grace, of, God,, we, are, here, today, to, share, what’s, left, of, our, collection, with, you, all., We’ve, been, here, since, 1998, and, we, have, always, triumphed, over, tragedy., We’re, not, going, away, as, long, as, I, still, have, breath, in, me., We’re, not, going, to, let, a, recession,, mold,, or, thieves, get, the, better, of, us., We, believe, that, is, in, keeping, with, the, message, of, Douglas, Fairbanks;, to, never, give, up,, to, fight, on, in, the, face, of, adversity, and, injustice.”, Leigh’s, remarks, brought, wild, applause, and, a, standing, ovation, from, the, assembled, group., She, pointed, to, a, poster, of, Douglas, Fairbanks, in, a, typically, bold, swashbuckling, pose,, ready, to, take, on, the, bad, guys, with, his, rapier:, “See, that, fellow, right, there?, He’s, our, inspiration., He’s, the, reason, we, carry, on.”, Fairbanks, in, "The, Black, Pirate,", 1926., GUESTS, TRAVELED, MANY, MILES, Visitors, traveled, from, as, far, away, as, Dallas,, Oklahoma,, Colorado, and, California, to, attend, the, reopening., Leigh, also, read, aloud, cards,, letters, and, emails, of, congratulations, and, well-wishes, from, museum, supporters, who, could, not, attend, in, person., Among, them, was, an, email, she, recently, received, from, one, of, Fairbanks’, great-great-grandsons, in, England,, who, just, penned, a, school, term, paper, about, his, great-grandfather., “I’m, just, thrilled, to, see, kids, taking, an, interest, in, Douglas, Fairbanks, again,”, Leigh, said., “It, made, me, beam, with, pride, when, I, read, young, Fairbanks’, final, report, about, his, great-grandfather’s, vast, contributions, to, the, Allied, war, effort, in, WWII., He, should, be, proud, of, his, family’s, legacy.”, The, Campisi, family, traveled, from, California, to, attend, the, reopening, celebration., While, browsing, through, a, “look, book” , documenting, the, stolen, artifacts,, Mr., Campisi, tried, to, help, his, 7, year, old, son, understand, why, the, items, were, not, available, for, him, to, see, and, touch., “This, makes, me, so, sad,”, Mrs., Campisi, said, solemnly,, “but, it, also, makes, me, angry., What, kind, of, people, steal, a, child’s, education?, A, thief’s, greed, denied, my, son, and, future, generations, the, opportunity, to, learn, about, a, great, pioneer, of, the, film, industry.”, Mr., Campisi, added,, “if, the, thieves, should, ever, meet, up, with, the, ghost, of, Douglas, Fairbanks, one, dark, night,, they, had, better, watch, out!, I’m, pretty, sure, old, Doug, wouldn’t, be, very, happy, about, what, they’ve, done., That’s, all, I, can, say.”, A, rare, 1920s, photo, of, Fairbanks', "Rancho, Zorro,", stolen, in, the, burglary., ALL, FOR, ONE,, ONE, FOR, ALL, Visitors, enjoyed, refreshments,, guided, tours, of, the, museum’s, new, exhibit, and, library, space,, and, a, screening, of, Fairbanks’, 1921, classic,, “The, Three, Musketeers.”, As, a, show, of, solidarity, at, the,

game., As, the, sun, was, setting, and, the, last, guest, departed,, the, remaining, staff, and, volunteers, began, cleaning, up., Before, locking, up, for, the, night,, we, took, a, moment, to, survey, the, new, gallery, space, one, more, time., Someone, said, all, the, hard, work, to, rebuild, had, been, well, worth, it., We, all, just, stopped, in, our, tracks, and, nodded, an, “amen!”, We, saved, the, candles, from, Doug’s, birthday, cake, and, each, volunteer, took, one, as, a, special, souvenir, to, remind, us, all, of, this, very, special, day., We, will, never, forget, it.,
