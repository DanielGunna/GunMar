editor, to, head, Britain’s, most, powerful, fashion, magazine, in, its, 100-year, history., I, wondered, what, Diana, Vreeland, would, say, about, this., My, bet:, She’d, cheer., —-, Prepare, to, be, dazzled., You, know, all, about, “pink, is, the, navy, blue, of, India”, and, “wash, your, blond, child’s, hair, with, dead, champagne”, and, “the, bikini, is, the, most, important, invention, since, the, H-bomb”,, but, you, may, have, been, busy, elsewhere, when, Diana, Vreeland’s, memoir, appeared., Well,, the, former, fashion, editor, of, Harper’s, Bazaar, and, the, onetime, editor-in-chief, of, Vogue, was, just, as, outlandish, in, her, book, as, she, was, in, the, slick, pages, of, fashion, magazines., And, just, as, grand., In, the, first, three, pages, of, D, .V.,, she, namedrops, Irving, (“Swifty”), Lazar,, Oscar, de, la, Renta,, a, tony, London, restaurant, called, San, Lorenzo,, a, bare-assed, Jack, Nicholson, and, Ahmet, Ertegun., If, you, are, of, a, certain, age, and,

is., Five, years, before, her, death,, I, profiled, Diana, Vreeland, for, New, York, Magazine., It, was, a, remarkable, experience, for, a, journalist, who, likes, his, facts, to, be…well,, factual., From, time, to, time, Mrs., V., alighted, on, data, I, could, confirm;, when, she, did,, it, was, an, event., Her, concerns, were, more, exalted., Beauty., Poetry., And,, not, least,, mythology, —,

mortals, mad., What, is, true, is, that, she, was, a, remarkable, performance, artist, —, a, self-created, actress, who, played, her, role, 24/7., For, although, she, was, born, to, money, and, married, well,, the, bottom, line, was, that, she, was, completely, dependent, on, a, salary., And, so, were, her, husband, and, kids,, for, Reed, Vreeland, had, no, skill, in, business., And, yet,

And, when, he, died,, she, mourned, him, deeply, —, though,, in, typical, Vreeland, style,, there, was, no, funeral, and, she, was, back, at, the, office, the, next, day., Bill, Blass, knew, her, well., And, he, was, compassionate, about, her, self-invention:, “’Part, of, her, creativity, was, that, she, took, perfect, liberty, in, exaggerating, or, changing, things, as, she, saw, fit, or, wanted, them, to, be.”, So, she, pretended, she, was, rich,, had, her, shoes, —, including, the, soles, —, shined, and, her, sheets, ironed, every, day., She, didn’t, show, up, at, Vogue, until,

movie, of, the, year:, “Their, Finest”, I’ve, finally, seen, a, new, film, that, thrilled, me., It’s, 1940,, and, the, English, film, business, is, making, movies, that, inspire, neither, patriotism, nor, interest,, so, a, division, is, formed, to, make, “realistic, and, optimistic”, movies., Gemma, Arterton, is, hired, to, punch, up, the, female, dialogue., She’s, the, core, of, the, film,, but, Bill, Nighy, pretty, much, steals, the, movie, as, —, his, words, —, “a, chronically, self-absorbed,, pompous, actor, in, his, declining, years, who’s, in, almost, perfect, denial, about, how, old, he, is.”, The, Times, review, is, a, flat-out, rave:, “’Their, Finest’, is, too, understandably, serious, to, be, called, a, romp,, yet, it, has, a, buoyancy, that, lifts, you.”, I’d, go, further:, These, writers, and, actors, will, have, you,, as, Nighy, says,, “weeping, in, the, aisles.”, I, never, say, this, about, a, film, in, English:, I’ll, see, it, again., “Wink”, —, B-list, characters,
