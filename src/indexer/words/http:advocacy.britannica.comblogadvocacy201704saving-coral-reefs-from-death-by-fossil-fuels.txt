Austin, —, Our, thanks, to, Earthjustice, for, permission, to, republish, this, post,, which, originally, appeared, on, the, Earthjustice, Blog, on, April, 7,, 2017., Around, the, world,, coral, reefs, are, flashing, warning, signs, telling, us, that, climate, change, is, happening, now, and, with, frightening, effects., Corals, in, Hawai‘i,, New, Caledonia,, the, Seychelles,, Kiribati, and, elsewhere, are, bleaching, and, dying, because, of, ocean, warming, and, acidification, caused, by, climate, change., On, the, Great, Barrier, Reef, in, my, home, country, of, Australia,, a, staggering, 22, percent, of, corals, died, last, year—the, worst, coral, die-off, in, recorded, history., Climate, change, is, driven, by, greenhouse, gas, pollution,, the, largest, source, of, which, is, burning, fossil, fuels., Recently,, I, travelled, to, Paris, and, Geneva, with, Earthjustice, colleagues,, a, representative, of, Environmental, Justice, Australia, and, a, scientific, expert., We, asked, the, World, Heritage, Committee, to, urge, nations, to, act, now, to, curb, carbon, emissions,, in, order, to, protect, World, Heritage-listed, coral, reefs, and, other, iconic, World, Heritage, sites, from, the, impacts, of, climate, change., Our, meetings, with, members, of, the, committee, give, me, hope, that, the, international, community, will, protect, our, irreplaceable, heritage, sites, by, holding, big, polluting, nations, like, the, U.S., and, Australia, accountable, for, their, contributions, to, climate, change., Earthjustice, Senior, Research, and, Policy, Analyst, Jessica, Lawrence,, Earthjustice, Permanent, Representative, in, Geneva, Yves, Lador,, and, Earthjustice, Staff, Attorney, Noni, Austin, stand, outside, the, United, Nations, Educational,, Scientific, and, Cultural, Organization, building, in, Paris., Earthjustice, Senior, Research, and, Policy, Analyst, Jessica, Lawrence,, Earthjustice, Permanent, Representative, in, Geneva, Yves, Lador,, and, Earthjustice, Staff, Attorney, Noni, Austin, stand, outside, the, United, Nations, Educational,, Scientific, and, Cultural, Organization, building, in, Paris., Jessica, Lawrence/Earthjustice., The, World, Heritage, Committee, is, an, intergovernmental, body, that, implements, the, World, Heritage, Convention,, an, international, agreement, that, commits, countries, to, protecting, some, of, the, world’s, most, precious, places., When, governments, fail, to, protect, World, Heritage, sites, within, their, borders,, the, committee, can, take, action, by, pressuring, the, governments, and, focusing, global, attention, on, sites, that, are, in, danger., During, our, trip,, we, introduced, our, new, legal, analysis,, “World, Heritage, and, Climate, Change:, The, Legal, Responsibility, of, States, to, Reduce, Their, Contributions, to, Climate, Change—A, Great, Barrier, Reef, Case, Study.”, In, this, report,, we, show, that, nations, with, World, Heritage-listed, coral, reefs, must, take, serious, and, effective, action, to, reduce, their, contributions, to, climate, change., We, then, lay, out, a, path, for, the, World, Heritage, Committee, to, follow, in, order, to, encourage, stronger, action, from, the, many, nations, that, are, failing, to, do, their, part,, including, by, recommending, that, governments, not, approve, or, fund, new, coal, mines, or, power, plants., Australia, provides, a, case, in, point., It, is, custodian, of, the, Great, Barrier, Reef—one, of, the, world’s, most, complex, ecosystems—and, has, primary, responsibility, for, the, reef’s, protection., Yet, it’s, doggedly, pursuing, dirty, fossil, fuels, by, permitting, the, development, of, the, some, of, the, largest, new, coal, mines, in, the, world,, which, will, contribute, substantially, to, climate, change, and, the, further, deterioration, of, the, Great, Barrier, Reef., The, annual, emissions, from, mining, and, burning, coal, from, just, one, of, these, proposed, mines—the, Carmichael, mine—would, be, greater, than, the, annual, emissions, of, Sri, Lanka,, Bangladesh,, Malaysia, or, Austria., Australia, is, already, one, of, the, highest, per-capita, emitters, of, greenhouse, gases, in, the, world,, and, it, appears, unlikely, to, meet, its, emissions-reduction, goals, under, the, international, Paris, Climate, Agreement, Australia, has, also, permitted, the, expansion, of, a, coal, export, terminal, at, Abbot, Point,, adjacent, to, the, Great, Barrier, Reef, World, Heritage, Area., The, port, expansion, requires, seabed, dredging, within, the, World, Heritage, area, and, will, boost, the, number, of, industrial, ships, traversing, the, reef,, increasing, the, likelihood, of, shipping, accidents, and, spills., All, of, this, is, occurring, while, the, Great, Barrier, Reef, wastes, away, from, the, impacts, of, climate, change., When, nations, like, Australia, fail, to, take, serious, and, effective, action, to, reduce, their, contributions, to, climate, change,, the, World, Heritage, Committee, can, and, must, take, them, to, task,, in, order, to, protect, World, Heritage, sites, around, the, globe., The, committee, has, the, power,, the, opportunity, and, the, responsibility, to, do, so., Earthjustice, will, continue, to, support, the, World, Heritage, Committee, in, its, vital, work, to, protect, humanity’s, most, beloved, places, and, to, hold, governments, who, put, those, places, in, danger, to, account., Acidification, Climate, change, Coral, reefs, Global, warming, Great,
