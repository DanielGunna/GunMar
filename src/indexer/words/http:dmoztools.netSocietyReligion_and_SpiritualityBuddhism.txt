the, teachings, of, the, Buddha., There, are, many, schools, or, flavours, of, Buddhism,, so, it, can, be, confusing, at, times,, especially, to, anyone, unfamiliar, with, the, subject., This, category, is, about, the, religion, Buddha, founded,, and, includes, information, on, the, schools,, people,, practice,, philosophy,, and, study, of, Buddhism., The, fundamental, ideas, of, Buddhism, are:, 1.), All, human, life, is, "dhukka", (impermanent, unsatisfactoriness)., 2.), All, suffering, is, caused, by, human, desire,, particularly, the, desire, that, impermanent, things, be, permanent., 3.), Human, suffering, can, be, ended, by, ending, human, desire., 4.), Desire, can, be, ended, by, following, the, "Eightfold, Noble, Path":, right, understanding,, right, thought,, right, speech,, right, action,, right, livelihood,, right, effort,, right, mindfulness,, and, right, concentration., From, a, metaphysical, standpoint,, these, Noble, Truths, make, up, and, derive, from, a, single, fundamental, Truth, (Dharma)., The, Buddhadharma, is, based, on, the, idea, that, everything, in, the, universe, is, causally, linked., All, things, are, composite, things,, that, is,, they, are, composed, of, several, elements., Because, all, things, are, composite,, they, are, all, transitory,, for, the, elements, come, together, and, then, fall, apart., It, is, this, transience, that, causes, human, beings, to, sorrow, and, to, suffer., We, live, in, a, body,, which, is, a, composite, thing,, but, that, body, decays,, sickens,, and, eventually, dies,, though, we, wish, it, to, do, otherwise., Since, everything, is, transient,, that, means, that, there, can, be, no, eternal, soul, either, in, the, self, or, in, the, universe., Subcategories, 36, New, Kadampa,
