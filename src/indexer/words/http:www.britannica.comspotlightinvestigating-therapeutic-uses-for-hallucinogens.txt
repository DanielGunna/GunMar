that, include, distorted, sensory, perception, and, dreamlike, states, of, consciousness., For, thousands, of, years,, hallucinogenic, substances, have, been, linked, with, profound, mystical, experience;, the, Rigveda, mentions, a, plant, substance, known, as, Soma,, which,, when, ingested,, produced, brilliant, visions, of, paradise., Most, scholars, believe, the, drug, was, a, hallucinogen,, although, the, exact, plant, is, unidentified, in, modern, times., The, Eleusinian, Mysteries,, an, ancient, Greek, ritual, that, persisted, for, nearly, 2,000, years,, were, likewise, centered, on, a, beverage,, known, as, kykeon,, that, was, capable, of, producing, altered, states, of, consciousness., In, the, Americas,, the, Aztecs, used, a, variety, of, hallucinogenic, substances, in, religious, and, social, rituals., In, the, 1950s, and, ’60s,, hallucinogens, were, the, subject, of, serious, scientific, study., One, of, the, most-famous, studies, was, the, so-called, Good, Friday, Experiment,, in, which, 20, theology, students, were, given, the, hallucinogen, psilocybin, or, a, placebo, during, a, Good, Friday, church, service., The, students, who, received, psilocybin, reported, having, intense, religious, experiences., The, apparent, link, between, hallucinogen, use, and, spiritual, experience, led, some, researchers, to, investigate, the, possible, uses, of, hallucinogens, as, a, treatment, for, psychiatric, problems, such, as, addiction,, anxiety,, and, depression., The, use, of, hallucinogens, in, scientific, research, was, paralleled, by, their, proliferation, in, the, counterculture, as, recreational, drugs., The, widespread, recreational, use, of, hallucinogens, in, “hippy”, culture, provoked, a, cultural, and, political, backlash, that, ultimately, led, to, the, criminalization, of, such, drugs, under, the, Controlled, Substances, Act, of, 1970;, this, legislation, also, had, the, effect, of, suppressing, most, scientific, research, concerning, hallucinogens., After, a, long, absence,, hallucinogens, began, to, reappear, in, scientific, research, in, the, late, 1990s., The, new, studies,, which, have, investigated, the, therapeutic, applications, of, hallucinogens, for, a, variety, of, conditions,, have, been, conducted, with, greater, methodological, rigor, and, attention, to, patient, safety, than, their, predecessors, in, the, 1960s., Most, of, the, studies, have, been, small,, since, hallucinogens, are, still, tightly, controlled,, and, the, U.S., government, does, not, recognize, any, legitimate, medical, uses, and, thus, does, not, offer, any, funding, for, research., But, researchers, have, generally, characterized, their, initial, results, as, very, promising., For, example,, studies, on, patients, with, terminal, illnesses, found, that, the, mystical, experiences, induced, by, psilocybin, produced, stronger, and, longer-lasting, improvements, in, patients’, symptoms, of, depression, and, anxiety, than, conventional, treatments., Learn, More, About, This, Topic, 1, What, are, hallucinogens?, 2, Learn, more, about, the, use, of, hallucinogenic, drugs, in, religious,
