thrilled, and, surprised, to, receive, this, award., I, hope, that, it, is, a, recognition, of, the, artistic, capacity, of, young, choirs., For, this, reason, I, would, like, to, pay, tribute, to, all, and, my, colleagues, around, the, country, who, work, with, children’s, choirs, at, a, high, level., What, are, you, currently, working, on?, I, am, currently, preparing, for, two, international, tours., The, first, is, a, unique, collaboration, between, the, Cairns, Gondwana, Indigenous, Children’s, Choir, and, the, Vienna, Boys’, Choir., The, Cairns, choir, will, soon, travel, to, Vienna, and, later, in, the, year, the, Vienna, Boys’, Choir, will, perform, with, us, in, Sydney, and, Cairns., What, happens, when, you, juxtapose, the, oldest, continuous, culture, on, earth, with, a, choir, more, than, 600, years, old?, In, July,, I, will, tour, to, the, Baltic, countries, and, Iceland, with, Gondwana, Voices,, our, national, treble, choir., Meanwhile, we, have, recently, completed, our, national, Choral, School, with, 325, young, singers,, composers, and, conductors, from, around, the, country;, Sydney, Children’s, Choir, is, in, full, swing;, our, three, Indigenous,

career, advice, you, would, give, your, younger, self?, To, rejoice, in, every, new, creative, idea, and, all, the, challenges, which, accompany, each, new, project., Having, said, that,, I’m, not, sure, I, would, do, anything, too, differently., What, inspires, you, or, has, been, the, greatest, influence, of, your, work?, I, am, not, sure, that, there, is, one, particular, source, of, inspiration., Creatively, I, feel, like, all, the, threads, of, my, life, come, together, in, the, creation, of, new, ideas., I, am, inspired, by, the, young, singer/artists, I, work, with,, the, boundless, capacity, of, young, brains,, by, the, great, musicians,, composers, and, creative, minds, I, have, collaborated, with,, by, the, Indigenous, artists,, traditional, owners,, and, cultural, custodians, I, have, had, the, privilege, to, learn, from,, by, the, dedicated, administrative, staff, of, Gondwana, Choirs,, and, all, the, remarkable, volunteers, always, willing, to, make, things, happen., Can, you, describe, the, practical, process, you, use, to, develop, ideas/concepts, for, your, work?, A, new, project, will, germinate, in, my, mind,, sometimes, in, minutes,, sometimes, over, some, days, or, even, months,, then, as, I, walk, into, the, office,, my, “new, idea, eyes”, will, be, a, dead, giveaway., Ideas, will, be, discussed, and, many, approaches,, implications,, budgets, and, benefits, will, be, considered., I, welcome, suggestions, from, all, involved, and, when, working, with, young, people, I, consider, it, essential, to, involve, them, in, the, creative, process, as, far, as, practicable., Why, is, it, important, to, engage, children, and, young, people, in, the, arts?, What, are, some, recurring, challenges, that, are, characteristic, of, that, process, and, how, do, you, suggest, people, overcome, them?, Participation, in, the, arts, is, clearly, essential, for, all, young, people., Children, are, driven, by, imagination, and, creativity,, this, is, how, they, find, their, identity, and, their, place, in, the, world., Through, the, arts, they, can, express, this, in, the, most, powerful, way., Children’s, choirs, certainly, contribute, to, the, development, of, the, child,, but, I, would, say, they, are, also, a, unique, gift, to, the, world., Young, voices, are, as, remarkable, and, beautiful, as, they, are, transient., They, are, not, simply, children, practicing, to, be, good, adult, choirs,, but, artists, able, to, perform, at, a, professional, level, within, an, ensemble, that, is, as, valid, as,, say,, a, string, quartet.,
