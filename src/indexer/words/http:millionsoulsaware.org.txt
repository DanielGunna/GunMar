has, been, reached!, The, next, step, will, be, announced, very, soon, on, this, page., refugee, camps, worldwide, Imagine, that, your, life,, as, you, know, it,, disappears, in, the, blink, of, an, eye., War,, violence, or, fear, for, your, family’s, safety, force, you, to, flee, your, home., After, hours, or, even, days, of, a, torturous, journey,, you, find, shelter, far, away,, in, a, squalid, tent., You, are, dependent, on, handouts, of, food;, possibly, have, no, clean, drinking, water, or, access, to, health, care, that, prevents, outbreaks, of, cholera,, dysentery,, hepatitis,, malaria,, and, other, diseases., Not, a, pretty, picture,, right?, But, the, fact, is, that, millions, of, people, around, the, world,, in, countries, big, and, small,, people, of, all, ages, and, many, nationalities,, have, been, living, in, such, desolate, and, precarious, conditions, for, years., These, people, are, called, refugees, or, internally, displaced, persons., This, is, their, story., Millionsoulsaware.org, features, articles, to, raise, awareness, in, the, world., Awareness, is, the, starting, point, for, making, our, world, a, better, place, for, all., », According, to, the, 2006, World, Refugee, survey, conducted, annually, by, the, U.S., Committee, for, Refugees, and, Immigrants, (USCRI),, a, staggering, 33, million, people, worldwide, are, currently, uprooted, from, their, homes., Of, that, number,, 12, million, are, refugees, and, asylum, seekers, living, in, camps, in, countries, other, than, their, own,, and, 21, million, are, Internally, Displaced, Persons, (IDP),, an, official, designation, for, civilians, displaced, by, persecution,, armed, conflict, or, widespread, violence., They, do, not, fall, under, the, official, category, of, a, “refugee”, because, they, remain, inside, their, own, countries,, but, their, plight, is, just, as, dire., world, map, featuring, 700, refugee, camps, worldwide, total, refugees, 12,581,698., locations, on, map, are, estimates., data, source:, UNHCR, USCRI, says, that, Iraqis, are, currently, the, fastest, growing, refugee, and, IDP, crisis, group, in, the, world, with, nearly, 2, million, people, having, fled, the, country,, and, 1.7, million, internally, displaced., In, Sudan,, more, than, 5.3, million, people, left, their, homes, in, an, attempt, to, escape, the, genocide, by, the, government-backed, militia, in, the, western, part, of, the, country,, which, the, world, community, knows, as, Darfur., And, an, on-going, armed, conflict, in, Colombia, internally, displaced, 2.9, million, people., Those, are, just, three, “tips, of, the, iceberg”, in, a, long, list, of, countries, and, regions, impacted, by, this, human, tragedy., USCRI, statistics, show, that, 26, conflict-ridden, nations,, predominantly, in, Africa, and, the, Middle, East,, have, an, IDP, crisis., And,, since, new, and, emerging, conflicts, are, constantly, creating, a, new, wave, of, refugees, and, IDPs,, keeping, track, of, the, numbers, is, a, challenging, task., What, the, current, USCRI, figures, show, is, this:, The, Middle, East, has, the, highest, number, of, refugees, and, IDPs:, a, staggering, 4.2, million., Palestinians,, Afghanis, and, Iraqis, make, up, the, majority, of, the, uprooted, population., With, 3.2, million, refugees, and, IDPs,, Africa, has, the, second, highest, number., Refugees, from, Sudan, are, the, largest, group,, scattered, throughout, the, camps, in, various, countries., Almost, 2, million, refugees, and, IDPs, live, in, south, and, central, Asia,, with, over, 1, million, Afghanis, in, Pakistan, alone.,  , life, in, the, camps, When, people, flee, their, homesteads,, they, leave, behind, most, of, their, belongings., Sometimes, they, manage, to, grab, a, few, basics,, but, most, of, the, time, they, are, just, happy, to, escape, with, their, lives, intact., They, usually, end, up, with, thousands, of, others, in, a, settlement, that, can, stretch, for, miles., This, is, a, refugee, camp,, a, place, that, not, one, of, us, would, willingly, choose, to, inhabit., But, the, refugees, have, no, choice., Having, fled, conflicts, of, unimaginable, proportions, –, massacre,, genocide,, and, other, atrocities, -, they, are, relieved, to, have, found, a, safe, place., So, they, construct, tents, and, other, makeshift, shelters, from, whatever, materials, happen, to, be, available, --, sticks,, plastic, sheeting,, mud, and, stones., In, the, best, of, cases,, humanitarian, aid, agencies,, as, those, mentioned, above,, will, provide, the, basics:, food,, clean, drinking, water,, and, rudimentary, health, care., But, sometimes,, depending, on, the, local, political, climate, and, the, accessibility, to, the, camp,, weeks, could, go, by, before, help, arrives., That, is, more, than, enough, time, for, water-borne, diseases, such, as, cholera, and, dysentery, to, take, hold, and, spread, quickly, among, thousands, of, people, gathered, in, these, makeshift, settlements., The, hope, among, the, refugees, is, that, they, will, be, resettled, quickly, to, a, safe, place,, or,, even, better,, return, to, the, homes, they, had, left, behind., After, all,, a, refugee, camp, is, intended, as, a, temporary, solution,, not, a, permanent, residence., Unfortunately,, for, many, millions, of, people, that, is, not, the, case., perpetual, refugees, It, is, hard, to, imagine,, but, some, refugees, often, end, up, living, in, the, camps, for, much, longer, than, expected, because, they, have, no, safe, home, to, return, to,, or, cannot, be, resettled, in, other, countries, due, to, restrictive, asylum, policies, of, other, nations. , Aid, workers, call, this, protracted, stay , “warehousing,”, defined, as, “populations, of, 10,000, or, more, restricted, to, camps, or, segregated, settlements,, or, otherwise, deprived, of, basic, rights, five, years, or, more.”, Globally,, according, to, USCRI,, there, are, an, estimated, 7.8, million, people, who, fall, under, the, category, of,  “perpetual, refugees.”, At, over, 3, million,, Palestinians, top, the, list., They, have, been, in, camps, for, so, long, –, over, 50, years, --, the, UNHCR, does, not, even, include, them, in, their, overall, figures., And, over, 1, million, Afghanis, have, been, in, Pakistan, for, 26, years., Imagine:, generations, of, these, people, have, never, seen, their, homelands., There, is, one, lesson, we, can, draw, from, history:, as, long, as, there, have, been, wars, and, conflicts,, there, have, been, refugees., And, the, obvious, tragedy, is, that, we, have, not, learned, from, the, past., Seven, years, into, the, 21st, century,, millions, of, displaced, souls, still, have, no, homes, of, their, own., I, am, aware, Souls, made, aware:, ?/1,000,000,, forward, this, article:, Print, |, Email, |, Blog, |, MSN, |, Blog, url:, Your, name:, To:, More, information:, Wikipedia, Refugees, USCRI,
