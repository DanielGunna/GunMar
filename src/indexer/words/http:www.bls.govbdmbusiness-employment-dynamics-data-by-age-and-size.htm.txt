SEARCH, BDM, Research, Data, on, Business, Employment, Dynamics, by, Age, and, Size, Overview, The, Bureau, of, Labor, Statistics, has, developed, research, data, on, employment, dynamics, by, age, and, size., The, Business, Employment, Dynamics, program, currently, publishes, data, on, gross, job, gains, and, gross, job, losses, by, size, of, firm, and, age, of, establishment., The, new, data, provide, insights, into, job, flows, by, age, and, size, at, both, the, establishment, and, firm, levels., These, data, enable, users, to, compare, gross, job, flows, and, net, employment, changes, across, a, wide, range, of, business, organizations,, from, startups, to, small, and, young, firms, to, large, and, older, firms., The, new, annual, research, data, by, age, and, size, track, employment, changes, at, private, business, units, from, March, of, each, year., Gross, job, gains, are, the, sum, of, increases, in, employment, at, existing, units, and, new, jobs, at, opening, units., Gross, job, losses, are, the, result, of, contractions, in, employment, at, existing, units, and, the, loss, of, jobs, at, closing, units., The, difference, between, the, number, of, gross, jobs, gained, and, gross, jobs, lost, is, the, net, change, in, employment., Concepts, and, Methods, The, definitions, and, methodology, in, measuring, annual, gross, job, gains, and, gross, job, losses, are, similar, to, the, quarterly, measures., The, linkage, method, considers, all, predecessor, and, successor, relations, that, may, come, about, due, to, changes, in, ownership, and, corporate, restructuring, over, the, entire, year., At, the, establishment, level,, some, of, the, quarterly, job, gains, and, job, losses, are, offset, during, the, estimation, over, the, year., Therefore,, the, sum, of, four, quarters, of, gross, job, gains, and, gross, job, losses, are, not, equal, to, annual, gross, job, gains, and, gross, job, losses., The, net, change, in, employment, over, the, year,, however,, is, equal, to, the, sum, of, four, quarterly, net, changes, on, a, not, seasonally, adjusted, basis., The, formal, definitions, of, the, annual, Business, Employment, Dynamics, data, elements, are, as, follows:, Openings., These, are, units, with, positive, employment, in, March, of, the, current, year, following, zero, employment, in, March, of, the, previous, year., Expansions., These, are, units, with, positive, employment, in, March, in, both, the, previous, and, current, years,, with, a, net, increase, in, employment, over, this, period., Closings., These, are, units, with, positive, employment, in, March, in, the, previous, year,, with, no, employment, or, zero, employment, reported, in, March, of, the, current, year., Contractions., These, are, units, with, positive, employment, in, March, in, both, the, previous, and, current, years,, with, a, net, decrease, in, employment, over, this, period., Gross, job, gains., Gross, job, gains, include, the, sum, of, all, jobs, added, at, either, opening, or, expanding, units., Gross, job, losses., Gross, job, losses, include, the, sum, of, all, jobs, lost, in, either, closing, or, contracting, units., The, net, change, in, employment., The, net, change, in, employment, is, the, difference, between, gross, job, gains, and, gross, job, losses., The, net, change, in, the, number, of, establishments., The, net, change, in, the, number, of, establishments, is, the, difference, between, the, number, of, openings, and, the, number, of, closings., Data, Source, BLS, derives, Business, Employment, Dynamics, data, from, the, Quarterly, Census, of, Employment, and, Wages, (QCEW), database., The, QCEW, data, are, the, product, of, a, federal-state, cooperative, program., The, data, come, from, summaries, of, employment, and, total, wages, of, workers, covered, by, state, and, federal, unemployment, insurance., State, Workforce, Agencies, provide, this, information, to, BLS., The, state, agencies, compile, these, summaries, from, the, records, of, their, unemployment, insurance, programs., State, laws, require, most, employers, to, pay, quarterly, taxes, based, on, the, employment, and, wages, of, workers, covered, by, unemployment, insurance., In, addition, to, the, quarterly, reports,, employers, with, more, than, one, establishment, in, a, state, complete, a, questionnaire,, called, the, "Multiple, Worksite, Report.", The, report, provides, detailed, information, on, the, location, and, industry, of, each, of, the, employer's, establishments., BLS, also, conducts, an, Annual, Refiling, Survey, (ARS), on, approximately, one-third, of, businesses, to, verify, and, update, their, industry, classifications, and, addresses., As, a, result,, changes, in, the, industrial, and, geographical, compositions, of, the, economy, are, captured, in, a, timely, manner, and, reflected, in, BLS, statistical, programs., QCEW, employment, and, wage, data, in, first, quarter, 2014, included, 9.4, million, employer, reports, of, employment, and, wages., These, reports, are, based, on, the, employer's, location,, rather, than, where, the, worker, lives., The, Business, Employment, Dynamics, database, links, establishments, and, firms, in, the, QCEW, database, over, time, to, determine, whether, they, gained, or, lost, jobs., We, call, this, linking, of, an, establishment's, or, firm's, records, over, time, a, "longitudinal", link., Unit, of, Analysis, BLS, defines, an, establishment, as, an, economic, unit, that, produces, goods, or, services,, usually, at, a, single, location,, and, engages, in, one, or, mainly, one, activity., BLS, identifies, establishments, by, the, unemployment, insurance, and, reporting, unit, numbers., In, contrast,, a, firm, is, a, legal, business,, either, corporate, or, otherwise,, and, may, consist, of, one, or, several, establishments., BLS, determines, the, age, and, size, of, firms, based, on, establishments, with, the, same, owner., BLS, uses, the, employer, tax, identification, numbers, (EIN), as, a, proxy, firm, identifier, to, determine, the, owners, of, establishments., For, single, establishments,, firm, and, establishment, characteristics, are, the, same., The, establishment, is, the, unit, of, analysis, in, measuring, gross, job, flows., However,, we, use, information, about, establishments, and, firms, to, determine, their, age, and, size, and, report, gross, job, gains, and, gross, job, losses, by, age,, firm, size,, and, establishment, size., This, method, allows, BLS, to, provide, alternative, measures, of, age, by, size., Age, and, Size, Definitions, Age, The, age, of, an, establishment, is, the, difference, between, the, reference, period, and, the, first, time, an, establishment, reported, positive, employment., The, age, of, a, firm, is, classified, using, the, age, of, the, oldest, establishment, within, a, firm., Five, distinct, age, groups, are, available:, Less, than, 1, year, old, 1, to, 4, years, old, 5, to, 9, years, old, 10, years, and, older, All, ages, Size, BLS, uses, two, methods, to, determine, size:, base, size, and, average, size., The, base, size, is, employment, in, March, of, the, previous, year., The, average, size, is, the, average, of, employment, in, March, of, the, current, year, and, March, of, the, previous, year., Size, classes, for, openings, are, determined, by, their, employment, in, March, of, the, reference, year., The, establishment, size, is, the, employment, reported, for, a, single, establishment., The, firm, size, is, the, total, employment, from, all, establishments, reported, under, the, same, EIN., Eight, size, classes, are, available:, 1, to, 4, employees, 5, to, 9, employees, 10, to, 19, employees, 20, to, 49, employees, 50, to, 99, employees, 100, to, 499, employees, 500, or, more, employees, All, sizes, The, five, age, groups, and, eight, size, classes, produce, 40, age-by-size, categories., Research, Data, Series, Four, tables, are, available, for, each, of, the, 40, age-by-size, categories:, Table, 1:, Gross, job, gains, and, gross, job, losses, Table, 2:, Gross, job, gains, and, gross, job, losses, as, a, percent, of, total, employment, Table, 3:, The, number, of, establishments, by, direction, of, employment, changes, Table, 4:, The,
