television,, motion, pictures,, or, live, performance., The, collection, includes, manuscripts,, photographs,, video, and, film, materials,, and, an, oral, history, collection., It, is, the, first, collection, of, its, kind, at, an, academic, institution, devoted, to, exploring, the, nature, of, comedy, as, an, American, art, form, and, reflects, the, College's, view, that, examining, the, history,, sociology,, and, culture, of, comedy, represents, an, important, and, underrepresented, field, of, study., The, project, is, the, brainchild, of, Bill, Dana,, a, 1950, Emerson, graduate, with, a, distinguished, career, in, comedy, as, a, performer,, writer,, and, producer., Dana, and, Project, Manager, Jenni, Matz, conducted, interviews, with, a, veritable, “who’s, who”, of, comedic, history., More, than, 60, interviews, were, conducted, between, 2005, and, 2007, and, include, such, luminaries, as, Phyllis, Diller,, Dick, Gregory,, Don, Knotts,, Norman, Lear,, Bob, Newhart,, Tom, Poston,, Paul, Rodriguez,, Dick, Van, Dyke,, Betty, White,, and, Jonathan, Winters., You, can, read, excerpts, from, the, interviews,, browse, our, transcripts,, view, the, list, of, collections,, or,
