Photographs, Every, picture, taking, opportunity, allows, you, to, record, no, less, than, six, correct, exposures!, Perhaps, you, have, already, figured, it, out, after, reading, the, above,, but, if, not,, you, will, soon, know, that, most, picture, taking, situations, have, at, least, six, possible, combinations, of, f/stops, and, shutters, speeds, that, will, all, result, in, a, correct, exposure;, not, a, creatively, correct, exposure, but, a, correct, exposure., But, only, one,, sometimes, two,, of, these, combinations, of, f/stops, and, shutter, speeds, is, the, creatively, correct, motion-filled, exposure., Again,, let’s, review,, that, every, ‘correct’, exposure, is, nothing, more, then, the, quantitative, value, of, an, aperture, and, shutter, speed, working, together, within, the, ‘confines’, of, a, predetermined, ‘ISO’., For, the, sake, of, argument, we, are, both, out, photographing, a, city, skyline, at, dusk,, using, a, film, speed, of, 100, ISO, and, an, aperture, opening, of, f/5.6, and, whether, we, are, shooting, in, manual, mode, or, aperture, priority, mode, the, light, meter, indicates, a, correct, exposure, at, 1, second., What, other, combinations, of, aperture, openings, (f/stops), and, shutter, speeds, can, we, use, and, still, record, a, ‘correct’, exposure?, If, I, suggest, we, use, an, aperture, of, f/8, what, would, the, shutter, speed, now, be?, Since, we, have, cut, the, lens, opening, in, half, (f/5.6, to, f/8), I, will, now, need, to, double, my, shutter, speed, time, to, two, seconds, to, record, a, correct, exposure,, (1, sec, +, 1, sec=, 2, seconds.), On, the, other, hand,, If, I, suggested, that, we, use, an, aperture, of, f/4, what, would, the, shutter, speed, now, be?, Since, we, have, just, doubled, the, size, of, the, lens, opening, (f/5.6, to, f/4), I, will, now, need, to, cut, my, shutter, speed, in, half, (1/2, second), to, record, the, same, ‘quantitative, value, exposure’., Easy, yet, hard,, right?, For, a, refresher, on, these, terms,, take, a, look, at, Bryan’s, intro, article, on, Basic, Photo, Tips:, Aperture,, Shutter, Speed,, and, ISO., The, Equations, The, following, are, equivalent:, f/4, at, 1/2, second, f/5.6, at, 1, second, f/8, at, 2, seconds, f/11, at, 4, seconds, f/16, at, 8, seconds, f/22, at, 16, seconds, Add, them, up, and, what, have, you, got?, Six, possible, combinations, of, aperture, and, shutter, speeds, that, will, all, result, in, exactly, the, same, exposure., I, want, to, stress, the, word, ‘same’;, it, is, meant, to, mean, the, ‘same’, in, terms, of, quantitative, value, only!, Likewise,, if, we, find, ourselves, taking, an, outdoor, portrait, at, the, park, with, our, telephoto, zoom,, we, find, that, with, our, aperture, set, to, f/16, and, with, an, ISO, of, 100,, a, correct, exposure, is, indicated, at, a, shutter, speed, of, a, 1/125, second, (s)., If, I, suggest, we, use, an, aperture, of, f/8,, what, would, the, shutter, speed, now, indicate, as, a, correct, exposure?, If, you, said, 1/500s,, you, are, correct,, which, also, means, that, you, know, at, f/22, the, correct, exposure, would, be, a, 1/60s, and, at, f/11, 1/250s, and, at, f/5.6, your, shutter, speed, would, now, be, 1/1000s., Again,, why, all, the, ‘fuss’;, what, difference, does, it, really, make, which, combinations, of, apertures, and, shutter, speeds, we, use, as, long, as, the, meter, indicates, a, correct, exposure?, Knowing, that, every, picture, taking, opportunity, offers, you, no, less, than, six, possible, aperture/shutter, speed, combinations, in, and, of, itself, may, seem, immaterial,, but, when, you, consider, the, impact, of, the, creative, possibilities, influenced, by, the, shutter, speed, (freezing, actions,, implying, motion, or, panning), and, aperture, (a, great, depth, of, field,, or, a, background, of, muted, tones, and/or, out, of, focus, foregrounds), you, will, have, a, much, greater, appreciation, for, why, you, are, choosing, that, particular, shutter, speed, and, aperture, combination., The, reason, will, not, be, simply, because, you, want, to, record, a, correct, exposure,, but, rather, because, you, want, each, and, every, time, to, record, the, CREATIVELY, CORRECT, EXPOSURE!, The, difference, between, a, “correct, exposure”, and, a, “creatively, correct, exposure”, is, often, huge!, Let’s, take, a, look!, Let’s, pretend, we’ve, invited, ten, other, photographers, to, join, us, in, capturing, this, scene, and, we, break, into, three, groups:, One, third, of, the, group, shot, this, scene, at, f/11, for, four, seconds, Another, third, shot, the, scene, at, a, f/8, for, a, two, seconds, The, remaining, third, shot, the, scene, at, f/5.6, for, 1, second., You, know, what?, All, of, us, just, shot, the, exact, same, correct, exposure!, Even, though, each, group’s, f/stops, and, shutter, speeds, were, different,, the, end, result, was, the, same;, the, quantitative, value, of, each, group’s, exposures, are, the, same., It, doesn’t, matter, if, you, are, photographing, with, a, film-based, camera, or, a, digital, camera,, you, must, learn, and, embrace, a, simple, fact;, every, picture, taking, opportunity, offers, you, no, less, then, six, possible, aperture/shutter, speed, combinations., Why, must, you, know, this?, Even, though, each, group, has, the, ‘same’, exposure,, the, motion-filled, opportunity, that, each, group, captured, may, look, radically, different., Knowing, that, each, motion-filled, exposure, opportunity, offers, up, six, possible, combinations, is, a, start, but, knowing, which, one, of, two, exposures, best, conveys, or, capture, the, motion, before, is, the, key., Once, you, are, armed, with, this, knowledge, you, can, begin, to, fully, explore, the, truly, endless, road, of, creatively, correct, motion-filled, exposures!, Now, let’s, imagine, that, we, all, awoke, the, following, morning,, once, again, splitting, into, three, groups, and, we, all, head, into, a, flower, garden., All, of, us, are, armed, with, our, telephoto, zooms, and, we, are, going, to, record, correct, exposures, of, a, single, flower, bloom., One, third, of, the, group, shoots, that, lone, flower, at, a, correct, exposure, of, f/4, at, 1/1000s., Another, third, of, the, group, at, f/8, at, 1/250s., The, last, third, of, the, group, shot, that, same, flower, at, f/16, at, 1/60s., Fifteen, minutes, later, we, all, get, together, and, compare, results, and, guess, what?, Every, one, of, us, has, recorded, the, ‘same’, and, correct, exposure, in, terms, of, its, quantitative, value,, but,, each, group, also, recorded, a, visually, different, yet, correct, exposure., The, visual, difference, is, the, key, to, understanding, the, difference, between, a, correct, exposure, and, a, creatively, correct, exposure., Although, the, quantitative, value, of, each, exposure, was, the, same,, the, aperture, choices, were, different, and, therein, lies, the, visual, difference., Depth, of, field, increases, each, and, every, time, we, stop, the, lens, down, and, in, the, case, of, the, flower, composition,, the, smaller, apertures, recorded, a, greater, depth, of, field, than, did, the, aperture, of, f/4., Again,, the, exposures, taken, by, all, three, groups, were, the, same, quantitative, value, but, visually, they, were, quite, different, solely, due, to, the, aperture, choice., 7760652, 7760654, So, to, recap:, there, are, six, possible, aperture, and, shutter, speed, combinations, that, will, result, in, the, correct, exposure,, yet, only, one,, maybe, two,, is, in, fact, the, “creatively, correct”, exposure., It, is, that, one, creatively, correct, exposure, that, gives, you, the, precise, depth, of, field, you, were, hoping, to, achieve, or, that, one, creatively, correct, exposure, that, gives, the, the, precise, action, stopping, shutter, speed, or, the, precise, shutter, speed, that, guarantees, a, motion-filled, image,, e.g., the, cotton, candy, effect, often, seen, in, waterfall, compositions., Let’s, take, a, real, world, look, at, just, how, different, a, correct, exposure, is, versus, that, of, a, “creatively”, correct, exposure., Exercise, 1:, Flower, Composition, Head, outside, with, your, camera, set, to, 200, ISO, and, a, telephoto, lens,, say, a, 200mm,, and, frame, up, a, flower., Once, you, focus, on, the, flower,, shoot, six, correct, exposures,, each, one, using, a, different, aperture, and, shutter, speed., For, example,, with, the, aperture, set, to, f/4,, you, get, a, correct, exposure, indication, at, 1/1000s., Shoot, this, one, exposure, and, than, move, on, to, f/5.6, and, then, shoot, another, at, 1/500s,, f/8, at, 1/250s, and, another, at, f/11, at, 1/125, second,, f/16, at, 1/60s, and, finally, another, at, f/22, at, 1/30s., You, will, soon, see, that, all, six, exposures, are, correct, in, their, quantitative, value,, but, radically, different, in, their, “visual, weight”., Note, in, just, these, two, examples, where, the, first, image, was, shot, at, f/5.6, at, 1/500, second, and, the, second, image, shot, at, f/22, at, 1/30s., They, are, the, “same”, exposure, in, their, quantitative, value,, but, oh, my,, look, at, how, much, busier, the, background, is, in, the, correct, exposure, taken, at, f/22, versus, the, much, cleaner, and, more, isolated, flower, composition, of, the, correct, exposure, taken, at, f/5.6, at, 1/500s., 7760594, 7760621, 7760611, All, three, of, these, images, are, exactly, the, same, exposure, (Images, 3,, 4,, and, 5)., Their, quantitative, volume, of, aperture,, (light), and, shutter, speed, (duration, of, time), is, exactly, the, same,, yet, you, can, clearly, see, that, visually, they, are, each, different., All, three, photographs, were, taken, with, my, tripod, mounted, Nikon, D2X, and, 200mm, Micro-Nikkor, lens., Image, 3, was, taken, at, f/5.6, at, a, 1/500, second,, Image, 4, was, taken, at, f/11, at, 1/125s, and, Image, 5, was, taken, at, f/22, at, 1/30s., Again,, their, quantitative, values, are, identical,, which, is, to, say, that, the, volume, of, light, that, passed, through, the, lens, and, the, amount, of, time, that, light, was, allowed, to, render, an, image, on, the, CCD, or, film, was, the, same., When, I, composed, all, three, of, these, images,, they, looked, exactly, the, same, inside, my, cameras, viewfinder., Yet, when, I, reviewed, these, same, three, exposures, on, the, camera’s, digital, monitor,, they, were, clearly, different, and, that, difference, in, this, case, was, with, their, backgrounds., In, Image, 3,, the, background, is, limited, to, subtle, out-of-focus, tones,, color, and, very, few, shapes., In, Image, 4,, the, background, begins, to, offer, up, a, bit, more, information, in, both, shapes, and, sharper, tones, and, by, Image, 5,, it’s, ‘clear’, that, the, background,, consists, of, other, nearby, flowers, due, to, the, much, greater, defined, shapes, and, tones, that, are, presented., All, three, are, the, same, exposure,, but, as, is, often, the, case,, only, one,, and, sometimes, two,, are, the, “creatively”, correct, exposure., Use, of, Motion, When, capturing, this, simple, composition, of, an, S-curve, on, Interstate, 5, approaching, downtown, Seattle,, I, was, presented, with, six, possible, options, of, recording, a, correct, exposure,, three, of, which, you, see, here, (Images, 6,, 7,, and, 8)., In, terms, of, their, ‘quantitative, value’,, all, three, of, these, images, are, exactly, the, same, exposure,, BUT, one, can, clearly, see, that, they, are, vastly, different, in, their, creative, exposure,, with, the, creative, emphasis, on, the, use, of, motion., It, has, and, will, always, be, my, goal, to, present, motion-filled, opportunities, in, the, most, motion-filled, way, and, more, often, than, not, when, there, is, a, motion, filled, scene,, the, longer, the, exposure, time,, the, greater, the, motion, is, conveyed., In, our, first, example,, Image, 6, was, captured, at, f/4, for, 1/2s,, Image, 7, was, shot, at, f/8, for, 2s, and, Image, 8, was, shot, at, f/16, for, 8s., All, three, of, these, exposures, were, made, with, my, Nikon, D2X, and, Nikkor, 200-400mm, zoom, at, the, focal, length, of, 400mm,, mounted, on, tripod, with, my, ISO, set, to, 100, and, my, WB, set, to, Cloudy., 7760605, 7760601, 7760600, An, exercise, such, as, this, is, truly, eye-opening., The, next, time, you, head, out, the, door, to, shoot, city, lights, at, dusk,, there, won’t, be, a, lot, of, hesitation, on, your, part, about, using, the, slower, shutter, speeds,, since, by, this, example,, the, slowest, shutter, speed, exposure, had, the, best, effect., (I, am, assuming, that, you, prefer, the, third, image,, the, image, taken, at, f/22, for, 8s, and, just, so, there, is, no, confusion,, this, is, not, ‘bracketing’, since, they, are, all, the, same, exposure, in, terms, of, their, quantitative, value., I, will, cover, bracketing, and, other, issues, related, to, “where, should, I, take, my, meter, reading”, in, a, future, article)., Going, to, Extremes, with, Shutter, Speed, As, you, begin, to, digest, more, and, more, this, simple, rule, of, exposure,, it, will, soon, become, clear, that, the, need, to, pay, attention, to, what, aperture, choice, or, shutter, speed, choice, will, in, fact, lead, you, to, conclude, that, there, is, but, one, truly, creatively, correct, exposure, most, of, the, time, and, this, is, particularly, true, as, you, begin, to, notice, that, the, world, offers, up, an, unlimited, supply, of, motion-filled, opportunities., When, capturing, these, motion, filled, opportunities, you, will, find, yourself,, more, often, than, not,, on, either, end, of, the, shutter, speed, spectrum;, using, fast, shutter, speeds, to, freeze, the, action, in, crisp, sharp, detail, or, using, slow, shutter, speeds, and, the, resulting, blur, to, suggest, or, imply, the, motion, present., There, is, rarely, a, ‘middle, ground’, when, it, comes, to, the, motion-filled, world, and, with, that, in, mind,, it, won’t, be, long, before, you, discover, that, most, of, your, time, is, being, spent, on, action-filled, scenes, between, 1/500s, and, 1/1000s, OR, between, 1/4s, to, 8s., 7760597, 7760596, With, my, camera, and, 80-400mm, Nikkor, zoom, mounted, on, tripod, and, the, lens, set, to, 300mm,, I, captured, Image, 9, at, f/4, and, 1/500s., Image, 10, was, shot, at, f/22, and, 1/15s., Both, exposures, are, exactly, the, same, in, terms, of, quantitative, value,, BUT, quite, different, in, the, arena, of, ‘creative, exposure’., Note, how, at, the, wide, open, aperture, of, f/4, (Image, 9), the, splash, is, frozen, in, crisp, sharp, detail, but, at, f/22, (Image, 10), that, same, splash, is, much, more, ethereal., Recording, a, correct, exposure, will, always, be, your, responsibility,, so, why, not, make, it, a, point, to, make, the, most, deliberately, and, visually, compelling, ‘creative’, exposure, possible!?, Exercise, 2:, Motion-Filled, Exposures, One, of, the, best, lessons, I, know, of, is, one, that, I, have, offered, up, to, countless, students, over, the, years, in, my, on-location, workshops, and, at, my, on-line, photography, school, www.ppsop.net., It, is, a, very, revealing, lesson, and, not, surprisingly, will, lead, you, further, into, the, world, of, creatively, correct, motion-filled, exposures., Choose, a, moving, subject,, such, as, a, waterfall, or, a, child, on, a, swing, or, shoot, something, as, simple, as, someone, pounding, a, nail, into, a, piece, of, wood., With, your, camera, set, to, Aperture, Priority, Mode,, your, ISO, set, to, 100,, (or, 200, ISO, if, that, is, the, lowest, your, camera, offers), and, your, aperture, set, to, wide, open,, (f/2.8,, f/3.5, or, f/4), take, an, image, of, the, action, before, you., You, have, just, recorded, an, exposure, at, the, fastest, possible, shutter, speed, based, on, the, ISO, in, use,, the, light, that, is, falling, on, your, subject, and, of, course, your, use, of, the, largest, lens, opening., Now, stop, the, lens, down, one, full, stop,, (if, you, started, at, an, aperture, of, f/2.8, then, go, to, f/4, and, if, your, lens, starts, with, f/4, then, go, to, f/5.6), and, once, again, take, another, exposure, of, the, action, filled, subject., Repeat, this, each, time, with, the, aperture, set, next, to, f/8,, then, f/11,, then, f/16, and, finally, f/22., Each, time, you, change, the, aperture, by, what, is, called, a, ‘full, stop’,, your, camera, does, a, quick, recalculation, and, offers, up, the, ‘new’, shutter, speed, to, maintain, a, correct, exposure, and, since, you, are, stopping, the, lens, down, with, each, full, stop, change, in, aperture,, (making, the, hole, in, the, lens, half, as, big, as, it, was, before), your, shutter, speed, has, now, doubled, in, time, to, compensate,, or, in, other, words,, your, shutter, speed, is, becoming, progressively, slower., The, slower, your, shutter, speed, the, more, likely, it, is, that, your, action, filled, subject, before, you, is, showing, signs, of, ‘blurring’,, since, the, shutter, speed, is, too, slow, to, ‘freeze, it’., Conclusion, To, re-cap,, the, fastest, possible, shutter, speed, with, any, given, ISO, will, always, be, found, when, you, use, the, largest, lens, opening, and, the, slowest, possible, shutter, speed, (barring, the, use, of, any, filters), will, always, be, found, when, you, use, the, smallest, lens, opening., There, is, one, thing, I, hope, you, will, never, forget, after, reading, this, article:, correct, exposures, can, be, found, just, about, anywhere,, but, why, settle, for, just, a, correct, exposure, when, you, can, in, fact, record, a, truly, creatively, correct, exposure, each, and, every, time?, You, really, can, take, charge, of, your, own, creative, vision, when, it, comes, to, exposure!,

beginner,, but, I, really, enjoy, the, fact, that, I, can, (within, limits,, and, possibly, at, the, cost, of, noise), choose, aperture, for, depth, of, field,, time, for, motion, rendition, and, then, use, ISO, to, get, the, right, exposure., To, post, a, reply, Sign, In, November, 2,, 2010, at, 7:34, am, First, of, all,, i, think, this, is, a, very, clear, article, about, exposure, in, photography., Now, my, opinion., I, dont, know, if, it, is, correct, to, put, in, the, same, box,, "correct, exposure", and, "creative, correct, exposure"., The, first, is, based, on, numbers, from, a, machine, (the, exposure, meter)., The, second, is, based, on, something, more, subjetive,, as, to, put, it, at, a, rule, level, You, said, that, in, a, assumption, "...(I, am, assuming, that, you, prefer, the, third, image,, the, image, taken, at, f/22, for, 8s, and, just, so, there, is, no, confusion....., Please,, excuse, my, very, bad, english., Regards,, Carlos, To, post, a, reply, Sign, In, June, 13,, 2012, at, 7:24, am, This, is, a, very, good, article,, explaining, clearly, how, aperture,, shutter, speed, and, ISO, combine, to, form, an, exposure. , The, only, thing, I, tend, to, disagree, on, is, talking, about, "creatively, correct, exposure"., I, think, that, creativity, by, essence, can, not, be, "correct",, as, it, is, a, reflexion, of, the, mood, and, the, intent, of, the, photographer., In, other, words,, given, the, exact, same, scene,, two, photographers, can, choose, completely, different, exposure, settings, to, convey, different,, yet, equally, creative,, emotions., Othmane, Bekkari, -, http://obkphoto.weebly.com, To, post, a, reply, Sign, In, Sign, in, or, Sign, up, to, post, response, Sign, up, Don't, have, an, account?, Signup, free, now.,  Sign,
