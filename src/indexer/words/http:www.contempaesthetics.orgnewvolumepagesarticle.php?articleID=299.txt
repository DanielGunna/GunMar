Abstract, In, this, paper, I, argue, that, by, any, major, definition, of, art, many, modern, video, games, should, be, considered, art., Rather, than, defining, art, and, defending, video, games, based, on, a, single, contentious, definition,, I, offer, reasons, for, thinking, that, video, games, can, be, art, according, to, historical,, aesthetic,, institutional,, representational, and, expressive, theories, of, art., Overall,, I, argue, that, while, many, video, games, probably, should, not, be, considered, art,, there, are, good, reasons, to, think, that, some, video, games, should, be, classified, as, art,, and, that, the, debates, concerning, the, artistic, status, of, chess, and, sports, offer, some, insights, into, the, status, of, video, games., Key, Words, video, games,, technology-based, art,, gamers,, game, design,, game, designers,, narrative, art, 1., Introduction, In, a, Newsweek, article, from, March, of, 2000,, Jack, Kroll, argues, that, "games, can, be, fun, and, rewarding, in, many, ways,, but, they, can't, transmit, the, emotional, complexity, that, is, the, root, of, art."[1], Kroll's, article, sparked, a, series, of, angry, replies,, mostly, from, gamers, writing, for, industry, magazines, on, the, web,[2], but, the, controversy, was, not, confined, to, fan, culture, and, journalism., In, an, article, published, in, MIT's, Technology, Review, called, "Art, Form, for, the, Digital, Age,", film, scholar, Henry, Jenkins, criticized, Kroll, for, dramatically, underestimating, the, potential, of, video, games.[3], Outside, of, academia,, Kroll's, article, was, also, cited, in, an, amicus, brief, advising, the, Seventh, Circuit, Court, of, Appeals, on, a, case, regarding, an, Indiana, video, game, censorship, law.[4], The, extent, and, diversity, of, the, response, indicates, that, Kroll, hit, a, nerve,, and, it, is, worthwhile, to, dig, a, little, deeper, into, the, issue., Despite, the, cultural, prominence, of, video, games, and, technology-based, art,, philosophical, aesthetics, has, completely, ignored, the, area., Scholars, in, other, disciplines,, such, as, film,, have, taken, the, lead, in, the, conceptual, debate., This, is, unfortunate,, since, seldom, are, there, questions, in, the, philosophy, of, art, that, have, direct,, real, world, consequences., Philosophical, inattention, to, video, games, has, a, de, facto, effect, on, the, multi-billion, dollar, industry, by, inadvertently, making, hasty, censorship, attempts, easier., The, fact, that, philosophers, have, not, raised, the, question, of, whether, video, games, can, be, art, lends, credence, to, the, assumption, that, they, are, not., In, this, paper, I, argue, thatby, any, major, definition, of, art, many, modern, video, gamesshould, be, considered, art.[5], Typically,, one, advances, the, art, status, of, a, purported, art, form, in, a, deductive, fashion,, by, first, picking, a, favored, definition, of, art,, then, demonstrating, that, the, candidate, satisfies, the, sufficient, conditions, for, art, according, to, that, definition,, and, finally, concluding, that, the, art, form, in, question, is, art., Rather, than, defining, art, and, defending, video, games, based, on, a, single, contentious, definition,, I, offer, reasons, for, thinking, that, video, games, can, be, art, according, to, historical,, aesthetic,, institutional,, representational, and, expressive, theories, of, art., If, we, can, agree, that, all, these, theories, generally, track, our, intuitions, about, what, should, be, considered, art,, then, when, they, are, all, in, agreement, we, have, good, reason, to, think, that, we, have, successfully, picked, out, an, art, form., My, argument, proceeds, in, three, major, steps:, I, begin, with, a, brief, description, of, three, recent, games, that, have, received, extensive, praise, from, gamers, and, game, reviewers., I, then, attempt, to, situate, video, games, with, respect, to, larger, issues, about, art, and, games, by, assessing, the, relevance, of, arguments, about, the, aesthetics, of, sport, and, chess., Finally,, I, offer, a, host, of, reasons, why, some, video, games, should, be, considered, art, according, to, several, major, theories, of, art., Overall,, I, argue, that, while, many, video, games, probably, should, not, be, considered, art,, there, are, good, reasons, to, think, that, some, video, games, should, be, classified, as, art.[6], 2., Three, Candidate, Games, It, will, be, useful, to, give, a, brief, description, of, a, few, important, games, from, which, I, will, draw, key, examples., Max, Payne, (Remedy, Entertainment,, 2001),, Halo, (Bungie,, 2001),, and, Tom, Clancy's, Splinter, Cell, (Ubisoft,, 2002), are, three, recent, games, that, have, earned, significant, critical, acclaim., The, sophistication, of, these, games, indicates, the, promising, aesthetic, potential, of, the, purported, art, form., Max, Payne, (Remedy, Entertainment,, 2001), is, a, third-person, shooter,, a, game, where, the, camera, takes, a, perspective, from, slightly, behind, the, character,, allowing, the, player, to, control, the, direction, in, which, the, character, looks, and, moves., Max, Payne, is, a, noir-revenge, thriller, in, which, the, player's, avatar[7], is, a, rogue, cop, on, a, mission, to, avenge, the, death, of, his, wife, and, child., The, game, employs, first-person,, voice-over, narration,, like, many, works, in, the, film, noir, genre,, and, it, includes, periodic, graphic-novel, cut, scenes,, inserts, that, develop, the, narration, between, levels, or, major, sections, of, play., Although, the, cut-rateChandler-inspired, dialogue, and, voice-over, could, use, some, extensive, rewriting,, the, game, makes, a, great, effort, to, motivate, revenge-directed, anger, by, forcing, the, player, to, work, through, hallucinatory, flashback, episodes, in, which, Max, is, impotent, to, prevent, the, slaughtering, of, his, family., The, elaborate, plot,, complete, with, double-crossings, and, evidence, of, conspiracies, spiraling, out, to, the, highest, levels,, helps, to, evoke, classic, noir-inspired, dread., Halo,, the, most, successful, game, for, Microsoft's, X-Box, platform,, is, an, elaborate, science, fiction, adventure, set, in, an, artificial, world., The, game, mixes, play, modes,, moving, from, the, first-person, perspective, of, a, cyborg, warrior,, to, driving, and, flying, modes, of, play., Like, Max, Payne,, Halo, takes, over, 20, hours, to, complete., The, levels, (or, long,, goal-directed, segments, of, play), are, highly, integrated, with, the, narrative,, and, much, of, the, pleasure, in, playing, the, game, derives, from, slowly, uncovering, the, purpose, of, the, world, on, which, your, army, has, crash-landed., The, narrative, development, is, highly, sophisticated, for, a, video, game, and, involves, plot, twists,, double-crossing, and, surprise, introductions, of, new, characters., Splinter, Cell,, also, a, game, for, the, X-box,, is, renowned, for, its, graphics, and, life-like, character, movement., In, the, game's, jingoistic, narrative,, you, play, a, secret, operative, set, to, infiltrate, a, hostile, country., As, in, the, other, two, games, discussed,, Splinter, Cell, has, an, elaborate, narrative, that, is, tightly, integrated, with, the, game, play., It, is, a, third-person, shooter, but, requires, stealth-like, movements., Much, of, the, game, play, is, spent, waiting, and, hiding, in, suspense., The, game, features, a, complex, plot,, extremely, detailed, character, movements, and, elaborate, lighting, effects,, which, include, stunning, shadow, play, and, chiaroscuro., Splinter, Cell, is, a, highly, unified, effort, to, provoke, the, feeling, of, tension, one, has, when, sneaking, around, and, hiding, from, danger., These, three, games, represent, recent, trends, in, video, game, design, made, possible, by, increasingly, sophisticated, technology., All, feature, integrated, narratives,, graphics, nearing, photo-realism, and, elaborate, three-dimensional, worlds, with, rich, and, detailed, textures., I, do, not, claim, that, any, of, these, games, are, great, art,, but, they, are, all, adept, at, achieving, the, goals, they, set, for, themselves,, goals, of, provoking, specific, emotions, that, are, typical, of, similar, genres, in, other, art, forms., 3., Where's, the, Art?, In, order, to, determine, whether, video, games, are, an, art, form,, we, first, need, some, idea, of, where, the, art, might, lie., Video, games, combine, elements, from, narrative, fiction, film,, music, and, sports., They, are, arguably, an, art, or, sister, art, of, the, moving, image,, specifically,, a, form, of, digital, animation., The, code, is, like, musical, notation, that, is, performed, by, the, computer,, and, the, games, are, played, like, sports., As, we, shall, see,, the, debates, concerning, the, artistic, status, of, chess, and, sports, offer, some, insights, into, the, status, of, video, games., In, the, philosophy, of, sport,, David, Best, makes, a, distinction, between, sports, that, are, evaluated, aesthetically, (aesthetic, sports), and, those, that, are, not, (purposive, sports).[8], Although, we, may, say, that, a, baseball, pitcher, has, a, beautiful, arm, or, that, a, boxer, is, graceful,, when, judging, sports, like, baseball,, hockey,, soccer,, football,, basketball, and, boxing,, the, competitors, are, not, formally, evaluated, on, aesthetic, grounds., However,, sports, such, as, gymnastics,, diving, and, ice, skating, are, evaluated, in, large, part, by, aesthetic, criteria., One, may, manage, to, perform, all, the, moves, in, a, complicated, gymnastics, routine,, but, if, it, is, accomplished, in, a, feeble, manner, one, will, not, get, a, perfect, score., Best, argues, that, "an, aesthetic, sport, is, one, in, which, the, purpose, cannot, be, specified, independently, of, the, manner, of, achieving, it."[9], One, might, argue, that, such, sports, are, so, close, to, dance, that, they, are, plausible, candidates, to, be, called, art, forms., One, objection, to, calling, sports, such, as, diving, art, forms, is, that, they, are, competitive., If, this, objection, holds,, then, perhaps, video, games, are, not, art, works, either,, since, they, are, essentially, competitive., Competition, is, considered, inimical, to, artistic, creation, because, it, locates, the, purpose, behind, the, production, in, non-aesthetic, goals., However,, it, is, fairly, obvious, that, competition, does, not, deny, something, of, art, status., Greek, tragedies, were, explicitly, entered, into, competitions,, but, no, one, seriously, denies, that, they, are, art, because, of, their, competitive, provenance., One, can, compose, a, poem, with, the, intention, of, submitting, it, to, a, contest, without, its, ceasing, to, be, an, art, work., The, same, can, be, said, of, any, kind, of, art,, and, there, is, thus, no, reason, to, think, that, competition, is, incompatible, with, other, aesthetic, goals., One, might, argue, that, the, situation, is, somewhat, different, with, video, games,, since, they, are, experienced, competitively, and, there, are, no, uncontested, art, forms, where, the, audience's, experience, is, itself, competitive., This, line, of, objection, fails, to, account, for, the, competitive, aspect, of, the, plethora, of, fictions, that, are, centered, around, competitions., National, Velvet,, Sea, Biscuit,, The, Karate, Kid,, and, numerous, other, fiction, films, that, we, might, consider, art, encourage, the, audience, to, root, for, one, side, of, a, competition,, making, the, experience, of, the, fiction, competitive., If, one, takes, issue, with, my, examples,, any, suspense-generating, fictional, example, will, do., Does, Hamlet, cease, to, be, art, because, the, audience, is, encouraged, to, side, with, Hamlet, against, his, father's, killer?, One, might, respond, that, although, we, may, find, ourselves, rooting, for, a, fictional, character, in, a, novel,, play, or, film,, this, experience, is, far, different, from, that, of, rooting, for, our, own, success, in, a, game., The, objection, may, conclude, that, being, involved, in, a, competition, precludes, aesthetic, experience;, however,, this, objection, is, beside, the, point., We, should, not, confine, the, audience, of, video, games, to, players,, since, often, games, are, played, with, an, audience., There, is, no, radical, difference, here, between, video, games, and, dance, contests, or, poetry, slams., Although, playing, video, games, usually, involves, a, smaller, audience-to-competitor, ratio,, there, is, no, reason, why, the, audience, watching, someone, play, a, game, must, be, smaller, than, the, audience, of, non-competitors, at, a, poetry, slam., Nevertheless,, we, should, not, ignore, the, aesthetic, experience, of, the, performers, of, art, works., The, video, game, player, can, plausibly, be, considered, a, performer, in, a, larger, video, game, performance., Since, the, primary, goal, of, most, game, design, is, to, enhance, such, aesthetic, experiences,, it, would, seem, that, we, have, good, reason, to, evaluate, games, as, art, works., Unfortunately,, the, philosophy, of, art, and, aestheticians, appear, oblivious, to, the, aesthetic, experience, of, performers, of, art, works., However,, we, must, ask,, does, not, even, the, amateur, musician, have, aesthetic, or, artistic, experiences?, Though, video, games, share, a, competitive, aspect, with, sports,, the, comparison, between, sports, that, may, be, art, and, video, games, does, not, bring, to, light, any, other, important, similarities., Indeed,, video, games, and, art-candidate, sports, are, different, in, an, important, way., Unlike, sports, that, are, evaluated, on, aesthetic, grounds,, the, playing, of, video, games, has, not, been, considered, an, art, form., It, is, true, that, recordings, of, game, play, have, been, taken, and, pieced, together, to, make, digital, video, art., In, addition,, some, games, allow, the, player, to, save, and, distribute, instant, replays., However,, the, performance, of, a, video, game, is, not, normally, evaluated, aesthetically., Perhaps, someone, will, make, an, argument, that, playing, a, particular, video, game, is, an, art,, but, I, do, not, wish, to, make, such, a, claim, here., A, player, can, be, evaluated, for, a, form, of, athletic, quickness,, but, not, usually, for, grace, or, other, aesthetically, relevant, features, of, play., Surprisingly,, this, is, not, the, case, in, a, chess, performance., A, similar, question, has, arisen, regarding, the, artistic, status, of, chess.[10], Some, consider, chess, to, be, an, art, form,, much, like, the, aesthetically, evaluated, sports., One, might, think, it, is, difficult, to, call, chess, art, and, exclude, things,, such, as, crossword, puzzles,, that, we, do, not, normally, consider, art, works;, however,, insofar, as, crossword, puzzles, only, possess, one, solution,, there, is, no, such, thing, as, an, elegant, or, otherwise, aesthetically, qualified, property, of, their, solution., There, are, two, primary, reasons, why, someone, might, argue, that, chess, is, an, art, form., In, major, competitions,, there, are, often, two, prizes:, one, for, the, winner, and, one, for, the, best, game., The, best, game, is, determined, in, part, by, the, elegance, of, moves,, the, originality, of, solution, and, the, difficulty, of, play., Whether, this, earns, chess, the, status, of, art, has, centered, around, the, question, of, whether, elegance, is, a, goal, of, the, players., Even, if, it, is, not, a, primary, goal,, one, can, argue, that, elegance, and, simplicity, play, a, role, in, the, choice, of, moves., Perhaps, the, aesthetics, of, a, move, serve, as, heuristics, that, optimize, selection., If, this, is, the, case,, then, aesthetic, concerns, can, become, part, of, mastery, of, the, game, itself,, adding, support, to, the, idea, that, playing, chess, is, an, art, form., In, addition, to, judgments, of, the, most, beautiful, game,, end-game, solutions, are, often, evaluated, for, their, formal, simplicity, and, elegance., This, is, a, more, controversial, basis, for, calling, chess, an, art,, since, if, end, games, should, be, considered, art,, then, logical, and, mathematical, proofs, would, become, candidates., As, stated, previously,, unlike, chess, and, gymnastics,, the, playing, of, video, games, has, not, been, proposed, as, a, candidate, for, art, status., One, reason, that, video, game, play, is, not, considered, an, artistic, performance, is, that, video, games, are, numerous, and, the, technology, has, changed, rapidly, over, the, last, few, decades., As, such,, there, is, no, one, video, game, around, which, players, have, focused, on, for, extended, periods, of, time., Though, video, games, appear, to, be, performative,, what, might, count, as, the, performance--the, playing--is, not, considered, art., Perhaps, this, is, because, the, games, themselves, draw, more, attention, than, the, players., Unlike, video, games,, non-electronic, games, such, as, poker, and, football, are, just, rules, of, play:, they, describe, penalties, and, goals., Electronic, games, are, different, in, that, they, are, much, more, than, rules:[11], They, include, narratives,, graphic, design,, characterization,, dialogue, and, more., Having, looked, at, the, relevance, of, the, aesthetics, of, chess, and, sport,, we, are, in, a, better, position, to, understand, where, the, art, of, video, games, might, lie., Unlike, chess, and, sport,, the, art, is, not, only, in, the, playing;, as, in, film,, the, type, of, art, that, should, concern, us, in, video, games, involves, not, the, playingbut, the, making., 4., Video, Game, Art:, A, Historical, Narrative, Today,, the, question, "Is, it, art?", arises, most, commonly, in, response, to, single, art, works, whose, art, status, is, in, dispute., Noel, Carroll, has, offered, a, compelling, account, of, how, such, disputes, can, be,, should, be, and, are, resolved., He, advocates, a, narrative, approach, to, resolving, such, disputes,, whereby, a, candidate, artwork, is, assessed, by, whether, a, story, can, be, told, linking, the, problems, and, goals, of, recognized, artists, at, a, previous, period, to, those, of, the, artists, whose, work, is, in, question., Although, we, seldom, have, an, opportunity,, the, narrative, historical, account, can, be, also, applied, to, art, forms, or, representational, systems, as, a, whole., I, will, attempt, to, provide, a, brief, sketch,, that, could, be, fleshed, out, into, a, more, comprehensive, story,, of, the, relationship, between, video, games, and, other, mass, art, forms., Advances, in, computer, technology, over, the, last, 40, years, provided, the, means, whereby, artists, could, attempt, to, solve, a, recurrent, problem, at, the, heart, of, modernism:, How, to, involve, the, audience, in, the, art, work?, Those, working, in, theater, and, performance, arts, experimented, with, happenings, and, participatory, theatre,, trying, to, bring, the, audience, into, the, performance., However,, the, problem, was, more, difficult, for, artists, working, in, film, and, literature,, where, we, find, novelistic, experiments, such, as, Cortazar's, Hopscotch, struggling, with, the, limitations, of, the, medium., Video, games, allowed, artists, to, tackle, a, more, difficult, sub-problem, facing, non-performed, arts,, the, problem, of, how, to, involve, the, audience, in, mechanically, reproduced, art., In, the, last, chapter, of, Principles, of, Art,, Collingwood, complains, that, mechanically, reproduced, art, is, essentially, flawed, because, the, medium, of, transmission, prohibits, art, works, from, being, "concreative.", Collingwood, argues, that, in, mechanically, reproduced, art:, "The, audience, is, not, collaborating,, it, is, only, overhearing., The, same, thing, happens, in, the, cinema, where, collaboration, as, between, author, and, producer, is, intense,, but, as, between, this, unit, and, the, audience, nonexistent., Performances, on, the, wireless, have, the, same, defect., The, consequence, is, that, the, gramophone,, the, cinema,, and, the, wireless, are, perfectly, serviceable, as, vehicles, of, amusement, or, of, propaganda,, for, here, the, audience's, function, is, merely, receptive, and, not, concreative;, but, as, vehicles, of, art, they, are, subject, to, all, the, defects, of, the, printingpress, in, an, aggravated, form."[12], This, is, the, first, and, only, time, Collingwood, uses, the, term, "concreative", in, The, Principles, of, Art,, and, just, as, Collingwood, himself, left, the, notion, somewhat, unexplained,, concreativity, has, been, almost, completely, ignored, in, the, philosophy, of, art.[13], In, A, Philosophy, of, Mass, Art,, Noel, Carroll, makes, one, of, the, few, contemporary, references, to, Collingwood's, term.[14], Carroll, sees, Collingwood's, criticisms, of, non-concreative, art, as, one, species, of, the, passivity, charge, against, mass, art,, the, claim, that, mass, art, is, inherently, defective, because, it, reduces, the, audience, to, mindless, drones,, thereby, prohibiting, the, free, play, of, the, imagination, that, genuine, art, provokes., On, this, reading,, Collingwood, is, complaining, that, the, audience, is, made, a, mere, receptacle, by, mass, art, and, that, mass, art, is, defective, by, virtue, of, its, pacifying, effect., Although, this, may, be, part, of, Collingwood's, criticism,, I, think, his, emphasis, lies, elsewhere., Rather, than, criticizing, mass, art, for, its, pacifying, effect, on, the, audience,, Collingwood, is, diagnosing, what, he, sees, as, a, source, of, limitation, on, the, expressive, potential, of, mechanically, reproduced, art., It, is, not, the, art, work's, supposed, deleterious, effects, on, the, audience, that, is, at, issue, but, the, inability, of, the, audience, to, provide, feedback, to, help, the, artist, create, the, most, effective, work, possible., On, my, reading,, Collingwood, is, pointing, out, a, feature, of, mass, art, that, Walter, Benjamin, noticed, in, "The, Work, of, Art, in, the, Age, of, Mechanical, Reproduction,", written, in, 1935,, three, years, earlier, than, the, publication, of, The, Principles, of, Art., Benjamin, argues, that, in, mechanically, reproduced, art, the, potential, opens, up, for, the, art, work, to, fall, out, of, step, with, the, audience,, losing, its, immersive, grip, and, thereby, providing, conditions, likely, to, spark, a, critical, attitude., He, says,, "the, film, actor, lacks, the, opportunity, of, the, stage, actor, to, adjust, to, the, audience, during, his, performance,, since, he, does, not, present, his, performance, to, the, audience, in, person., This, permits, the, audience, to, take, the, position, of, a, critic."[15], Rather, than, playing, up, the, supposed, politically, liberating, potential, of, this, limitation, of, mechanically, reproduced, art,, Collingwood, laments, the, handicap.[16], We, often, hear, it, said, that, films, can, "break, the, fourth, wall", through, techniques, such, as, directly, addressing, the, audience,, but, the, wall, remains., It, is, ontologically, impossible, for, the, audience, of, a, film, to, break, the, wall., Video, game, technology, has, allowed, artists, to, experiment, with, solutions, to, the, problem, of, how, to, make, an, interactive, movie:, Video, games, are, the, first, concreative, mass, art., 5., Video, Games, and, Every, Major, Theory, of, Art, In, this, section,, I, argue, that, according, to, most, major, theories, of, art,, many, video, games, should, be, considered, art., I, do, not, offer, detailed, definitions, of, each, theory, of, art,, since, every, theory, has, various, contentious, formulations,, the, major, variations, are, familiar, to, most, readers,, and, to, outline, in, detail, the, specifics, of, every, theory, would, require, much, more, space., Instead, I, operate, with, informal, glosses, of, the, theories, that, are, adequate, for, my, purpose., As, the, classical, film, theorists, focused, on, the, relationship, between, cinema, and, photography, and, theatre,, one, may, think, that, the, best, way, to, approach, video, game, art, is, to, find, its, differentiating, features, with, a, similar, art, form., In, the, case, of, video, games,, the, sister, art, is, cinema., However,, in, defending, the, art, status, of, games,, the, opposite, may, be, more, useful:, Examining, just, how, close, video, games, are, to, animation, and, digital, cinema, may, be, more, productive., Almost, anything, said, about, video, games, is, controversial., Some, game, developers, even, scoff, at, the, idea, that, video, games, are, an, art,, as, do, certain, filmmakers,, even, distinguished, ones., Theorists, who, call, themselves, ludologists, argue, that, video, games, should, not, be, considered, just, another, narrative, art, form,, but, a, form, of, play., Other, theorists,, narratologists, such, as, Janet, Murray,, argue, that, video, games, can, and, should, become, more, narrative-driven, in, order, to, realize, their, artistic, potential., This, seems, to, be, the, path, game, developers, have, chosen., Current, video, games, have, highly, integrated, narratives, that, are, often, far, more, complex, than, the, most, sophisticated, noir, plots., Even, if, you, can, remember, the, details, of, "The, Big, Sleep", (Howard, Hawks,, 1946),, you, will, never, be, able, to, recount, the, details, of, most, modern, games., As, mentioned, previously,, many, narrative, games, can, take, upwards, of, 20, hours, to, complete., For, the, past, decade,, there, has, been, a, moderate, amount, of, influence, between, film, and, video, games., Although, most, of, them, are, awful,, several, films, have, been, made, based, on, video, games., More, commonly,, video, games, are, made, based, on, film, subjects., Many, readers, of, this, article, will, think, of, PacMan, or, Pong, when, they, hear, of, video, games., If, so,, then, the, possibility, of, creating, a, narrative, film, on, a, video, game, story, should, sound, surprising., As, my, examples, indicate,, recent, games, are, far, more, complex, than, PacMan;, they, often, involve, complex, stories, and, characterization., For, those, who, have, not, played, heavily, narrative-integrated, games,, the, possibility, of, basing, a, narrative, of, whatever, sophistication, on, a, game, should, indicate, the, level, of, narrative, complexity, already, to, be, found, in, the, medium., Game, designers, often, try, to, make, their, games, look, more, like, film, by, including, cut, scenes, and, imitating, other, cinematic, features., Most, narrative-driven, games, are, heavily, interspersed, with, full-motion, video, sequences, called, cut-scenes., The, game, called, Splinter, Cell, is, typical., In, this, game,, cut, scenes, are, encountered, frequently, on, various, missions., After, major, events, and, before, new, episodes,, a, cut-scene, will, be, introduced, to, indicate, the, goals, of, the, level, and, the, objects, for, which, one, should, be, on, the, lookout., In, addition, to, including, these, small, digital, movies,, games, often, attempt, to, emulate, the, look, of, film., In, the, popular, game, Halo,, for, example,, if, you, look, up, towards, the, sun,, the, glare, produces, nested, circles,, as, if, the, player, is, controlling, a, movie, camera., This, is, inconsistent, with, the, perspective, of, the, player, who, is, not, looking, through, a, camera,, but, the, reference, to, cinema, is, intended, to, enhance, the, realism,, as, if, the, game, were, a, documentary., Such, techniques, are, clear, examples, of, game, designers, trying, to, situate, their, work, in, the, tradition, of, cinema., For, such, reasons,, any, historical, theory, of, art, that, admits, film, as, an, art, form, would, most, plausibly, admit, video, games., Through, repeated, allusions, and, attempts, at, emulating, the, moving, image,, game, designers, intend, that, we, appreciate, their, games, as, we, do, digital, animation, and, video, art., Modern, video, game, designers, are, deeply, concerned, with, traditional, aesthetic, considerations, familiar, to, animators,, novelists,, set, designers, for, theater, productions, and, art, directors, for, films., The, development, of, game, environments, is, an, intensive, process, involving, the, creation, of, level, maps,, lighting, sources,, setting, detail, and, visual, texture, complexity., As, the, author, of, a, realist, novel, or, the, set, designer, of, a, film, might, place, props, in, a, room,, level, designers, aim, for, the, consistent, incorporation, of, details, to, flesh, out, the, world, of, the, game., Character, movement, is, another, area, of, design, in, which, video, game, designers, share, goals, with, animators., For, example,, the, designers, of, Splinter, Cell, carefully, created, hand-animated, movement, studies, for, the, player-character, to, add, richness, and, a, life-like, feel, to, the, textures., From, set, design, to, lighting, techniques,, games, largely, draw, upon, the, aesthetic, toolkit, available, to, filmmakers., Any, aesthetic, theory, of, art, that, acknowledges, the, art, status, of, animation, would, also, recognize, many, contemporary, video, games,, since, the, intentions, of, the, creators, and, the, variety, of, aesthetic, experience, the, two, art, forms, admit, overlap, considerably., A, strong, case, can, also, be, made, for, video, games, on, institutional, grounds,, since, there, is, a, developing, art, world, for, video, games., Over, the, past, decade,, there, has, been, a, variety, of, museum, exhibits, of, video, games,, ranging, from, technological, development, lessons, to, explorations, of, the, influence, of, video, games, on, digital, art,, as, well, as, stand-alone, exhibits, of, the, emerging, art, form., Although, not, exactly, an, art, museum,, from, June, 6,, 1989, to, May, 20,, 1990,, the, American, Museum, of, the, Moving, Image, featured, a, show, called, "Hot, Circuits:, A, Video, Arcade", that, brought, a, collection, of, arcade, games, for, visitors, to, play, first, hand., The, show, traveled, to, 10, other, locations, throughout, the, country, from, June, 1990, to, September, 2003., Since, this, show,, the, museum, has, had, several, other, major, video, game, exhibits, and, has, almost, always, had, a, video, game, exhibition, on, display., In, July, 2001,, the, San, Francisco, Museum, of, Modern, Art, hosted, a, symposium, entitled, "ArtCade:, Exploring, the, Relationship, Between, Video, Games, and, Art,", where, recent, video, game-inspired, artworks, were, presented, alongside, a, selection, of, video, games, from, the, 1970s, to, the, present.[17], In, the, same, year,, over, a, dozen, art, exhibits, featured, video, game-related, art, work., Video, games, are, appreciated, as, both, art, forms, in, their, own, right, and, astools, for, the, creation, of, art, works, such, as, "Machinema", or, the, video, loops, of, digital, artists, who, use, clips, from, games, to, construct, avant-garde, video, art., In, the, spring, of, 2001,, the, Whitney, Museum, of, American, Art, housed, a, video, game-art, exhibit, called, "BitStreams,", which, featured, video, game-influenced, works., Recent, biennials, have, also, incorporated, interactive, digital, artworks,, and, video, games, and, digital, art, are, a, growing, presence, in, museums., Not, only, are, video, games, gaining, recognition, from, museums, of, art,, fine, arts, programs, are, springing, up, focused, on, the, graphic, aspects, of, video, game, design., MIT,, NYU,, Carnegie, Mellon, and, CalArts, all, have, programs, concentrating, on, entertainment, technology,, and, the, University, of, California, at, Irvine, is, creating, a, MFA, program, devoted, to, interactive, media., Georgia, Tech, recently, created, a, PhD, in, interactive, media, that, merges, communication, studies, and, computer, science., Outside, of, art, world, and, academic, contexts,, video, games,, like, other, mass, art, forms,, are, the, subject, of, popular, aesthetic, evaluation., In, December, of, 2002,, the, National, Network,, a, unit, of, MTV, networks,, announced, that, it, would, be, creating, an, awards, show, dedicated, to, video, games., The, show, will, offer, awards, for, categories, such, as, best, villain, and, best, movie, adaptation., A, digital, cable, channel, devoted, to, video, games, called, G4, was, launched, in, 2003.[18], Several, newspapers,, including, the, Village, Voice, and, the, New, York, Times, have, started, publishing, game, reviews., The, web, site, www.metacritic.com, posts, summaries, of, reviews, for, three, popular, art, forms:, movies,, video, games, and, popular, music., The, institutional, credibility, for, attributing, art, to, video, games, is, improving., There, is, clearly, a, burgeoning, art, world, for, videogames,, and, one, need, not, wait, for, every, modern, art, museum, in, the, country, to, feature, a, dedicated, exhibit, before, feeling, comfortable, in, calling, video, games, an, art, form., As, indicated, by, the, ties, between, animation, and, video, game, design,, a, persuasive, story, can, be, told, that, links, the, goals, and, features, historically, attributed, to, art, works, to, those, of, video, games., Much, like, film, production,, game, design, is, an, expensive,, collaborative, project., Several, groups, within, the, production, process, pursue, aesthetic, goals, common, to, other, arts., There, are, also, video, game, auteurs, who, imprint, a, creative, stamp, on, a, series, of, games, that, show, artistic, distinction., Shigeru, Miyamoto,, the, designer, of, "Mario, Brothers,", "The, legend, of, Zelda", and, other, popular, games, for, Nintendo,, is, considered, the, Eisenstein, of, video, games., He, is, the, subject, of, several, popular, articles, and, is, often, a, hero, in, books, devoted, to, the, history, of, video, games., Miyamoto, is, praised, for, his, ability, to, create, original, stories,, characters, and, the, look, behind, captivating, and, complex, games., Today, there, are, hundreds, of, game, designers, working, with, programmers,, producers,, level, designers,, dialogue, and, script, writers,, balancers, who, adjust, difficulty, to, skill, and, a, variety, of, other, specialists, who, contribute, to, a, finished, game., In, addition, to, the, similarity, between, film, directors, and, game, designers,, the, history, of, video, games, can, be, tied, to, other, arts., Much, as, film, grew, out, of, photography, and, drama,, video, games, grew, out, of, digital, animation., Beyond, the, goals, of, verisimilitude,, games, share, narrative, themes, and, expressive, goals, with, the, history, of, Western, literature, and, theater., In, the, Seventh, Circuit, Court, decision, for, American, Amusement, Machine, v., Kendrick,, Richard, Posner, argues, that, the, video, game, should, be, considered, an, art, form,, since, it, shows, thematic, and, expressive, continuity, with, herald, literature, and, is, at, least, as, effective, as, much, in, the, popular, arts, that, is, considered, protected, speech., Posner, defends, what, is, considered, by, most, standards, a, mediocre, game:, "Take, once, again, "The, House, of, the, Dead.", The, player, is, armed, with, a, gun--most, fortunately,, because, he, is, being, assailed, by, a, seemingly, unending, succession, of, hideous, axe-wielding, zombies,, the, living, dead, conjured, back, to, life, by, voodoo., The, zombies, have, already, knocked, down, and, wounded, several, people,, who, are, pleading, pitiably, for, help;, and, one, of, the, player's, duties, is, to, protect, those, unfortunates, from, renewed, assaults, by, the, zombies., His, main, task,, however,, is, self-defense., Zombies, are, supernatural, beings,, therefore, difficult, to, kill., Repeated, shots, are, necessary, to, stop, them, as, they, rush, headlong, toward, the, player., He, must, not, only, be, alert, to, the, appearance, of, zombies, from, any, quarter;, he, must, be, assiduous, about, reloading, his, gun, periodically,, lest, he, be, overwhelmed, by, the, rush, of, the, zombies, when, his, gun, is, empty., "Self-defense,, protection, of, others,, dread, of, the, "undead,", fighting, against, overwhelming, odds--, these, are, all, age-old, themes, of, literature,, and, ones, particularly, appealing, to, the, young.", Posner, clearly, sees, the, thematic, and, expressive, continuity, between, literature, and, a, mid-level, genre, video, game., Though, this, may, not, be, an, example, of, great, art, by, any, acceptable, standards,, nothing, inherent, to, the, video, game, rules, out, its, artistic, potential,, here, the, arousal, of, emotions, through, an, interactive, narrative., It, should, be, clear, that, a, strong, case, can, be, made, that, most, expressive, theories, of, art, would, have, to, include, video, games, if, they, include, film, and, literature., As, Judge, Posner, notes,, video, games, excel, when, they, are, about, struggle., Although, many, games, are, more, clearly, about, triumphant, victory, in, battle,, there, is, nothing, stopping, game, designers, from, creating, a, game, about, the, horrors, of, warfare., As, should, be, apparent,, current, narrative-based, video, games, can, easily, meet, neo-representation, theories, of, art, such, as, Danto's, "aboutness", criterion,, where, an, art, work, is, roughly, something, formally, appropriate, to, what, it, is, about., By, putting, players, in, the, position, to, make, decisions, affecting, the, lives, of, simulated, civilians, and, troops,, games, could, potentially, be, the, most, formally, appropriate, way, to, comment, on, war, via, a, fictional, representation., The, art, status, of, video, games, has, much, stronger, support, from, representational, theories, of, art, than, do, other, disputed, art, forms., In, The, Philosophy, of, Human, Movement,, David, Best, argues, that, there, is, a, crucial, difference, between, sports, and, art:, Sports, fail, to, meet, basic, representational, criteria., Putting, the, contrast, nicely,, Best, says, that, "whereas, sport, can, be, the, subject, of, art,, art, could, not, be, the, subject, of, sport., Indeed,, the, very, notion, of, a, subject, of, sport, makes, no, sense."[19], In, this, way,, the, distinction, between, sports, and, video, games, is, profound., As, such,, video, games, are, much, more, plausible, candidates, for, art, than, are, aesthetic, sports, or, chess., 5., Conclusion, In, this, paper,, I, provide, several, reasons, for, thinking, that, some, video, games, may, be, art., Clear, thematic, continuities, tie, video, games, to, the, history, of, western, literature,, and, games, share, expressive, goals, with, other, recognized, art, forms., Museums, and, art, programs, have, begun, to, incorporate, video, games, into, their, exhibits, and, curriculum, as, games, begin, to, achieve, recognition, in, the, art, world., Like, the, great, figures, we, expect, to, find, occupying, key, places, in, an, artistic, canon,, there, are, game, designers, who, have, reached, auteur, status., Similar, to, other, bourgeoning, art, forms,, there, is, a, quickly, growing, body, of, recognized, major, works, in, video, games., In, addition,, game, designers, have, used, the, medium, to, tackle, previously, unsolvable, artistic, problems, facing, film, and, literature,, linking, the, art, of, video, games, to, the, problems, facing, modernist, film, and, literature., Although, all, video, games, should, not, be, considered, art,, recent, developments, in, the, medium, have, been, widely, recognized, as, clear, indications, that, some, video, games, should, be, regarded, as, art, works.[20], Of, course,, the, status, of, an, art, form, is, never, decided, apart, from, its, products., Without, masterpieces,, arguing, that, video, games, can, be, art, seems, premature., "Max, Payne", and, "Halo", are, two, of, the, best, games, ever, produced,, but, they, are, not, great, art., I, expect, that, in, the, course, of, time, current, video, games, may, seem, as, artistically, insignificant, as, Lumière, actualités,, with, little, more, than, historical, significance., Perhaps, it, is, a, trivial, feat,, but, several, recent, games, have, reached, levels, of, excellence, that, exceed, the, majority, of, popular, cinema., The, potential, of, the, medium, seems, clear:, good, if, not, great, video, game, art, is, in, the, near, future.[21], Endnotes, [1], Jack, Kroll,, Newsweek,, March, 6,, 2000., [2], Numerous, web, pages, are, devoted, to, criticizing, Kroll., [3], Henry, Jenkins,, "Art, Form, for, the, Digital, Age", (Technology, Review,, September/October, 2000);, see, also, Henry, Jenkins,, "Games,, the, New, Lively, Art,", forthcoming, in, Jeffrey, Goldstein, (ed.),, Handbook, for, Video, Game, Studies, (Cambridge:, MIT, Press)., [4], See, the, IDSA's, (Interactive, Digital, Software, Association), amicus, brief, for, American, Amusement, Machine, Ass'n, v., Kendrick, (2000)., [5], A, set, of, necessary, conditions, for, something, to, be, a, video, game, might, look, like, this:, Something, is, a, video, game, only, if, (1), it, incorporates, a, visual, display, (2), allows, for, user, input, that, can, (3), change, aspects, of, the, visual, display,, (4), giving, the, impression, of, movement, (5), for, purposeful,, internally, indicated, progressive, action, (6), in, face, of, some, difficulty, (7), that, exists, apart, from, any, conventionally, (externally), established, rules, or, goals., [6], There, is, nothing, unusual, about, the, suggestion, that, some, video, games, are, art, and, others, are, not., We, make, a, similar, distinction, for, most, every, major, art, form., Many, do, not, consider, the, photographs, in, grocery, store, circulars, to, be, art,, but, most, think, some, photographs, are, art., Most, people, do, not, consider, the, jingles, in, commercials, to, be, art,, but, almost, everyone, considers, some, pieces, of, music, to, be, art., ., ., ., [7], The, player-controlled, characters, in, games, are, called, "avatars.",

There, is, only, a, handful, of, articles, on, the, chess-as-art, debate., I, provide, a, small, annotated, bibliography, in, this, note,, for, those, who, might, be, interested., In, one, of, the, earlier, articles, on, the, subject,, Harold, Osborne, argues, that, chess, can, be, considered, an, art, form, since, it, affords, the, possibility, for, the, creation, of, objects, of, intellectual, beauty., Harold, Osborne,, "Notes, on, the, Aesthetics, of, Chess, and, the, Concept, of, Intellectual, Beauty,", British, Journal, of, Aesthetics,, vol., 4,, no., 2., Rachels, argues, that, not, only, do, we, appreciate, chess, games, as, aesthetic, objects,, they, are, played, /, created, with, aesthetic, goals, in, mind., James, Rachels,, "Chess, as, Art:, Reflections, on, Richard, Reti,", Philosophic, Exchange,, 1984-5,, vols., 15&16,, pp., 105-115., Lord, argues, that, though, chess, games, may, be, objects, of, aesthetic, contemplation,, they, are, not, art, works., Museums, include, aesthetic, objects, that, are, not, art,, to, follow, the, institutional, theory, of, art, and, call, such, things, art, would, be, to, gerrymander, the, concept., Lord, endorses, something, like, an, expressive, theory, of, art., Catherine, Lord,, "Is, Chess, Art?", Philosophic, Exchange,, 1984-5,, vols., 15&16,, pp., 117-122., Humble, argues, that, chess, playing, should, be, considered, an, art, form., He, argues, that, the, competitive, aspects, can, contribute, directly, and, indirectly, to, the, aesthetic, value, of, the, game., Though, chess, may, be, an, art, form,, he, concludes, that, its, masterpieces, are, only, minor, art, works, in, the, grand, scheme, of, things., P., N., Humble,, "Chess, as, an, Art, Form,", British, Journal, of, Aesthetics,, vol., 33,, no., 1,, 1993., For, a, consideration, of, the, composed, chess, problem, as, art,, see, C., P., Ravilious,, "The, Aesthetics, of, Chess, and, the, Chess, Problem,", British, Journal, of, Aesthetics,, vol., 34,, no., 2,, July, 1994., Humble, offers, a, defense, against, Ravilious's, objections, that, he, should, have, talked, about, composed, chess, problems, rather, than, competition, chess, and, that, he, over, emphasizes, the, role, of, competition., P., N., Humble,, "The, Aesthetics, of, Chess:, A, Reply, to, Ravilious,", British, Journal, of, Aesthetics,, vol., 35,, no., 4,, 1995., [11], I, would, argue, that, video, games, are, unlike, other, formal, games, in, that, they, lack, rules, altogether., As, the, old, saying, goes,, "Rules, are, made, to, be, broken.", We, would, not, say, that, the, law, of, gravity, is, a, rule, governing, our, behavior;, rather, it, is, a, brute, physical, limitation., In, video, games,, the, supposed, "rules", are, much, more, like, physical, laws, than, rules, which, one, must, follow, or, face, penalty., In, a, video, game,, one, simply, has, no, choice., [12], R., G., Collingwood,, The, Principles, of, Art, (New, York:, Oxford, University, Press,, 1938),, p., 323., [13], In, Art, as, Experience,, John, Dewey, developed, his, theory, of, the, "esthetic", by, reference, to, certain, unified, and, complete, experiences, that, creatures, have, with, their, environments., He, calls, such, an, experience, "an-experience.", An, experience, only, becomes, "an-experience", for, Dewey, when, it, involves, doings, and, sufferings, and, is, marked, off, from, the, rest, of, our, experiences, as, unified, and, complete., One, might, say, that, Dewey, thinks, "esthetic", experience, is, best, had, from, interaction, or, interactivity,, and, that, anesthetic, experience, results, when, people, become, dominated, or, under, whelmed, by, their, environments., For, more, on, Dewey, and, anesthetic, experience,, see, Aaron, Smuts,, "Anesthetic, Experience,", Philosophy, and, Literature,, 29.1,, 2005,, pp., 97-113., More, remains, to, be, said, about, how, Dewey, reconciles, the, success, of, non-interactive, artworks, with, his, interactive, theory, of,
