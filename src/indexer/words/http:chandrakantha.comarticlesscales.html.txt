scale, forms, the, basis, of, all, music. , This, article, will, look, at, the, differing, concepts, of, scale, in, both, the, North, and, South, Indian, systems, of, music., It, is, well, known, that, Indian, music, is, based, upon, the, concept, of, seven, notes, (sapta, swar). , Theses, notes, are:, Shadj,, Rishabh,, Gandhar,, Madhyam,, Dhaivat,, and, Nishad;, yet, they, are, commonly, abbreviated, to, Sa,, Re, (Ri),, Ga,, Ma,, Pa,, Dha,, and, Ni. , The, positions, of, these, notes, may, vary, considerably,, therefore, there, should, be, a, way, to, describe, these, scales. , This, is, called, "mode", in, English,, "that", in, Hindi, and, "mela", in, the, south, Indian, languages., The, concept, of, that, or, mela, extends, back, to, Bharat's, time,, where, it, was, referred, to, as, "jati". , There, were, 18, jatis,, 11, of, which, were, said, to, be, mixed,, while, seven, were, called, "shuddha". , The, term, Shuddha, in, Sanskrit, means, "pure". , The, term, shuddha, was, applied, because, they, were, all, related, by, a, simple, process, of, modulation, known, as, "murchana"., Murchana, is, easily, understood, by, the, following, illustration. , We, see, that, if, we, start, with, a, scale,, in, this, case, Bilawal-Dhirashankarabaranam, (natural, scale),, we, may, produce, a, number, of, other, scales, by, simply, shifting, the, tonic. , This, fundamental, relationship, is, why, the, ancients, called, them, "Shuddha"., THE, PROCESS, OF, MURCHANA, (Modulation), Bilawal-Dhirashankarabaranam, Sa,   , Re,   , Ga, Ma,   , Pa,   , Dha,   , Ni, Sa,   , *,   ,

between, 1000ad, and, 1500ad. , The, process, of, relating, scales, by, murchana, (e.g.,, shuddha, jati), was, downgraded, and, the, process, of, relating, scales, by, an, alteration, of, the, internal, intervals, (e.g.,, mixed, jatis), was, adopted., This, shift, was, probably, precipitated, by, two, events. , First, was, the, fixing, of, the, interval, for, the, 5th. , We, see, from, the, previous, illustration, that, it, was, possible, to, have, a, "Komal, Pa", (i.e.,, diminished, 5th). , When, it, was, no, longer, acceptable, to, have, this, komal, pancham,, the, system, was, forced, to, change. , Another, disadvantage, of, this, system, was, that, after, modulation,, the, scale, would, have, to, be, slightly, retuned, because, the, intervals, on, each, position, were, not, exactly, the, same. , For, whatever, reasons,, the, process, of, looking, at, scales, as, a, function, of, internal, intervals, became, the, new, paradigm, for, Indian, musicologists., The, master, of, this, new, paradigm, was, Venkatmukhi, Swami, who, is, very, important, to, the, South, Indian, musicians. , In, 1660, he, published, his, Chaturdandiprakashika, in, which, he, outlined, his, system, of, 72, mela. , This, process, is, demonstrated, quite, simply, in, the, following, illustration. , We, see, in, the, chart, that, there, are, 6, permutations, of, both, the, lower, and, upper, tetrachords. , When, we, multiply, them, together, we, get, 36, different, combinations. , These, 36, are, then, doubled, by, the, use, of, tivra, ma, (augmented, 4th), to, yield, 72, different, combinations. , This, is, the, origin, of, the, 72, mela.,  , VENKATAMUKHI, SWAMI'S, APPROACH, TO, SCALES, Lower, Tetrachord,  , Upper, Tetrachord, Sa, Re, -, -, Ga, Ma,      , Pa, Dha, -,

Dha, Ni, -, -, Sa, Sa, -, -, Re, Ga, Ma,      , Pa, -, -, Dha, Ni, Sa, This, process, is, very, effective, in, providing, a, theoretical, base, for, south, Indian, music. , It, is, clear,, scientific, and, unambiguous. , However, the, situation, is, a, bit, different, in, the, North., Hindustani, sangeet, has, been, slow, to, develop, a, scientific, approach, to, scales. , It, would, seem, easy, to, simply, adopt, the, 72, melkarta, system;, unfortunately, this, is, not, so, easy. , We, see, in, the, previous, illustration, that, the, last, two, permutations, of, each, group, of, tetrachords, contain, chromaticisms, which, are, not, possible, in, the, Northern, system. , Therefore,, when, the, disallowed, permutations, are, removed,, we, get, 32, possible, scales, instead, of, 72. , This, 32, that, system, seems, to, be, the, clearest, approach, to, north, Indian, scales. , Unfortunately, it, is, seldom, used., Most, musicians, follow, the, system, laid, down, by, V.N., Bhatkhande. , To, his, credit, we, must, say, that, prior, to, his, work,, the, theoretical, system, was, even, worse. , It, was, dominated, by, archaic, concepts, of, rag,, ragini,, putra, rags, etc. , This, may, have, been, quaint, and, colourful,, but, it, was, worthless, as, a, scientific, system. , Bhatkhande, was, brave, enough, to, abandon, the, raga-ragini, approach, and, introduce, a, scientific, system, of, that, (i.e.,, mela). , Unfortunately, his, numbers, were, off. , He, seems, to, have, been, well, aware, of, the, 32, possible, modes, produced, by, the, previous, process,, however,, he, took, an, unfortunate, decision, in, his, treatment, of, unutilized, thats. , Whereas, Venkatmukhi, Swami, took, the, position, that, he, had, "discovered", new, melas,, Bhatkhande, took, the, view, that, these, thats, were, irrelevant, and, cast, them, out. , This, would, have, been, excusable, if, he, had, stopped, there,, but, unfortunately, he, continued, to, cast, out, thats,, even, some, in, common, usage. , Of, more, than, a, dozen, modes, in, use, during, his, time,, Bhatkhande, arbitrarily, decided, that, he, would, use, only, ten., The, consequence, of, this, arbitrary, decision, was, unfortunate. , Today, about, 20, modes, are, in, common, use,, but, music, teachers, go, through, the, futile, attempt, to, cast, the, rags, into, 10, scales. , Such, attempts, are, arbitrary,, unscientific, and, weaken, the, theoretical, background, of, the, average, music, student. , There, is, a, movement, in, many, places, to, rectify, the, situation. , It, does, no, great, violation, to, the, system, to, increase, the, number, of, thats,, and, this, is, exactly, what, many, musicologists, are, doing. , But, it, may, be, a, long, time, before, this, is, the, norm., This, article, has, shown, how, important, scales, are, in, Indian, music. , They, may, be, called, scale,, that,, or, mela, but, conceptually, they, are, all, the, same. , They, describe, the, character, of, the, seven, notes. , Over, the, last, few, millenniua,, India, has, seen, numerous, approaches, to, scales,, but, today, India, has, two. , There, is, the, north, Indian, system, based, upon, 10, thats, and, the, South, Indian, system, based, upon, 72, melas.,  ,  , This, page, last, updated, ©, 1998,, 1999,, 2000,, 2001,, 2002,, 2003,, 2004,, 2005,, 2006,, 2007,, 2008,, 2009,, 2010,, 2011,, 2012,,
