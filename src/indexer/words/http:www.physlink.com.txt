galaxies, seen, when, the, universe, was, only, eight, percent, of, its, current, age., Finding, the, 'Ghost, Particles', Might, be, More, Challenging, Results, from, the, NEOS, experiment, on, sterile, neutrinos, differ, partly, from, the, theoretical, expectations., Earth’s, Magnetic, Field, Reveals, Details, Of, A, Dramatic, Past, ESA’s, Swarm, satellites, are, seeing, fine, details, in, one, of, the, most, difficult, layers, of, Earth’s, magnetic, field, to, unpick, –, as, well, as, our, planet’s, magnetic, history, imprinted, on, Earth’s, crust., Scientists, Evade, The, Heisenberg,

Researchers, have, developed, a, technique, that, uses, light, to, get, two-dimensional, (2-D), plastic, sheets, to, curve, into, three-dimensional, (3-D), structures,, such, as, spheres,, tubes, or, bowls., The, Cat’s, Paw, and, Lobster, Nebulae, The, beautiful,, glowing,, cosmic, clouds, of, gas, and, dust, catalogued, as, NGC, 6334, and, NGC, 6357, now, have, new, names., Science, Facts, Neutrinos, to, the, Rescue, by Anton Skorucak, and, ScienceIQ.com, Have, you, ever, wondered, what, the, most, abundant, particle, in, the, universe, is, after, photons, of, light?, The, answer, is:, Neutrinos., These, tiny,, neutral, and, almost, mass-less, particles, that, move, at, almost, the, speed, of, light, hardly, ever, interact, with, anything, in, the, universe., In, fact, about, ten, thousand, trillion, neutrinos, will, pass, through, your, body, by, the, time, you, are, finished, reading, this., The, existence, of, neutrinos, was, predicted, by, Wolfgang, Pauli, in, 1930., After, observing, the, beta, decay,, a, process, where, a, neutron, (which, was, not, yet, discovered, at, the, time), from, atom's, nucleus, decays, into, a, proton, and, an, electron,, it, was, noticed, that, the, energy, just, did, not, add, up., Namely,, there, was, a, missing, amount, of, energy, that, was, a, threat, to, the, well-established, law, of, conservation, of, energy., Pauli, then, postulated, that, there, must, be, a, new, particle, which, was, not, seen, that, would, carry, this, missing, difference, in, energy., He, named, it, the, 'neutron'., This, name, did, not, last, too, long, since, in, 1932, James, Chadwick, actually, discovered, the, neutron., Fermi, then, renamed, it, a, neutrino,, which, in, Italian, means:, little, neutral, one., It, was, only, in, 1956, that, Clyde, Cowan, and, Fredrick, Reines, actually, detected, neutrinos, from, a, nuclear, power, plant, for, the, first, time., Most, of, the, neutrinos, in, the, universe, were, created, during, the, first, few, seconds, after, the, Big, Bang., Thanks, to, their, weak, interaction, with, matter,, most, of, those, neutrinos, are, still, around., Neutrinos, are, also, created, in, nuclear, power, plants, and, in, our, Sun, and, other, stars, where,, in, the, process, of, fusion,, four, protons, and, two, electrons, get, fused, into, an, atom, of, Helium, and, in, the, process, create, two, neutrinos., We, still, know, very, little, about, these, elusive, particles,, namely, that, their, mass, is, very, small, (smaller, than, that, of, the, electron),, but, we, don't, know, exactly, what, that, mass, is., We, also, believe, that, they, travel, at, or, close, to, the, speed, of, light,, but, again, we, are, not, sure, what, that, speed, is., Further, research, into, neutrinos, will, not, only, answer, these, questions, but, will, also, allow, us, to, peek, into, the, early, universe,, to, learn, about, the, formations, of, stars, and, explosions, of, supernovas., The, message, is, in, the, neutrinos., Sputnik, and, The, Dawn, of, the, Space, Age, History, changed, on, October, 4,, 1957,, when, the, Soviet, Union, successfully, launched, Sputnik, I., The, world's, first, artificial, satellite, was, about, the, size, of, a, basketball,, weighed, only, 183, pounds,, and, took, ..., continue, reading, this, fact, Lunar, Explorations, Ever, since, the, beginning, of, intelligent, life, on, Earth,, the, moon, has, been, a, focal, point, of, human, curiosity., Galileo’s, discovery, in, 1610, that, the, moon, had, craters,, valleys, and, mountains,, instead, of, the, ..., continue, reading, this, fact, Big, Fish, The, phrase, 'big, fish, eat, little, fish', may, hold, true, when, it, comes, to, planets, and, stars., Perhaps, as, many, as, 100, million, of,
