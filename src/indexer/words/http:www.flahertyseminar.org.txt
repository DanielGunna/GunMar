2017, The, closing, night, of, the, Flaherty, NYC, Winter/Spring, 2017 program,, Tracing, Touch, was, a, negotiation, with, the, fragility, of, our, bodies, and, a, deep, introspection, of, the, finitude, of, all, our, lives., The, two, films, explored, the, creative, processes, that, we, undertake, to, try, and, represent, the, final, certainty, of, death., The, program, was, a, site, of, engaging, with, and, creating, collaborative, artistic, processes, that, are, both, life, affirming,, yet, in, a, peaceful, agreement, with, the, predetermined, expiry, of, all, things, living., Programmed, by, Ruth, Somalo,, the, screening, was, followed, by, a, conversation, between, the, filmmakers, who, joined, us, on, Skype,, and, Flaherty, Board, of, Trustees, President, John, Bruce,, filmmaker,, strategist,, educator, and, designer., John, Bruce,, Ruth, Somalo, Eric, Stewart’s, Wake, directly, engages, with, the, material, ash, remains, of, Stewart’s, father., The, film, thereby, becomes, an, almost, ritualistic, process, of, engaging, with, what, remains, of, a, loved, one,, and, creating, a, reality, from, the, engagement, wherein, one, is, at, peace, with, the, memories,, and, has, created, a, way, of, living, with, the, vacuum, left, behind., Through, the, iterative, process, of, sitting, in, a, silent, dark, room, and, spreading, his, father’s, ashes, on, film,, and, constantly, watching, the, particles, move, and, settle,, Stewart, creates, a, bridge, between, a, space, that, is, so, private, and, a, world, outside, with, which, he, collaborates,, shares, and, recovers., Dispatch, Continued…, 0, 2017, Fall, Flaherty, NYC:, OUT, FROM, UNDER, –, April, 11,, 2017, The, Flaherty, is, excited, to, announce, our, Fall, Flaherty, NYC, series, will, be, programmed, by Maori, Karmael, Holmes, and, Charlotte, Ickes., The, series, OUT, FROM, UNDER, opens, on, Monday,, October, 2., OUT, FROM, UNDER, explores, labor,, environment,, spirituality,, and, exile, through, films, and, videos, that, are, keenly, interested, in, the, capacious, concept, of, “the, underground.”, Densely, layered,, these, subterranean, and, submarine, spaces, have, prompted, us, to, consider, intersecting, themes,, including:, the, underground/undocumented/unacknowledged, labor, of, immigrants,, women,, and, people, of, color;, the, sunken, spaces, of, the, Global, South,, including, the, Southern, United, States,, territorialized, and, devalued, as, ‘below’, or, ‘behind’, the, rest, of, the, world;, and, finally,, the, possibility, of, the, underground, as, a, space, of, confinement, as, well, as, liberation., A, supple, space, tense, with, imaginative, play,, alternative, world-making,, disruptive, actions,, displacement, as, well, as, containment,, the, earth, and, sea, below, serve, as, both, oppressive, enclosures, and, radical, openings,, products, of, and, unfettered, from, the, order, imposed, on, regulated, life, above, ground., Maori, Karmael,

Dispatch:, Flaherty, NYC:, March, 28,, 2017, –, March, 29,, 2017, The, fifth, program, of, Flaherty, NYC, Winter/Spring, 2017 program,, Tightly, Bound, Consciousness, was, an, evening, of, nine, short, films,, curated, by, Ruth, Somalo,, that, stepped, out, of, the, corporeal, body, to, explore, experiences, and, memories, that, exist, beyond, the, confines, of, physicality., The, audience, bore, witness, to, a, narrative, that, delved, into, the, world, of, memories, and, dreams, and, tried, to, eke, out, sense, and, order, from, things, distinguished, by, their, formlessness, and, transparency., Invoking, Freud,, the, moderator, Tim, McHenry, (Director, of, Programs, and, Engagement, at, the, Rubin, Museum), noted, that, the, films, dealt, with, the, iceberg, of, the, mind-, trying, to, make, sense, of, only, the, visible, one-seventh,, while, conjecturing, on, the, rest, of, the, unseen, and, unknown., These,, as, filmmaker, Roddy, Bogawa, concluded,, were, all, films, that, were, not, mirrors, but, artefacts, of, a, longer, process, of, negotiation, and, realization., Tim, McHenry,, Ruth, Patir,, Clint, Enns, &, Roddy, Bogawa, With, Peter, Tscherkassky’s, Outer, Space,, we, see, a, woman, physically, moving, into, a, space, marked, by, the, fear, of, a, formless, violence., This, space, punctuated, by, her, frenetic, non-diegetic, screaming, and, running,, evolves, into, a, heterogenous, space, where, fact, and, fiction, cohabit, in, Ruth, Patir’s, Shlomo, X., In, Pathir’s, words,, the, film, creates, fiction, in, order, to, build, a, relationship, between, what, a, believer, believes, to, be, fact,, and, the, fiction, that, the, cynic, has, to, build, in, order, to, trust, the, fact., Through, this, constant, motion, between, two, worlds,, the, film, finally, arrives, at, an, in-between, space, of, constant, flux, wherein, one, arrives, at, a, symphony, amidst, the, cacophony., Dispatch, Continued…, Other, Recent, News, 0March, 1,, 2017,
