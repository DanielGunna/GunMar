Feb, 1,, 2010, Aristotle's, Rhetoric, has, had, an, enormous, influence, on, the, development, of, the, art, of, rhetoric., Not, only, authors, writing, in, the, peripatetic, tradition,, but, also, the, famous, Roman, teachers, of, rhetoric,, such, as, Cicero, and, Quintilian,, frequently, used, elements, stemming, from, the, Aristotelian, doctrine., Nevertheless,, these, authors, were, interested, neither, in, an, authentic, interpretation, of, the, Aristotelian, works, nor, in, the, philosophical, sources, and, backgrounds, of, the, vocabulary, that, Aristotle, had, introduced, to, rhetorical, theory., Thus,, for, two, millennia, the, interpretation, of, Aristotelian, rhetoric, has, become, a, matter, of, the, history, of, rhetoric,, not, of, philosophy., In, the, most, influential, manuscripts, and, editions,, Aristotle's, Rhetoric, was, surrounded, by, rhetorical, works, and, even, written, speeches, of, other, Greek, and, Latin, authors,, and, was, seldom, interpreted, in, the, context, of, the, whole, Corpus, Aristotelicum., It, was, not, until, the, last, few, decades, that, the, philosophically, salient, features, of, the, Aristotelian, rhetoric, were, rediscovered:, in, construing, a, general, theory, of, the, persuasive,, Aristotle, applies, numerous, concepts, and, arguments, that, are, also, treated, in, his, logical,, ethical,, and, psychological, writings., His, theory, of, rhetorical, arguments,, for, example,, is, only, one, further, application, of, his, general, doctrine, of, the, sullogismos,, which, also, forms, the, basis, of, dialectic,, logic,, and, his, theory, of, demonstration., Another, example, is, the, concept, of, emotions:, though, emotions, are, one, of, the, most, important, topics, in, the, Aristotelian, ethics,, he, nowhere, offers, such, an, illuminating, account, of, single, emotions, as, in, the, Rhetoric., Finally,, it, is, the, Rhetoric,, too,, that, informs, us, about, the, cognitive, features, of, language, and, style., 1., Works, on, Rhetoric, 2., The, Agenda, of, the, Rhetoric, 3., Rhetoric, as, a, Counterpart, to, Dialectic, 4., The, Purpose, of, Rhetoric, 4.1, The,

Entries, 1., Works, on, Rhetoric, According, to, ancient, testimonies,, Aristotle, wrote, an, early, dialogue, on, rhetoric, entitled, ‘Grullos’,, in, which, he, put, forward, the, argument, that, rhetoric, cannot, be, an, art, (technê);, and, since, this, is, precisely, the, position, of, Plato's, Gorgias,, the, lost, dialogue, Grullos, has, traditionally, been, regarded, as, a, sign, of, Aristotle's, (alleged), early, Platonism., But, the, evidence, for, the, position, of, this, dialogue, is, too, tenuous, to, support, such, strong, conclusions:, it, also, could, have, been, a, ‘dialectical’, dialogue,, which, listed, the, pros, and, cons, of, the, thesis, that, rhetoric, is, an, art., We, do, not, know, much, more, about, the, so-called, ‘Technê, Sunagogê’,, a, collection, of, previous, theories, of, rhetoric, that, is, also, ascribed, to, Aristotle., Cicero, seems, to, use, this, collection, itself,, or, at, least, a, secondary, source, relying, on, it,, as, his, main, historical, source, when, he, gives, a, short, survey, of, the, history, of, pre-Aristotelian, rhetoric, in, his, Brutus, 46–48., Finally,, Aristotle, once, mentions, a, work, called, ‘Theodecteia’, which, has, also, been, supposed, to, be, Aristotelian;, but, more, probably, he, meant, the, rhetorical, handbook, of, his, follower, Theodectes,, who, was, a, former, pupil, of, Isocrates., What, has, come, down, to, us, are, just, the, three, books, on, rhetoric,, which, we, know, as, The, Rhetoric,, though, the, ancient, catalogue, of, the, Aristotelian, works,, reported, by, Diogenes, Laertius,, mentions, only, two, books, on, rhetoric, (perhaps, our, Rhetoric, I, &, II),, and, two, further, books, on, style, (perhaps, our, Rhetoric, III?)., Whereas, most, modern, authors, agree, that, at, least, the, core, of, Rhet., I, &, II, presents, a, coherent, rhetorical, theory,, the, two, themes, of, Rhet., III, are, not, mentioned, in, the, agenda, of, Rhet., I, &, II., The, conceptual, link, between, Rhet., I, &, II, and, Rhet., III, is, not, given, until, the, very, last, sentence, of, the, second, book., It, is, quite, understandable, that, the, authenticity, of, this, ad, hoc, composition, has, been, questioned:, we, cannot, exclude, the, possibility, that, these, two, parts, of, the, Rhetoric, were, not, put, together, until, the, first, edition, of, Aristotle's, works, completed, by, Andronicus, in, the, first, century., In, the, Poetics, (1456a33), we, find, a, cross-reference, to, a, work, called, ‘Rhetoric’, which, obviously, refers, to, Rhet., I, &, II,, but, excludes, Rhet., III., Regardless, of, such, doubts,, the, systematic, idea, that, links, the, two, heterogeneous, parts, of, the, Rhetoric, does, not, at, all, seem, to, be, unreasonable:, it, is, not, enough, to, have, a, supply, of, things, to, say, (the, so-called, “thought”),, the, theorist, of, rhetoric, must, also, inform, us, about, the, right, way, to, say, those, things, (the, so-called, “style”)., The, chronological, fixing, of, the, Rhetoric, has, turned, out, to, be, a, delicate, matter., At, least, the, core, of, Rhet., I, &, II, seems, to, be, an, early, work,, written, during, Aristotle's, first, stay, in, Athens, (it, is, unclear,, however,, which, chapters, belong, to, that, core;, regularly, mentioned, are, the, chapters, I.4–15, and, II.1–17)., It, is, true, that, the, Rhetoric, refers, to, historical, events, that, fall, in, the, time, of, Aristotle's, exile, and, his, second, stay, in, Athens,, but, most, of, them, can, be, found, in, the, chapters, II.23–24,, and, besides, this,, examples, could, have, been, updated,, which, is, especially, plausible, if, we, assume, that, the, Rhetoric, formed, the, basis, of, a, lecture, held, several, times., Most, striking, are, the, affinities, to, the, (also, early), Topics;, if,, as, it, is, widely, agreed,, the, Topics, represents, a, pre-syllogistic, state, of, Aristotelian, logic,, the, same, is, true, of, the, Rhetoric:, we, actually, find, no, hints, of, syllogistic, inventory, in, it., 2., The, Agenda, of, the, Rhetoric, The, structure, of, Rhet., I, &, II, is, determined, by, two, tripartite, divisions., The, first, division, consists, in, the, distinction, among, the, three, means, of, persuasion:, The, speech, can, produce, persuasion, either, through, the, character, of, the, speaker,, the, emotional, state, of, the, listener,, or, the, argument, (logos), itself, (see, below, §5)., The, second, tripartite, division, concerns, the, three, species, of, public, speech., The, speech, that, takes, place, in, the, assembly, is, defined, as, the, deliberative, species., In, this, rhetorical, species,, the, speaker, either, advises, the, audience, to, do, something, or, warns, against, doing, something., Accordingly,, the, audience, has, to, judge, things, that, are, going, to, happen, in, the, future,, and, they, have, to, decide, whether, these, future, events, are, good, or, bad, for, the, polis,, whether, they, will, cause, advantage, or, harm., The, speech, that, takes, place, before, a, court, is, defined, as, the, judicial, species., The, speaker, either, accuses, somebody, or, defends, herself, or, someone, else., Naturally,, this, kind, of, speech, treats, things, that, happened, in, the, past., The, audience, or, rather, jury, has, to, judge, whether, a, past, event, was, just, or, unjust,, i.e.,, whether, it, was, according, to, the, law, or, contrary, to, the, law., While, the, deliberative, and, judicial, species, have, their, context, in, a, controversial, situation, in, which, the, listener, has, to, decide, in, favor, of, one, of, two, opposing, parties,, the, third, species, does, not, aim, at, such, a, decision:, the, epideictic, speech, praises, or, blames, somebody,, it, tries, to, describe, things, or, deeds, of, the, respective, person, as, honorable, or, shameful., The, first, book, of, the, Rhetoric, treats, the, three, species, in, succession., Rhet., I.4–8, deals, with, the, deliberative,, I.9, with, the, epideictic,, I.10–14, the, judicial, species., These, chapters, are, understood, as, contributing, to, the, argumentative, mode, of, persuasion, or—more, precisely—to, that, part, of, argumentative, persuasion, that, is, specific, to, the, respective, species, of, persuasion., The, second, part, of, the, argumentative, persuasion, that, is, common, to, all, three, species, of, rhetorical, speech, is, treated, in, the, chapters, II.19–26., The, second, means, of, persuasion,, which, works, by, evoking, the, emotions, of, the, audience,, is, described, in, the, chapters, II.2–11., Though, the, following, chapters, II.12–17, treat, different, types, of, character, these, chapters, do, not,, as, is, often, assumed,, develop, the, third, means, of, persuasion,, which, depends, on, the, character, of, the, speaker., The, underlying, theory, of, this, means, of, persuasion, is, elaborated, in, a, few, lines, of, chapter, II.1., The, aforementioned, chapters, II.12–17, give, information, about, different, types, of, character, and, their, disposition, to, emotional, response,, which, can, be, useful, for, those, speakers, who, want, to, arouse, the, emotions, of, the, audience., Why, the, chapters, on, the, argumentative, means, of, persuasion, are, separated, by, the, treatment, of, emotions, and, character, (in, II.2–17), remains, a, riddle,, especially, since, the, chapter, II.18, tries, to, give, a, link, between, the, specific, and, the, common, aspects, of, argumentative, persuasion., Rhetoric, III.1–12, discusses, several, questions, of, style, (see, below, §8.1),, Rhetoric, III.13–19, is, on, the, several, parts, of, a, speech., 3., Rhetoric, as, a, Counterpart, to, Dialectic, Aristotle, stresses, that, rhetoric, is, closely, related, to, dialectic., He, offers, several, formulas, to, describe, this, affinity, between, the, two, disciplines:, first, of, all,, rhetoric, is, said, to, be, a, “counterpart”, (antistrophos), to, dialectic, (Rhet., I.1,, 1354a1);, (ii), it, is, also, called, an, “outgrowth”, (paraphues, ti), of, dialectic, and, the, study, of, character, (Rhet., I.2,, 1356a25f.);, finally,, Aristotle, says, that, rhetoric, is, part, of, dialectic, and, resembles, it, (Rhet., I.2,, 1356a30f.)., In, saying, that, rhetoric, is, a, counterpart, to, dialectic,, Aristotle, obviously, alludes, to, Plato's, Gorgias, (464bff.),, where, rhetoric, is, ironically, defined, as, a, counterpart, to, cookery, in, the, soul., Since,, in, this, passage,, Plato, uses, the, word, ‘antistrophos’, to, designate, an, analogy,, it, is, likely, that, Aristotle, wants, to, express, a, kind, of, analogy, too:, what, dialectic, is, for, the, (private, or, academic), practice, of, attacking, and, maintaining, an, argument,, rhetoric, is, for, the, (public), practice, of, defending, oneself, or, accusing, an, opponent., This, analogy, between, rhetoric, and, dialectic, can, be, substantiated, by, several, common, features, of, both, disciplines:, Rhetoric, and, dialectic, are, concerned, with, things, that, do, not, belong, to, a, definite, genus, or, are, not, the, object, of, a, specific, science., Rhetoric, and, dialectic, rely, on, accepted, sentences, (endoxa)., Rhetoric, and, dialectic, are, not, dependent, on, the, principles, of, specific, sciences., Rhetoric, and, dialectic, are, concerned, with, both, sides, of, an, opposition., Rhetoric, and, dialectic, rely, on, the, same, theory, of, deduction, and, induction., Rhetoric, and, dialectic, similarly, apply, the, so-called, topoi., The, analogy, to, dialectic, has, important, implications, for, the, status, of, rhetoric., Plato, argued, in, his, Gorgias, that, rhetoric, cannot, be, an, art, (technê),, since, it, is, not, related, to, a, definite, subject,, while, real, arts, are, defined, by, their, specific, subjects,, as, e.g., medicine, or, shoemaking, are, defined, by, their, products,, i.e.,, health, and, shoes., However,, though, dialectic, has, no, definite, subject,, it, is, easy, to, see, that, it, nevertheless, rests, on, a, method,, because, dialectic, has, to, grasp, the, reason, why, some, arguments, are, valid, and, others, are, not., Now,, if, rhetoric, is, nothing, but, the, counterpart, to, dialectic, in, the, domain, of, public, speech,, it, must, be, grounded, in, an, investigation, of, what, is, persuasive, and, what, is, not,, and, this,, in, turn,, qualifies, rhetoric, as, an, art., Further,, it, is, central, to, both, disciplines, that, they, deal, with, arguments, from, accepted, premises., Hence, the, rhetorician, who, wants, to, persuade, by, arguments, or, (rhetorical), proofs, can, adapt, most, of, the, dialectical, equipment., Nevertheless,, persuasion, that, takes, place, before, a, public, audience, is, not, only, a, matter, of, arguments, and, proofs,, but, also, of, credibility, and, emotional, attitudes., This, is, why, there, are, also, remarkable, differences, between, the, two, disciplines:, Dialectic, can, be, applied, to, every, object, whatsoever,, rhetoric, is, useful, especially, in, practical, and, public, matters., Dialectic, proceeds, by, questioning, and, answering,, while, rhetoric, for, the, most, part, proceeds, in, continuous, form., Dialectic, is, concerned, with, general, questions,, while, rhetoric, is, concerned, for, the, most, part, with, particular, topics, (i.e.,, things, about, which, we, cannot, gain, real, knowledge)., Certain, uses, of, dialectic, apply, qualified, endoxa,, i.e.,, endoxa, that, are, approved, by, experts,, while, rhetoric, aims, at, endoxa, that, are, popular., Rhetoric, must, take, into, account, that, its, target, group, has, only, restricted, intellectual, resources,, whereas, such, concerns, are, totally, absent, from, dialectic., While, dialectic, tries, to, test, the, consistency, of, a, set, of, sentences,, rhetoric, tries, to, achieve, the, persuasion, of, a, given, audience., Non-argumentative, methods, are, absent, from, dialectic,, while, rhetoric, uses, non-argumentative, means, of, persuasion., 4., The, Purpose, of, Rhetoric, 4.1, The, Definition, of, Rhetoric, Aristotle, defines, the, rhetorician, as, someone, who, is, always, able, to, see, what, is, persuasive, (Topics, VI.12,, 149b25)., Correspondingly,, rhetoric, is, defined, as, the, ability, to, see, what, is, possibly, persuasive, in, every, given, case, (Rhet., I.2,, 1355b26f.)., This, is, not, to, say, that, the, rhetorician, will, be, able, to, convince, under, all, circumstances., Rather, he, is, in, a, situation, similar, to, that, of, the, physician:, the, latter, has, a, complete, grasp, of, his, art, only, if, he, neglects, nothing, that, might, heal, his, patient,, though, he, is, not, able, to, heal, every, patient., Similarly,, the, rhetorician, has, a, complete, grasp, of, his, method,, if, he, discovers, the, available, means, of, persuasion,, though, he, is, not, able, to, convince, everybody., 4.2, The, Neutrality, of, Aristotelian, Rhetoric, Aristotelian, rhetoric, as, such, is, a, neutral, tool, that, can, be, used, by, persons, of, virtuous, or, depraved, character., This, capacity, can, be, used, for, good, or, bad, purposes;, it, can, cause, great, benefits, as, well, as, great, harms., There, is, no, doubt, that, Aristotle, himself, regards, his, system, of, rhetoric, as, something, useful,, but, the, good, purposes, for, which, rhetoric, is, useful, do, not, define, the, rhetorical, capacity, as, such., Thus,, Aristotle, does, not, hesitate, to, concede, on, the, one, hand, that, his, art, of, rhetoric, can, be, misused., But, on, the, other, hand, he, tones, down, the, risk, of, misuse, by, stressing, several, factors:, Generally,, it, is, true, of, all, goods,, except, virtue,, that, they, can, be, misused., Secondly,, using, rhetoric, of, the, Aristotelian, style,, it, is, easier, to, convince, of, the, just, and, good, than, of, their, opposites., Finally,, the, risk, of, misuse, is, compensated, by, the, benefits, that, can, be, accomplished, by, rhetoric, of, the, Aristotelian, style., 4.3, Why, We, Need, Rhetoric, It, could, still, be, objected, that, rhetoric, is, only, useful, for, those, who, want, to, outwit, their, audience, and, conceal, their, real, aims,, since, someone, who, just, wants, to, communicate, the, truth, could, be, straightforward, and, would, not, need, rhetorical, tools., This,, however,, is, not, Aristotle's, point, of, view:, Even, those, who, just, try, to, establish, what, is, just, and, true, need, the, help, of, rhetoric, when, they, are, faced, with, a, public, audience., Aristotle, tells, us, that, it, is, impossible, to, teach, such, an, audience,, even, if, the, speaker, had, the, most, exact, knowledge, of, the, subject., Obviously, he, thinks, that, the, audience, of, a, public, speech, consists, of, ordinary, people, who, are, not, able, to, follow, an, exact, proof, based, on, the, principles, of, a, science., Further,, such, an, audience, can, easily, be, distracted, by, factors, that, do, not, pertain, to, the, subject, at, all;, sometimes, they, are, receptive, to, flattery, or, just, try, to, increase, their, own, advantage., And, this, situation, becomes, even, worse, if, the, constitution,, the, laws,, and, the, rhetorical, habits, in, a, city, are, bad., Finally,, most, of, the, topics, that, are, usually, discussed, in, public, speeches, do, not, allow, of, exact, knowledge,, but, leave, room, for, doubt;, especially, in, such, cases, it, is, important, that, the, speaker, seems, to, be, a, credible, person, and, that, the, audience, is, in, a, sympathetic, mood., For, all, those, reasons,, affecting, the, decisions, of, juries, and, assemblies, is, a, matter, of, persuasiveness,, not, of, knowledge., It, is, true, that, some, people, manage, to, be, persuasive, either, at, random, or, by, habit,, but, it, is, rhetoric, that, gives, us, a, method, to, discover, all, means, of, persuasion, on, any, topic, whatsoever., 4.4, Aristotelian, Rhetoric, as, Proof-Centered, and, Pertinent, Aristotle, joins, Plato, in, criticizing, contemporary, manuals, of, rhetoric., But, how, does, he, manage, to, distinguish, his, own, project, from, the, criticized, manuals?, The, general, idea, seems, to, be, this:, Previous, theorists, of, rhetoric, gave, most, of, their, attention, to, methods, outside, the, subject;, they, taught, how, to, slander,, how, to, arouse, emotions, in, the, audience,, or, how, to, distract, the, attention, of, the, hearers, from, the, subject., This, style, of, rhetoric, promotes, a, situation, in, which, juries, and, assemblies, no, longer, form, rational, judgments, about, the, given, issues,, but, surrender, to, the, litigants., Aristotelian, rhetoric, is, different, in, this, respect:, it, is, centered, on, the, rhetorical, kind, of, proof,, the, enthymeme, (see, below, §6),, which, is, called, the, most, important, means, of, persuasion., Since, people, are, most, strongly, convinced, when, they, suppose, that, something, has, been, proven, (Rhet., I.1,, 1355a5f.),, there, is, no, need, for, the, orator, to, confuse, or, distract, the, audience, by, the, use, of, emotional, appeals,, etc., In, Aristotle's, view, an, orator, will, be, even, more, successful, when, he, just, picks, up, the, convincing, aspects, of, a, given, issue,, thereby, using, commonly-held, opinions, as, premises., Since, people, have, a, natural, disposition, for, the, true, (Rhet., I.1,, 1355a15f.), and, every, man, has, some, contribution, to, make, to, the, truth, (Eudemian, Ethics, I.6,, 1216b31,), there, is, no, unbridgeable, gap, between, the, commonly-held, opinions, and, what, is, true., This, alleged, affinity, between, the, true, and, the, persuasive, justifies, Aristotle's, project, of, a, rhetoric, that, essentially, relies, on, the, persuasiveness, of, pertinent, argumentation;, and, it, is, just, this, argumentative, character, of, Aristotelian, rhetoric, that, explains, the, close, affinity, between, rhetoric, and, dialectic, (see, above, §3)., 4.5, Is, There, an, Inconsistency, in, Aristotle's, Rhetorical, Theory?, Of, course,, Aristotle's, rhetoric, covers, non-argumentative, tools, of, persuasion, as, well., He, tells, the, orator, how, to, stimulate, emotions, and, how, to, make, himself, credible, (see, below, §5);, his, art, of, rhetoric, includes, considerations, about, delivery, and, style, (see, below, §8.1), and, the, parts, of, a, speech., It, is, understandable, that, several, interpreters, found, an, insoluble, tension, between, the, argumentative, means, of, pertinent, rhetoric, and, non-argumentative, tools, that, aim, at, what, is, outside, the, subject., It, does, not, seem,, however,, that, Aristotle, himself, saw, a, major, conflict, between, these, diverse, tools, of, persuasion—presumably, for, the, following, reasons:, (i), He, leaves, no, doubt, that, the, subject, that, is, treated, in, a, speech, has, the, highest, priority, (e.g., Rhet., III.1,, 1403b18–27)., Thus,, it, is, not, surprising, that, there, are, even, passages, that, regard, the, non-argumentative, tools, as, a, sort, of, accidental, contribution, to, the, process, of, persuasion,, which, essentially, proceeds, in, the, manner, of, dialectic, (cp., Rhet., I.1,, 1354a15)., (ii), There, are,, he, says, (III.1,, 1404a2f.),, methods, that, are, not, right,, but, necessary, because, of, certain, deficiencies, of, the, audience., His, point, seems, to, be, that, the, argumentative, method, becomes, less, effective,, the, worse, the, condition, of, the, audience, is., This, again, is, to, say, that, it, is, due, to, the, badness, of, the, audience, when, his, rhetoric, includes, aspects, that, are, not, in, line, with, the, idea, of, argumentative, and, pertinent, rhetoric., (iii), In, dealing, with, methods, of, traditional, rhetoric,, Aristotle, obviously, assumes, that, even, methods, that, have, traditionally, been, used, instead, of, argumentation, can, be, refined, so, that, they, support, the, aim, of, an, argumentative, style, of, rhetoric., The, prologue, of, a, speech,, for, example,, was, traditionally, used, for, appeals, to, the, listener,, but, it, can, also, be, used, to, set, out, the, issue, of, the, speech,, thus, contributing, to, its, clearness., Similarly,, the, epilogue, has, traditionally, been, used, to, arouse, emotions, like, pity, or, anger;, but, as, soon, as, the, epilogue, recalls, the, conclusions, reached,, it, will, make, the, speech, more, understandable., 5., The, Three, Means, of, Persuasion, The, systematical, core, of, Aristotle's, Rhetoric, is, the, doctrine, that, there, are, three, technical, means, of, persuasion., The, attribute, ‘technical’, implies, two, characteristics:, (i), Technical, persuasion, must, rest, on, a, method,, and, this,, in, turn,, is, to, say, that, we, must, know, the, reason, why, some, things, are, persuasive, and, some, are, not., Further,, methodical, persuasion, must, rest, on, a, complete, analysis, of, what, it, means, to, be, persuasive., (ii), Technical, means, of, persuasion, must, be, provided, by, the, speaker, himself,, whereas, preexisting, facts,, such, as, oaths,, witnesses,, testimonies,, etc., are, non-technical,, since, they, cannot, be, prepared, by, the, speaker., A, speech, consists, of, three, things:, the, speaker,, the, subject, that, is, treated, in, the, speech,, and, the, listener, to, whom, the, speech, is, addressed, (Rhet., I.3,, 1358a37ff.)., It, seems, that, this, is, why, only, three, technical, means, of, persuasion, are, possible:, Technical, means, of, persuasion, are, either, (a), in, the, character, of, the, speaker,, or, (b), in, the, emotional, state, of, the, hearer,, or, (c), in, the, argument, (logos), itself., (a), The, persuasion, is, accomplished, by, character, whenever, the, speech, is, held, in, such, a, way, as, to, render, the, speaker, worthy, of, credence., If, the, speaker, appears, to, be, credible,, the, audience, will, form, the, second-order, judgment, that, propositions, put, forward, by, the, credible, speaker, are, true, or, acceptable., This, is, especially, important, in, cases, where, there, is, no, exact, knowledge, but, room, for, doubt., But, how, does, the, speaker, manage, to, appear, a, credible, person?, He, must, display, (i), practical, intelligence, (phronêsis),, (ii), a, virtuous, character,, and, (iii), good, will, (Rhet., II.1,, 1378a6ff.);, for,, if, he, displayed, none, of, them,, the, audience, would, doubt, that, he, is, able, to, give, good, advice, at, all., Again,, if, he, displayed, (i), without, (ii), and, (iii),, the, audience, could, doubt, whether, the, aims, of, the, speaker, are, good., Finally,, if, he, displayed, (i), and, (ii), without, (iii),, the, audience, could, still, doubt, whether, the, speaker, gives, the, best, suggestion,, though, he, knows, what, it, is., But, if, he, displays, all, of, them,, Aristotle, concludes,, it, cannot, rationally, be, doubted, that, his, suggestions, are, credible., It, must, be, stressed, that, the, speaker, must, accomplish, these, effects, by, what, he, says;, it, is, not, necessary, that, he, is, actually, virtuous:, on, the, contrary,, a, preexisting, good, character, cannot, be, part, of, the, technical, means, of, persuasion., (b), The, success, of, the, persuasive, efforts, depends, on, the, emotional, dispositions, of, the, audience;, for, we, do, not, judge, in, the, same, way, when, we, grieve, and, rejoice, or, when, we, are, friendly, and, hostile., Thus,, the, orator, has, to, arouse, emotions, exactly, because, emotions, have, the, power, to, modify, our, judgments:, to, a, judge, who, is, in, a, friendly, mood,, the, person, about, whom, he, is, going, to, judge, seems, not, to, do, wrong, or, only, in, a, small, way;, but, to, the, judge, who, is, in, an, angry, mood,, the, same, person, will, seem, to, do, the, opposite, (cp., Rhet., II.1,, 1378a1ff.)., Many, interpreters, writing, on, the, rhetorical, emotions, were, misled, by, the, role, of, the, emotions, in, Aristotle's, ethics:, they, suggested, that, the, orator, has, to, arouse, the, emotions, in, order, (i), to, motivate, the, audience, or, (ii), to, make, them, better, persons, (since, Aristotle, requires, that, virtuous, persons, do, the, right, things, together, with, the, right, emotions)., Thesis, (i), is, false, for, the, simple, reason, that, the, aim, of, rhetorical, persuasion, is, a, certain, judgment, (krisis),, not, an, action, or, practical, decision, (prohairesis)., Thesis, (ii), is, false,, because, moral, education, is, not, the, purpose, of, rhetoric, (see, above, §4),, nor, could, it, be, effected, by, a, public, speech:, “Now, if, speeches, were, in, themselves, enough, to, make, men, good,, they, would, justly,, as, Theognis, says,, have, won, very, great, rewards,, and, such, rewards, should, have, been, provided;, but, as, things, are, …, they, are, not, able, to, encourage, the, many, to, nobility, and, goodness.”, (EN, X.9., 1179b4–10), How, is, it, possible, for, the, orator, to, bring, the, audience, to, a, certain, emotion?, Aristotle's, technique, essentially, rests, on, the, knowledge, of, the, definition, of, every, significant, emotion., Let,, for, example,, anger, be, defined, as, “desire,, accompanied, with, pain,, for, conspicuous, revenge, for, a, conspicuous, slight, that, was, directed, against, oneself, or, those, near, to, one,, when, such, a, slight, is, undeserved.”, (Rhet., II.2, 1378a31–33)., According, to, such, a, definition,, someone, who, believes, that, he, has, suffered, a, slight, from, a, person, who, is, not, entitled, to, do, so,, etc.,, will, become, angry., If, we, take, such, a, definition, for, granted,, it, is, possible, to, deduce, circumstances, in, which, a, person, will, most, probably, be, angry;, for, example,, we, can, deduce, (i), in, what, state, of, mind, people, are, angry, and, (ii), against, whom, they, are, angry, and, (iii), for, what, sorts, of, reason., Aristotle, deduces, these, three, factors, for, several, emotions, in, the, chapters, II.2–11., With, this, equipment,, the, orator, will, be, able,, for, example,, to, highlight, such, characteristics, of, a, case, as, are, likely, to, provoke, anger, in, the, audience., In, comparison, with, the, tricks, of, former, rhetoricians,, this, method, of, arousing, emotions, has, a, striking, advantage:, The, orator, who, wants, to, arouse, emotions, must, not, even, speak, outside, the, subject;, it, is, sufficient, to, detect, aspects, of, a, given, subject, that, are, causally, connected, with, the, intended, emotion., (c), We, persuade, by, the, argument, itself, when, we, demonstrate, or, seem, to, demonstrate, that, something, is, the, case., For, Aristotle,, there, are, two, species, of, arguments:, inductions, and, deductions, (Posterior, Analytics, I.1,, 71a5ff.)., Induction, (epagôgê), is, defined, as, the, proceeding, from, particulars, up, to, a, universal, (Topics, I.12,, 105a13ff.)., A, deduction, (sullogismos), is, an, argument, in, which,, certain, things, having, been, supposed,, something, different, from, the, suppositions, results, of, necessity, through, them, (Topics, I.1,, 100a25ff.), or, because, of, their, being, true, (Prior, Analytics, I.2,, 24b18–20)., The, inductive, argument, in, rhetoric, is, the, example, (paradeigma);, unlike, other, inductive, arguments,, it, does, not, proceed, from, many, particular, cases, to, one, universal, case,, but, from, one, particular, to, a, similar, particular, if, both, particulars, fall, under, the, same, genus, (Rhet., I.2,, 1357b25ff.)., The, deductive, argument, in, rhetoric, is, the, enthymeme, (see, below, §6):, but, when,, certain, things, being, the, case,, something, different, results, beside, them, because, of, their, being, true,, either, universally, or, for, the, most, part,, it, is, called, deduction, here, (in, dialectic), and, enthymeme, there, (in, rhetoric)., It, is, remarkable, that, Aristotle, uses, the, qualification, “either, universally, or, for, the, most, part”:, obviously,, he, wants, to, say, that, in, some, cases, the, conclusion, follows, universally,, i.e.,, by, necessity,, while, in, other, cases, it, follows, only, for, the, most, part., At, first, glance,, this, seems, to, be, inconsistent,, since, a, non-necessary, inference, is, no, longer, a, deduction., However,, it, has, been, disputed, whether, in, arguments, from, probable, premises, the, formula, “for, the, most, part”, qualifies, the, inference, itself, (“If, for, the, most, part, such, and, such, is, the, case, it, follows, for, the, most, part, that, something, different, is, the, case”),, or, only, the, conclusion, (“If, for, the, most, part, such, and, such, is, the, case, it, follows, by, necessity, that, for, the, most, part, something, different, is, the, case”)., If, the, former, interpretation, is, true,, then, Aristotle, concedes, in, the, very, definition, of, the, enthymeme, that, some, enthymemes, are, not, deductive., But, if, the, latter, interpretation, (which, has, a, parallel, in, An., post., 87b23–25), is, correct,, an, enthymeme, whose, premises, and, conclusion, are, for, the, most, part, true, would, still, be, a, valid, deduction., 6., The, Enthymeme, 6.1, The, Concept, of, Enthymeme, For, Aristotle,, an, enthymeme, is, what, has, the, function, of, a, proof, or, demonstration, in, the, domain, of, public, speech,, since, a, demonstration, is, a, kind, of, sullogismos, and, the, enthymeme, is, said, to, be, a, sullogismos, too., The, word, ‘enthymeme’, (from, ‘enthumeisthai—to, consider’), had, already, been, coined, by, Aristotle's, predecessors, and, originally, designated, clever, sayings,, bon, mots,, and, short, arguments, involving, a, paradox, or, contradiction., The, concepts, ‘proof’, (apodeixis), and, ‘sullogismos’, play, a, crucial, role, in, Aristotle's, logical-dialectical, theory., In, applying, them, to, a, term, of, conventional, rhetoric,, Aristotle, appeals, to, a, well-known, rhetorical, technique,, but,, at, the, same, time,, restricts, and, codifies, the, original, meaning, of, ‘enthymeme’:, properly, understood,, what, people, call, ‘enthymeme’, should, have, the, form, of, a, sullogismos,, i.e.,, a, deductive, argument., 6.2, Formal, Requirements, In, general,, Aristotle, regards, deductive, arguments, as, a, set, of, sentences, in, which, some, sentences, are, premises, and, one, is, the, conclusion,, and, the, inference, from, the, premises, to, the, conclusion, is, guaranteed, by, the, premises, alone., Since, enthymemes, in, the, proper, sense, are, expected, to, be, deductive, arguments,, the, minimal, requirement, for, the, formulation, of, enthymemes, is, that, they, have, to, display, the, premise-conclusion, structure, of, deductive, arguments., This, is, why, enthymemes, have, to, include, a, statement, as, well, as, a, kind, of, reason, for, the, given, statement., Typically, this, reason, is, given, in, a, conditional, ‘if’-clause, or, a, causal, ‘since’-, or, ‘for’-clause., Examples, of, the, former,, conditional, type, are:, “If, not, even, the, gods, know, everything,, human, beings, can, hardly, do, so.”, “If, the, war, is, the, cause, of, present, evils,, things, should, be, set, right, by, making, peace.”, Examples, of, the, latter,, causal, type, are:, “One, should, not, be, educated,, for, one, ought, not, be, envied, (and, educated, people, are, usually, envied).”, “She, has, given, birth,, for, she, has, milk.”, Aristotle, stresses, that, the, sentence, “There, is, no, man, among, us, who, is, free”, taken, for, itself, is, a, maxim,, but, becomes, an, enthymeme, as, soon, as, it, is, used, together, with, a, reason, such, as, “for, all, are, slaves, of, money, or, of, chance, (and, no, slave, of, money, or, chance, is, free).”, Sometimes, the, required, reason, may, even, be, implicit,, as, e.g., in, the, sentence, “As, a, mortal,, do, not, cherish, immortal, anger”, the, reason, why, one, should, not, cherish, mortal, anger, is, implicitly, given, in, the, phrase, “immortal,”, which, alludes, to, the, rule, that, is, not, appropriate, for, mortal, beings, to, have, such, an, attitude., 6.3, Enthymemes, as, Dialectical, Arguments, Aristotle, calls, the, enthymeme, the, “body, of, persuasion”,, implying, that, everything, else, is, only, an, addition, or, accident, to, the, core, of, the, persuasive, process., The, reason, why, the, enthymeme,, as, the, rhetorical, kind, of, proof, or, demonstration,, should, be, regarded, as, central, to, the, rhetorical, process, of, persuasion, is, that, we, are, most, easily, persuaded, when, we, think, that, something, has, been, demonstrated., Hence,, the, basic, idea, of, a, rhetorical, demonstration, seems, to, be, this:, In, order, to, make, a, target, group, believe, that, q,, the, orator, must, first, select, a, sentence, p, or, some, sentences, p1, …, pn, that, are, already, accepted, by, the, target, group;, secondly, he, has, to, show, that, q, can, be, derived, from, p, or, p1, …, pn,, using, p, or, p1, …, pn, as, premises., Given, that, the, target, persons, form, their, beliefs, in, accordance, with, rational, standards,, they, will, accept, q, as, soon, as, they, understand, that, q, can, be, demonstrated, on, the, basis, of, their, own, opinions., Consequently,, the, construction, of, enthymemes, is, primarily, a, matter, of, deducing, from, accepted, opinions, (endoxa)., Of, course,, it, is, also, possible, to, use, premises, that, are, not, commonly, accepted, by, themselves,, but, can, be, derived, from, commonly, accepted, opinions;, other, premises, are, only, accepted, since, the, speaker, is, held, to, be, credible;, still, other, enthymemes, are, built, from, signs:, see, §6.5., That, a, deduction, is, made, from, accepted, opinions—as, opposed, to, deductions, from, first, and, true, sentences, or, principles—is, the, defining, feature, of, dialectical, argumentation, in, the, Aristotelian, sense., Thus,, the, formulation, of, enthymemes, is, a, matter, of, dialectic,, and, the, dialectician, has, the, competence, that, is, needed, for, the, construction, of, enthymemes., If, enthymemes, are, a, subclass, of, dialectical, arguments,, then, it, is, natural, to, expect, a, specific, difference, by, which, one, can, tell, enthymemes, apart, from, all, other, kinds, of, dialectical, arguments, (traditionally,, commentators, regarded, logical, incompleteness, as, such, a, difference;, for, some, objections, against, the, traditional, view,, see, §6.4)., Nevertheless,, this, expectation, is, somehow, misled:, The, enthymeme, is, different, from, other, kinds, of, dialectical, arguments,, insofar, as, it, is, used, in, the, rhetorical, context, of, public, speech, (and, rhetorical, arguments, are, called, ‘enthymemes’);, thus,, no, further, formal, or, qualitative, differences, are, needed., However,, in, the, rhetorical, context, there, are, two, factors, that, the, dialectician, has, to, keep, in, mind, if, she, wants, to, become, a, rhetorician, too,, and, if, the, dialectical, argument, is, to, become, a, successful, enthymeme., First,, the, typical, subjects, of, public, speech, do, not—as, the, subject, of, dialectic, and, theoretical, philosophy—belong, to, the, things, that, are, necessarily, the, case,, but, are, among, those, things, that, are, the, goal, of, practical, deliberation, and, can, also, be, otherwise., Second,, as, opposed, to, well-trained, dialecticians, the, audience, of, public, speech, is, characterized, by, an, intellectual, insufficiency;, above, all,, the, members, of, a, jury, or, assembly, are, not, accustomed, to, following, a, longer, chain, of, inferences., Therefore, enthymemes, must, not, be, as, precise, as, a, scientific, demonstration, and, should, be, shorter, than, ordinary, dialectical, arguments., This,, however,, is, not, to, say, that, the, enthymeme, is, defined, by, incompleteness, and, brevity., Rather,, it, is, a, sign, of, a, well-executed, enthymeme, that, the, content, and, the, number, of, its, premises, are, adjusted, to, the, intellectual, capacities, of, the, public, audience;, but, even, an, enthymeme, that, failed, to, incorporate, these, qualities, would, still, be, enthymeme., 6.4, The, Brevity, of, the, Enthymeme, In, a, well, known, passage, (Rhet., I.2,, 1357a7–18;, similar:, Rhet., II.22,, 1395b24–26),, Aristotle, says, that, the, enthymeme, often, has, few, or, even, fewer, premises, than, some, other, deductions,, (sullogismoi)., Since, most, interpreters, refer, the, word, ‘sullogismos’, to, the, syllogistic, theory, (see, the, entry, on, Aristotle's, logic),, according, to, which, a, proper, deduction, has, exactly, two, premises,, those, lines, have, led, to, the, widespread, understanding, that, Aristotle, defines, the, enthymeme, as, a, sullogismos, in, which, one, of, two, premises, has, been, suppressed,, i.e.,, as, an, abbreviated,, incomplete, syllogism., But, certainly, the, mentioned, passages, do, not, attempt, to, give, a, definition, of, the, enthymeme,, nor, does, the, word, ‘sullogismos’, necessarily, refer, to, deductions, with, exactly, two, premises., Properly, understood,, both, passages, are, about, the, selection, of, appropriate, premises,, not, about, logical, incompleteness., The, remark, that, enthymemes, often, have, few, or, less, premises, concludes, the, discussion, of, two, possible, mistakes, the, orator, could, make, (Rhet., I.2,, 1357a7–10):, One, can, draw, conclusions, from, things, that, have, previously, been, deduced, or, from, things, that, have, not, been, deduced, yet., The, latter, method, is, unpersuasive,, for, the, premises, are, not, accepted,, nor, have, they, been, introduced., The, former, method, is, problematic,, too:, if, the, orator, has, to, introduce, the, needed, premises, by, another, deduction,, and, the, premises, of, this, pre-deduction, too,, etc.,, one, will, end, up, with, a, long, chain, of, deductions., Arguments, with, several, deductive, steps, are, common, in, dialectical, practice,, but, one, cannot, expect, the, audience, of, a, public, speech, to, follow, such, long, arguments., This, is, why, Aristotle, says, that, the, enthymeme, is, and, should, be, from, fewer, premises., Supplement, on, The, Brevity, of, the, Enthymeme, 6.5, Different, Types, of, Enthymemes, Just, as, there, is, a, difference, between, real, and, apparent, or, fallacious, deductions, in, dialectic,, we, have, to, distinguish, between, real, and, apparent, or, fallacious, enthymemes, in, rhetoric., The, topoi, for, real, enthymemes, are, given, in, chapter, II.23,, for, fallacious, enthymemes, in, chapter, II.24., The, fallacious, enthymeme, pretends, to, include, a, valid, deduction,, while, it, actually, rests, on, a, fallacious, inference., Further,, Aristotle, distinguishes, between, enthymemes, taken, from, probable, (eikos), premises, and, enthymemes, taken, from, signs, (sêmeia)., (Rhet., I.2,, 1357a32–33)., In, a, different, context,, he, says, that, enthymemes, are, based, on, probabilities,, examples,, tekmêria, (i.e.,, proofs,, evidences),, and, signs, (Rhet., II.25,, 1402b12–14)., Since, the, so-called, tekmêria, are, a, subclass, of, signs, and, the, examples, are, used, to, establish, general, premises,, this, is, only, an, extension, of, the, former, classification., (Note, that, neither, classification, interferes, with, the, idea, that, premises, have, to, be, accepted, opinions:, with, respect, to, the, signs,, the, audience, must, believe, that, they, exist, and, accept, that, they, indicate, the, existence, of, something, else,, and, with, respect, to, the, probabilities,, people, must, accept, that, something, is, likely, to, happen.), However,, it, is, not, clear, whether, this, is, meant, to, be, an, exhaustive, typology., That, most, of, the, rhetorical, arguments, are, taken, from, probable, premises, (“For, the, most, part, it, is, true, that, …”, “It, is, likely, that, …”), is, due, to, the, typical, subjects, of, public, speech,, which, are, rarely, necessary., When, using, a, sign-argument, or, sign-enthymeme, we, do, not, try, to, explain, a, given, fact;, we, just, indicate, that, something, exists, or, is, the, case:, “…, anything, such, that, when, it, is, another, thing, is,, or, when, it, has, come, into, being,, the, other, has, come, into, being, before, or, after,, is, a, sign, of, the, other's, being, or, having, come, into, being.”, (Prior, Analytics, II.27,, 70a7ff.)., But, there, are, several, types, of, sign-arguments, too;, Aristotle, offers, the, following, examples:,  , Rhetoric, I.2, Prior, Analytics, II.27, (i), Wise, men, are, just,, since, Socrates, is, just., Wise, men, are, good,, since, Pittacus, is, good., (ii), He, is, ill,, since, he, has, fever./, She, has, given, birth,, since, she, has, milk., This, woman, has, a, child,, since, she, has, milk., (iii), This, man, has, fever,, since, he, breathes, rapidly., She, is, pregnant,, since, she, is, pale., Sign-arguments, of, type, (i), and, (iii), can, always, be, refuted,, even, if, the, premises, are, true;, that, is, to, say, that, they, do, not, include, a, valid, deduction, (sullogismos);, Aristotle, calls, them, asullogistos, (non-deductive)., Sign-arguments, of, type, (ii), can, never, be, refuted, if, the, premise, is, true,, since,, for, example,, it, is, not, possible, that, someone, has, fever, without, being, ill,, or, that, someone, has, milk, without, having, given, birth,, etc., This, latter, type, of, sign-enthymemes, is, necessary, and, is, also, called, tekmêrion, (proof,, evidence)., Now,, if, some, sign-enthymemes, are, valid, deductions, and, some, are, not,, it, is, tempting, to, ask, whether, Aristotle, regarded, the, non-necessary, sign-enthymemes, as, apparent, or, fallacious, arguments., However,, there, seems, to, be, a, more, attractive, reading:, We, accept, a, fallacious, argument, only, if, we, are, deceived, about, its, logical, form., But, we, could, regard,, for, example,, the, inference, “She, is, pregnant,, since, she, is, pale”, as, a, good, and, informative, argument,, even, if, we, know, that, it, does, not, include, a, logically, necessary, inference., So, it, seems, as, if, Aristotle, didn't, regard, all, non-necessary, sign-arguments, as, fallacious, or, deceptive;, but, even, if, this, is, true,, it, is, difficult, for, Aristotle, to, determine, the, sense, in, which, non-necessary, sign-enthymemes, are, valid, arguments,, since, he, is, bound, to, the, alternative, of, deduction, and, induction,, and, neither, class, seems, appropriate, for, non-necessary, sign-arguments., 7., The, Topoi, Generally, speaking,, an, Aristotelian, topos, (‘place’,, ‘location’), is, an, argumentative, scheme, that, enables, a, dialectician, or, rhetorician, to, construe, an, argument, for, a, given, conclusion., The, use, of, so-called, topoi, or, ‘loci, communes’, can, be, traced, back, to, early, rhetoricians, such, as, Protagoras,, Gorgias, (cp., Cicero,, Brutus,, 46–48), and, Isocrates., But, while, in, earlier, rhetoric, a, topos, was, understood, as, a, complete, pattern, or, formula, that, can, be, mentioned, at, a, certain, stage, of, the, speech, to, produce, a, certain, effect,, most, of, the, Aristotelian, topoi, are, general, instructions, saying, that, a, conclusion, of, a, certain, form, can, be, derived, from, premises, of, a, certain, form;, and, because, of, this, ‘formal’, or, ‘semi-formal’, character, of, Aristotelian, topoi,, one, topos, can, be, used, to, construe, several, different, arguments., Aristotle's, book, Topics, lists, some, hundred, topoi, for, the, construction, of, dialectical, arguments., These, lists, of, topoi, form, the, core, of, the, method, by, which, the, dialectician, should, be, able, to, formulate, deductions, on, any, problem, that, could, be, proposed., Most, of, the, instructions, that, the, Rhetoric, gives, for, the, composition, of, enthymemes, are, also, organized, as, lists, of, topoi;, especially, the, first, book, of, the, Rhetoric, essentially, consists, of, topoi, concerning, the, subjects, of, the, three, species, of, public, speech., 7.1, The, Definition, of, ‘Topos’, It, is, striking, that, the, work, that, is, almost, exclusively, dedicated, to, the, collection, of, topoi,, the, book, Topics,, does, not, even, make, an, attempt, to, define, the, concept, of, topos., At, any, rate, the, Rhetoric, gives, a, sort, of, defining, characterization:, “I, call, the, same, thing, element, and, topos;, for, an, element, or, a, topos, is, a, heading, under, which, many, enthymemes, fall.”, (Rhet., 1403a18–19), By, ‘element’, Aristotle, does, not, mean, a, proper, part, of, the, enthymeme,, but, a, general, form, under, which, many, concrete, enthymemes, of, the, same, type, can, be, subsumed., According, to, this, definition,, the, topos, is, a, general, argumentative, form, or, pattern,, and, the, concrete, arguments, are, instantiations, of, the, general, topos., That, the, topos, is, a, general, instruction, from, which, several, arguments, can, be, derived,, is, crucial, for, Aristotle's, understanding, of, an, artful, method, of, argumentation;, for, a, teacher, of, rhetoric, who, makes, his, pupils, learn, ready, samples, of, arguments, would, not, impart, the, art, itself, to, them,, but, only, the, products, of, this, art,, just, as, if, someone, pretending, to, teach, the, art, of, shoe-making, only, gave, samples, of, already, made, shoes, to, his, pupils, (see, Sophistical, Refutations, 183b36ff.)., 7.2, The, Word, ‘Topos’, and, the, Technique, of, Places, The, word, ‘topos’, (place,, location), most, probably, is, derived, from, an, ancient, method, of, memorizing, a, great, number, of, items, on, a, list, by, associating, them, with, successive, places,, say, the, houses, along, a, street,, one, is, acquainted, with., By, recalling, the, houses, along, the, street, we, can, also, remember, the, associated, items., Full, descriptions, of, this, technique, can, be, found, in, Cicero,, De, Oratore, II, 86–88,, 351–360,, Auctor, ad, Herennium, III, 16–24,, 29–40, and, in, Quintilian,, Institutio, XI, 2,, 11–33)., In, Topics, 163b28–32,, Aristotle, seems, to, allude, to, this, technique:, “For, just, as, in, the, art, of, remembering,, the, mere, mention, of, the, places, instantly, makes, us, recall, the, things,, so, these, will, make, us, more, apt, at, deductions, through, looking, to, these, defined, premises, in, order, of, enumeration.”, Aristotle, also, alludes, to, this, technique, in, On, the, soul, 427b18–20,, On, Memory, 452a12–16,, and, On, Dreams, 458b20–22., But, though, the, name, ‘topos’, may, be, derived, from, this, mnemotechnical, context,, Aristotle's, use, of, topoi, does, not, rely, on, the, technique, of, places., At, least, within, the, system, of, the, book, Topics,, every, given, problem, must, be, analyzed, in, terms, of, some, formal, criteria:, Does, the, predicate, of, the, sentence, in, question, ascribe, a, genus, or, a, definition, or, peculiar, or, accidental, properties, to, the, subject?, Does, the, sentence, express, a, sort, of, opposition,, either, contradiction, or, contrariety,, etc.?, Does, the, sentence, express, that, something, is, more, or, less, the, case?, Does, it, maintain, identity, or, diversity?, Are, the, words, used, linguistically, derived, from, words, that, are, part, of, an, accepted, premise?, Depending, on, such, formal, criteria, of, the, analyzed, sentence, one, has, to, refer, to, a, fitting, topos., For, this, reason,, the, succession, of, topoi, in, the, book, Topics, is, organized, in, accordance, with, their, salient, formal, criteria;, and, this,, again,, makes, a, further, mnemotechnique, superfluous., More, or, less, the, same, is, true, of, the, Rhetoric—except, that, most, of, its, topoi, are, structured, by, material, and, not, by, formal, criteria,, as, we, shall, see, in, section, 7.4., Besides, all, this,, there, is, at, least, one, passage, in, which, the, use, of, the, word, ‘topos’, can, be, explained, without, referring, to, the, previously, mentioned, mnemotechnique:, In, Topics, VIII.1,, 155b4–5, Aristotle, says:, “we, must, find, the, location, (topos), from, which, to, attack”,, where, the, word, ‘topos’, is, obviously, used, to, mean, a, starting, point, for, attacking, the, theses, of, the, opponents., 7.3, The, Elements, of, a, Topos, A, typical, Aristotelian, topos, runs, as, follows:, “Again,, if, the, accident, of, a, thing, has, a, contrary,, see, whether, it, belongs, to, the, subject, to, which, the, accident, in, question, has, been, declared, to, belong:, for, if, the, latter, belongs,, the, former, could, not, belong;, for, it, is, impossible, that, contrary, predicates, should, belong, at, the, same, time, to, the, same, thing.”, (Topics, 113a20–24)., Like, most, topoi,, it, includes, (i), a, sort, of, general, instruction, (“see,, whether, …”);, further, it, mentions, (ii), an, argumentative, scheme—in, the, given, example,, the, scheme, ‘if, the, accidental, predicate, p, belongs, to, the, subject, s,, then, the, opposed, P*, cannot, belong, to, s, too’., Finally,, the, topos, refers, to, (iii), a, general, rule, or, principle, (“for, it, is, impossible,, …”), which, justifies, the, given, scheme., Other, topoi, often, include, the, discussion, of, (iv), examples;, still, other, topoi, suggest, (v), how, to, apply, the, given, schemes.—Though, these, are, elements, that, regularly, occur, in, Aristotelian, topoi,, there, is, nothing, like, a, standard, form, with, which, all, topoi, comply., Often, Aristotle, is, very, brief, and, leaves, it, to, the, reader, to, add, the, missing, elements., 7.4, The, Function, of, a, Topos, In, a, nutshell,, the, function, of, a, topos, can, be, explained, as, follows., First, of, all,, one, has, to, select, an, apt, topos, for, a, given, conclusion., The, conclusion, is, either, a, thesis, of, our, opponent, that, we, want, to, refute,, or, our, own, assertion, we, want, to, establish, or, defend., Accordingly,, there, are, two, uses, of, topoi:, they, can, either, prove, or, disprove, a, given, sentence;, some, can, be, used, for, both, purposes,, others, for, only, one, of, them., Most, topoi, are, selected, by, certain, formal, features, of, the, given, conclusion;, if,, for, example,, the, conclusion, maintains, a, definition,, we, have, to, select, our, topos, from, a, list, of, topoi, pertaining, to, definitions,, etc., When, it, comes, to, the, so-called, ‘material’, topoi, of, the, Rhetoric,, the, appropriate, topos, must, be, selected, not, by, formal, criteria,, but, in, accordance, with, the, content, of, the, conclusion—whether,, for, example,, something, is, said, to, be, useful, or, honorable, or, just,, etc., Once, we, have, selected, a, topos, that, is, appropriate, for, a, given, conclusion,, the, topos, can, be, used, to, construe, a, premise, from, which, the, given, conclusion, can, be, derived., If, for, example, the, argumentative, scheme, is, ‘If, a, predicate, is, generally, true, of, a, genus,, then, the, predicate, is, also, true, of, any, species, of, that, genus’,, we, can, derive, the, conclusion, ‘the, capacity, of, nutrition, belongs, to, plants’, using, the, premise, ‘the, capacity, of, nutrition, belongs, to, all, living, things’,, since, ‘living, thing’, is, the, genus, of, the, species, ‘plants’., If, the, construed, premise, is, accepted,, either, by, the, opponent, in, a, dialectical, debate, or, by, the, audience, in, public, speech,, we, can, draw, the, intended, conclusion., It, has, been, disputed, whether, the, topos, (or,, more, precisely,, the, ‘if, …,, then, …’, scheme, that, is, included, in, a, topos), that, we, use, to, construe, an, argument, must, itself, be, regarded, as, a, further, premise, of, the, argument., It, could, be, either,, as, some, say,, the, premise, of, a, propositional, scheme, such, as, the, modus, ponens,, or,, as, others, assume,, as, the, conditional, premise, of, a, hypothetical, syllogism., Aristotle, himself, does, not, favor, one, of, these, interpretations, explicitly., But, even, if, he, regarded, the, topoi, as, additional, premises, in, a, dialectical, or, rhetorical, argument,, it, is, beyond, any, doubt, that, he, did, not, use, them, as, premises, that, must, be, explicitly, mentioned, or, even, approved, by, the, opponent, or, audience., Supplement, on, the, Topoi, of, the, Rhetoric, 8., Style:, How, to, Say, Things, with, Words, Rhet., III.1–12, introduces, the, topic, of, lexis,, usually, translated, as, ‘style’., This, topic, was, not, announced, until, the, final, passage, of, Rhet., II,, so, that, most, scholars, have, come, to, think, of, this, section, as, a, more, or, less, self-contained, treatise., The, insertion, of, this, treatise, into, the, Rhetoric, is, motivated, by, the, claim, that,, while, Rhet., I, &, II, dealt, with, thought, (dianoia),, i.e.,, about, what, the, orator, should, say,, it, remains, to, inquire, into, the, various, ways, of, saying, or, formulating, one, and, the, same, thing., In, the, course, of, Rhet., III.1–12, it, turns, out, that, Aristotle, tackles, this, task, by, using, some, quite, heterogeneous, approaches., After, an, initial, exploration, of, the, field, of, delivery, and, style, (III.1), Aristotle, tries, to, determine, what, good, prose, style, consists, in;, for, this, purpose, he, has, to, go, into, the, differentiation, and, the, selection, of, various, kinds, of, nouns,, one, of, which, is, defined, as, metaphor, (III.2)., The, following, chapters, III.3–6, feature, topics, that, are, at, best, loosely, connected, with, the, theme, of, good, prose, style;, among, these, topics, is, the, opposite, of, good, style,, namely, frigid, or, deterring, style, (psuchron), (III.3),, the, simile,, which, turns, out, to, be, connected, with, the, metaphor, (III.4),, the, issue, of, correct, Greek, (III.5),, the, appropriateness, (III.7), and, the, means, by, which, one's, style, becomes, long-winded, and, dignified, (III.6)., Chapters, III.8–9, introduce, two, new, approaches, to, the, issue, of, style,, which, seem, to, be, unrelated, to, everything, that, has, been, said, so, far:, These, are, the, topics, of, the, rhythmical, shaping, of, prose, style, and, of, periodic, and, non-periodic, flow, of, speech., Chapters, III.10–11, are, dedicated, to, how, the, orator, can, ‘bring, things, before, one's, eyes’,, which, amounts, to, something, like, making, the, style, more, vivid., Again, metaphors, are, shown, to, play, a, crucial, role, for, that, purpose,, so, that, the, topic, of, metaphor, is, taken, up, again, and, deepened, by, extended, lists, of, examples., Chapter, III.12, seems, to, make, a, new, start, by, distinguishing, between, oral, and, written, style, and, assessing, their, suitability, for, the, three, genres, of, speech, (see, above, §2)., The, philosophical, core, of, Aristotle's, treatise, on, style, in, Rhet., III.1–12, seems, to, be, included, in, the, discussion, of, the, good, prose, style, (see, below, §8.1),, however, it, is, the, topic, of, metaphor, (see, below, §8.2), that, has, attracted, the, most, attention, in, the, later, reception, up, to, the, present, day., 8.1, The, Virtue, of, Style, Originally, the, discussion, of, style, belongs, to, the, art, of, poetry, rather, than, to, rhetoric;, the, poets, were, the, first,, as, Aristotle, observes,, to, give, an, impulse, for, the, study, of, style., Nevertheless, he, admits, that, questions, of, style, or,, more, precisely,, of, different, ways, to, formulate, the, same, subject,, may, have, an, impact, on, the, degree, of, clarity:, “What, concerns, the, topic, of, lexis,, however,, has, some, small, necessary, place, in, all, teaching;, for, to, speak, in, one, way, rather, than, another, makes, some, difference, in, regard, to, clarity;, although, not, a, great, difference…”, (Rhet., III.1,, 1404a8–10)., Clarity, again, matters, for, comprehension, and, comprehensibility, contributes, to, persuasiveness., Indeed, Aristotle, even, claims, that, the, virtue, or, excellence, (aretê), of, prose, style, ultimately, depends, on, clarity,, because, it, is, the, genuine, purpose, of, a, speech, is, to, make, something, clear., In, prose, speeches,, the, good, formulation, of, a, state, of, affairs, must, therefore, be, a, clear, one., However,, saying, this, is, not, yet, enough, to, account, for, the, best, or, excellent, prose, style,, since, clear, linguistic, expressions, tend, to, be, banal, or, flat,, while, good, style, should, avoid, such, banality., If, the, language, becomes, too, banal, it, will, not, be, able, to, attract, the, attention, of, the, audience., The, orator, can, avoid, this, tendency, of, banality, by, the, use, of, dignified, or, elevated, expressions, and, in, general, by, all, formulations, that, deviate, from, common, usage., On, the, one, hand,, uncommon, vocabulary, has, the, advantage, of, evoking, the, curiosity, of, an, audience., On, the, other, hand, the, use, of, such, elevated, vocabulary, bears, a, serious, risk:, Whenever, the, orator, makes, excessive, use, of, it,, the, speech, might, become, unclear,, thus, failing, to, meet, the, default, requirement, of, prose, speech,, namely, clarity., Moreover,, if, the, vocabulary, becomes, too, sublime, or, dignified, in, relation, to, prose's, subject, matter, (Aristotle, assumes, it, is, mostly, everyday, affairs),, the, audience, will, notice, that, the, orator, uses, his, words, with, a, certain, intention, and, will, become, suspicious, about, the, orator, and, his, intentions., Hitting, upon, the, right, wording, is, therefore, a, matter, of, being, clear,, but, not, too, banal;, In, trying, not, to, be, too, banal,, one, must, use, uncommon,, dignified, words, and, phrases,, but, one, must, be, careful, not, to, use, them, excessively, or, inappropriately, in, relation, to, prose, style, and, the, typical, subject, matter, of, prose, speeches., Bringing, all, these, considerations, together, Aristotle, defines, the, good, prose, style,, i.e., the, virtue, of, prose, style,, as, follows:, “Let, the, virtue, of, linguistic, form, be, defined, as, being, clear,, for, since, the, logos, is, a, (linguistic,, sc.), sign,, it, would, fail, to, bring, about, its, proper, function,, whenever, it, does, not, make, clear, (whatever, it, is, the, sign, of,, sc.)—and, neither, banal/mean/flat, (tapeinên), nor, above, the, deserved, dignity,, but, appropriate, (prepon).”, (Rhet., III.2,, 1404b1–4;, similar, at, III.12,, 1414a22–26), According, to, this, definition,, the, virtue, of, prose, style, has, to, avoid, two, opposed, tendencies,, both, of, which, are, excessive, and, therefore, fallacious:, The, good, style, is, clear, in, a, way, that, is, neither, too, banal, nor, too, dignified,, but, appropriate, (in, proportion, to, the, subject, matter, of, prose, speech)., In, this, respect, the, definition, of, stylistic, virtue, follows, the, same, scheme, as, the, definition, of, ethical, virtues, in, Aristotle's, ethical, writings,, insofar, as, both, the, stylistic, virtue, and, the, virtue, of, character, are, defined, in, terms, of, a, mean, that, lies, between, two, opposed, excesses., If, the, virtue, of, style, is, defined, as, a, mean, between, the, banality, involving, form, of, clarity, and, overly, dignified, (and, hence, inappropriate), speech,, it, is, with, good, reason, that, Aristotle, speaks, of, only, one, virtue, of, prose, style,, and, not, of, clarity,, ornament, (by, dignified, expressions), and, appropriateness, as, three, distinct, virtues, of, style., However,, from, the, times, of, Cicero, and, Quintilianus, on,, these, three,, along, with, the, correctness, of, Greek, or, Latin,, became, the, canonical, four, virtues, of, speech, (virtutes, dicendi)., Reading, Aristotle, through, the, spectacles, of, the, Roman, art, of, rhetoric,, scholars, often, try, to, identify, two,, three, or, four, virtues, of, style, in, his, Rhetoric., Finally,, if, the, virtue, of, style, is, about, finding, a, balance, between, banal, clarity,, which, is, dull,, and, attractive, dignity,, which, is, inappropriate, in, public, speeches,, how, can, the, orator, manage, to, control, the, different, degrees, of, clarity, and, dignity?, For, this, purpose, Aristotle, equips, the, orator, with, a, classification, of, words, (more, or, less, the, same, classification, can, also, be, found, in, Poetics, chapter, 21):, First, of, all, Aristotle, distinguishes, between, the, kuria, onamata,, the, standard, expressions,, and, the, glôtta,, the, borrowed, words,, idioms, or, vernacular, expressions., Most, examples, that, Aristotle, gives, of, this, latter, class, are, taken, from, the, different, Greek, dialects,, and, most, examples, of, this, type, are, in, turn, taken, from, the, language, of, the, Homeric, epos., Further, classes, are, defined, by, metaphors, and, by, several, expressions, that, are, somehow, altered, or, modified,, e.g.,, newly, coined, expressions, (pepoiêmena),, composite, expressions, (especially, new, or, unusual, compositions, (ta, dipla)),, and, lengthened,, shortened, or, otherwise, altered, expressions., Sometimes, Aristotle, also, uses, the, term, kosmos, under, which, he, collects, all, epithets, and, otherwise, ornamental, expressions., These, different, types, of, words, differ, in, accordance, with, their, familiarity., Most, familiar, are, the, usual, or, current, words,, the, least, familiar, words, are, the, glôtta, or, words, that, are, newly, coined., The, metaphors, are, also, unknown, and, unusual,, because, a, usual,, well-known, word, is, used, to, designate, something, other, than, its, usual, designation, (see, below, §8.2)., The, best, established, words,, the, kuria,, make, their, subject, clear,, but, do, not, excite, the, audience's, curiosity,, whereas, all, other, types, of, words, are, not, established,, and, hence, have, the, sort, of, attraction, that, alien, or, foreign, things, used, to, have., Since, remote, things, are, admirable, (thaumaston), and, the, admirable, is, pleasant,, Aristotle, says,, one, should, make, the, speech, admirable, and, pleasant, by, the, use, of, such, unfamiliar, words., However, one, has, to, be, careful, not, to, use, inappropriately, dignified, or, poetic, words, in, prose, speech., Thus, the, virtue, of, style, is, accomplished, by, the, selection, and, balanced, use, of, these, various, types, of, words:, Fundamental, for, prose, speech, is, the, use, of, usual, and, therefore, clear, words., In, order, to, make, the, speech, pleasant, and, dignified, and, in, order, to, avoid, banality, the, orator, must, make, moderate, use, of, non-familiar, elements., Metaphor, plays, an, important, role, for, prose, style,, since, metaphors, contribute,, as, Aristotle, says,, clarity, as, well, as, the, unfamiliar,, surprising, effect, that, avoids, banality, and, tediousness., 8.2, Aristotelian, Metaphors, According, to, Aristotle, Poetics, 21,, 1457b9–16, and, 20–22,, a, metaphor, is, “the, application, of, an, alien, name, by, transference, either, from, genus, to, species,, or, from, species, to, genus,, or, from, species, to, species,, or, by, analogy,, that, is,, proportion”., These, four, types, are, exemplified, as, follows:, Type, Example, Explanation, (i), From, genus, to, species, There, lies, my, ship, Lying, at, anchor, is, a, species, of, the, genus, “lying”, (ii), From, species, to, genus, Verily, ten, thousand, noble, deeds, hath, Odysseus, wrought, Ten, thousand, is, a, species, of, the, genus, “large, number”, (iii), From, species, to, species, (a), With, blade, of, bronze, drew, away, the, life, (a), “To, draw, away”, is, used, for, “to, cleave”,  ,  , (b), Cleft, the, water, with, the, vessel, of, unyielding, bronze, (b), “To, cleave”, is, used, for, “to, draw, away.”, Both,, to, draw, away, and, to, cleave,, are, species, of, “taking, away”, (iv), From, analogy, (a), To, call, the, cup, “the, shield, of, Dionysus”, (a), The, cup, is, to, Dionysus, as, the, shield, to, Ares,  ,  , (b), To, call, the, shield, “the, cup, of, Ares”, (b), The, shield, is, to, Ares, as, the, cup, to, Dionysus, Most, of, the, examples, Aristotle, offers, for, types, (i), to, (iii), would, not, be, regarded, as, metaphors, in, the, modern, sense;, rather, they, would, fall, under, the, headings, of, metonomy, or, synecdoche., The, examples, offered, for, type, (iv), are, more, like, modern, metaphors., Aristotle, himself, regards, the, metaphors, of, group, (iv),, which, are, built, from, analogy,, as, the, most, important, type, of, enthymemes., An, analogy, is, given, if, the, second, term, is, to, the, first, as, the, fourth, to, the, third., Correspondingly,, an, analogous, metaphor, uses, the, fourth, term, for, the, second, or, the, second, for, the, fourth., This, principle, can, be, illustrated, by, the, following, Aristotelian, examples:,  , Analogy, Metaphor, (a), The, cup, to, Dionysus, as, shield, to, Ares., To, call, the, cup, “the, shield, of, Dionysus”, or, the, shield, “the, cup, of, Ares”, is, a, metaphor., (b), Old, age, to, life, as, the, evening, to, day, To, call, old, age, “the, evening, of, the, life”, or, the, evening, “old, age, of, the, day”, is, a, metaphor, (c), Sowing, to, seed, as, X, to, sun, rays,, while, the, action, of, the, sun, in, scattering, his, rays, is, nameless;, still, this, process, bears, to, the, sun, the, same, relation, as, sowing, to, the, seed., To, call, (a, nameless), X, “sowing, of, sun, rays”, is, a, metaphor, by, analogy, (d), =, (a), To, call, the, shield, “a, cup, without, wine”, is, also, a, metaphor, by, analogy., Examples, (a), and, (b), obey, the, optional, instruction, that, metaphors, can, be, qualified, by, adding, the, term, to, which, the, proper, word, is, relative, (cp., “the, shield, of, Ares,”, “the, evening, of, life”)., In, example, (c),, there, is, no, proper, name, for, the, thing, that, the, metaphor, refers, to., In, example, (d), the, relation, of, analogy, is, not,, as, in, the, other, cases,, indicated, by, the, domain, to, which, an, item, is, referred, to,, but, by, a, certain, negation, (for, example, “without, name”);, the, negations, make, clear, that, the, term, is, not, used, in, its, usual, sense., Metaphors, are, closely, related, to, similes;, but, as, opposed, to, the, later, tradition,, Aristotle, does, not, define, the, metaphor, as, an, abbreviated, simile,, but,, the, other, way, around,, the, simile, as, a, metaphor., The, simile, differs, from, the, metaphor, in, the, form, of, expression:, while, in, the, metaphor, something, is, identified, or, substituted,, the, simile, compares, two, things, with, each, other,, using, words, as, “like,”, “as”,, etc., For, example,, “He, rushed, as, a, lion”, is,, according, to, Aristotle,, a, simile,, but, “The, lion, rushed”, is, a, metaphor., While, in, the, later, tradition, the, use, of, metaphors, has, been, seen, as, a, matter, of, mere, decoration,, which, has, to, delight, the, hearer,, Aristotle, stresses, the, cognitive, function, of, metaphors., Metaphors,, he, says,, bring, about, learning, (Rhet., III.10,, 1410b14f.)., In, order, to, understand, a, metaphor,, the, hearer, has, to, find, something, common, between, the, metaphor, and, the, thing, the, metaphor, refers, to., For, example,, if, someone, calls, the, old, age, “stubble”,, we, have, to, find, a, common, genus, to, which, old, age, and, stubble, belong;, we, do, not, grasp, the, very, sense, of, the, metaphor, until, we, find, that, both,, old, age, and, stubble,, have, lost, their, bloom., Thus,, a, metaphor, not, only, refers, to, a, thing,, but, simultaneously, describes, the, thing, in, a, certain, respect., This, is, why, Aristotle, says, that, the, metaphor, brings, about, learning:, as, soon, as, we, understand, why, someone, uses, the, metaphor, “stubble”, to, refer, to, old, age,, we, have, learned, at, least, one, characteristic, of, old, age., Glossary, of, Selected, Terms, Accepted, opinions:, endoxa, Argument:, logos, Art:, technê, Character:, êthos, Counterpart:,
