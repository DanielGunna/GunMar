NPR, DrownedinSound, NME, Spinner, If, that's, not, premature, enough,, we've, now, started, debating, who's, going, to, breakthrough, next, year., One, band, who's, especially, prevalent,, and, deservedly, so,, are, Fixers., Their, songs, vacillate, from, Animal, Collective, style, experimentation, to, Beach, Boys, pop, euphoria., Iron, Deer, Dream, by, Fixers., Another, Lost, Apache, by, Fixers., They're, playing, in, London, at, the, Shacklewell, Arms, on, 16th, August,, tickets, here., It'll, probably, be, your, last, chance, to, catch, them, at, such, a, tiny, venue., Posted, by,

with, a, pebble, beach., Still, you, do, have, the, slight, adventure, of, being, 100s, of, miles, closer, and, still, put, on, probably, the, best, value, music, festival, in, the, UK., The, boat, has, long, sailed, into, the, distance, for, a, full, fest, review,, but, I, really, must, share, this, band, as, they, provided, the, most, enduring, memory, of, the, event., AIAS, hail, from, Barcelona, and, are, signed, to, Captured, Tracks, which, seems, a, pretty, categorical, stamp, of, approval, right, now, (see:, Veronica, Falls,, Dum, Dum, Girls,, Wild, Nothing, et, al)., These, girls, craft, condensed,, lo-fi, surfer-pop, with, scuzzy, guitar, sounds, and, hooks-a-plenty., When, darting, from, venue, to, venue, in, Brighton,, it, was, their, sugary, harmonies, that, I, kept,

the, most, striking, impression, is, how, he, stretches, and, elongates, key, words, to, lend, them, an, immense, poignancy,, regardless, of, subject, matters., The, lyrics, seem, to, cling, desperately, to, the, sides, of, his, mouth, before, slipping, helplessly, into, the, room., Melancholy, is, not, Mr, Leftwich's, only, setting, though;, “Pictures”, displays, a, charming, wit, with,

night,, and, debut, single, “Atlas, Hands”, best, demonstrates, his, understated, charm., It, results, in, an, eruption, of, cheers, and, wolf, howls, from, the, crowd,, which, feel, remarkable, given, the, isolation, he, faces, onstage,, whilst, singing, his, acoustic, laments., I've, got, a, plan, /, I've, got, an, atlas, in, my, hands, /, I'm, gonna, turn, /, When, I, listen, to, the,
