STONE, Dells, 2004, Rock, N', Roll, Hall, Of, Fame, Induction, Party, Email, Soul-Patrol, Last, Updated:, 3/12/2007, SOUL-PATROL, COVERS, THE, ROCK, n', ROLL, HALL, OF, FAME, INDUCTION, CEREMONIES:, Since, Black, Americans, invented, Rock, n', Roll, music,, we, thought, it, was, appropriate, for, us, to, cover, this, event, each, year,, and, give, our, readers, the, TRUTH..., Although, there, is, no, definitive, date, for, the, actual, start, of, Rock, n', Roll,, we, do, know, that, it, started, to, become, popular, in, the, mid, 1950's,, shortly, after, the, famous, Brown, vs., Board, of, Education, US, Supreme, Court, decision,, declaring, that, SEGGREGATION, was, against, the, law, in, the, United, States., If, you, think, about, it,, Rock, n', Roll, as, a, popular, form, of, culture, may, not, have, been, possible,, were, it, not, for, that, decision., During, the, 1950's, Rock, n', Roll, itself, became, a, force, for, integration, of, the, races, and, it, was, the, music, bringing, people, together., Click, on, the, links, to, your, left, to, read, our, yearly, coverage, and, more, about, the, Rock, n', Roll, Hall, of, Fame!, Why, I'm, Not, Covering, The, 2007, RRHOF, Inductions, Each, year, since, 2000, I, have, covered, the, RRHOF, Inductions, in, NYC., This, year, I, decided, not, to, cover, the, RRHOF, Inductions., In, fact,, at, the, very, moment, that, I, find, myself, writing, this, article, I, would, normally, be, in, the, press, room, at, the, Waldorf, Astoria, Hotel., Today, would, have, been, the, day, that, I, would, have, typically, spent, the, day, in, NYC, and, using, a, combination, of, both, legitimate, and, "guerrilla", tactics, out, reported, anyone, else, on, the, scene., I, would, typically, come, back, with, the, interviews,, inside, stories, and, photos, that, nobody, else, could, get., I'd, come, back, with, stories, about, the, shabby, treatment, I, had, received, from, the, security, staff, (I'm, sure, they, will, all, miss, me, this, year.....lol),, despite, having, all, of, my, credentials, in, order, and, despite, me, being, on, a, first, name, basis, with, the, security, officers, after, spending, so, many, years, in, dealing, with, them., And, despite, those, obstacles,, I, would, come, back, year, after, year, with, a, fascinating, account, of, what, had, occurred., Don't, believe, me?, Think, I'm, just, bragging?, It's, all, archived, at, the, following, link:, http://www.soul-patrol.com/rr_index.html, 7, YEARS, OF, SOUL-PATROL.COM, COVERAGE, OF, THE, ROCK, N', ROLL, HALL, OF, FAME, INDUCTIONS, The, only, other, time, I, didn't, go,, when, I, had, the, chance, to, was, to, protest, my, outrage, about, the, lily, white, selections, that, year,, and, I, was, quite, passionate, &, vocal, about, it., This, year, I, didn't, go, simply, because, I, wasn't, interested., The, reason, I, wasn't, interested, in, 2007,, is, because, I, felt, like, the, Hall, itself, wasn't, interested, in, making, sure, that, there, are, honoree's, that, inspire, and, provoke, passion, for, 2007., The, reason, why, I, thought, about, this, today, is, because, in, addition, to, giving, up, my, "yearly, honor, of, being, the, only, Black, man, in, the, press, room, at, the, RRHOF, Induction, Ceremonies",, I, am, also, giving, up, what, I, refer, to, under, my, breath..., "One, of, the, 10, days, each, year, when, Soul-Patrol.com, is, one, of, the, most, important/influential, publications, in, the, music, industry...", And, the, reasons, for, that, are:, -, The, RRHOF, Inductions, have, always, been, important, to, the, music, industry., -, Soul-Patrol.com, always, finds, the, "real, story", behind, the, "headlines, &, the, hype", and, reports, that, story, in, an, honest, and, passionate, manner, that, REAL, music, fans, truly, appreciate., That's, the, reason, why, if, you, go, to, your, favorite, search, engine, and, type, in, the, search, term:, "rock, n', roll, hall, of, fame", -, Soul-Patrol.com, comes, up, as, #3, in, Google, -, Soul-Patrol.com, comes, up, #5, in, Yahoo, This, year's, selections, are, all, pretty, shaky, at, best, and, for, me, lack, anything, worth, reaching, back, for, the, energy, to, dig, deep, for, the, REAL, story., Oh, don't, get, me, wrong,, these, years', choices, of:, Grandmaster, Flash, and, the, Furious, Five,, R.E.M.,, The, Ronettes,, Patti, Smith,, Van, Halen, all, belong, in, the, RRHOF, (except, for, Patti, Smith)., So, I, am, not, "outraged", at, any, of, the, selections., Oh, sure, I, could, have, found, a, story,, I, could, have, reported, on, Grandmaster, Flash, being, the, first, hip, hop, honoree,, or, the, ongoing, internal, drama, plaguing, Van, Halen, and/or, the, Ronnettes., Those, are, all, legitimate, stories., However, none, of, them, are, compelling., You, can, find, those, stories, in, the, mainstream, media, pretty, easily., Tonight, they, are, going, to, have, a, tribute, to, James, Brown,, which, is, a, very, nice, thing, for, the, Induction, Committee, to, do., However, after, witnessing, what, I, saw, at, the, Apollo, in, the, days, after, James, Brown's, passing, any, other, tribute, to, Mr., Brown, is, going, to, pale, in, comparison., There, isn't, anything, there, for, me, to, get, all, worked, up, over,, one, way, or, the, other., Rock, n', Roll, is, something, that, Americans, have, traditionally, been, "passionate", about., We, not, only, love, the, music,, we, love, talking, about, it,, we, love, arguing, about, it, and, we, love, it's, ongoing, legacy., We, relate, to, it, on, a, personal, level, because, not, only, can, we, identify, with, certain, artists,, we, even, think, that, certain, artists, are, in, some, ways, reflective, of, our, own, personalities., We, think, that, Rock, n', Roll, is, a, part, of, us, and, we, think, that, we, are, part, of, it., Rock, n', Roll, is, in, many, ways, the, thread, that, ties, the, American, Quilt, together., It, transcends, demographics, like, race,, geography,, age,, etc., and, today, 1/2, century, after, it's, first, burst, of, popularity,, it, still, has, the, power, to, bring, people, together, in, a, way, that, can, make, us, smile., On, an, academic, front,, it, tells, the, story, of, America, in, a, microcosm, and, it, finds, a, kind, of, harmonic, convergence, in, both, the, good, and, bad, in, America, that, leaves, one, with, the, hope, that, America, will, one, day, reach, it's, full, potential, as, a, nation., Rock, n', Roll, embraces, controversy,, although, it, rarely, provides, concrete, answers,, it, usually, ends, up, providing, a, sense, of, direction., And, sometimes, just, having, that, sense, of, direction, has, been, a, tremendous, enabler, for, positive, changes,, that, bring, America, much, closer, to, achieving, it's, potential, for, greatness., That's, because, the, spirit, of, Rock, n', Roll, is, something, that, is, very, close, to, being, at, the, core, of, what, "American, values", are, supposed, to, be., The, Rock, n', Roll, Hall, of, Fame, Museum, is, an, important, institution, because, it, seeks, to, (and, largely, succeeds), in, documenting, all, of, this,, the, good,, the, bad, &, the, ugly., It, takes, what, is, essentially, American, Folk, Art,, created, from, an, amalgamation, of, multiple, folk, arts, and, elevates, it, to, something, that, the, rest, of, the, world, envy's., The, RRHOF, Induction, Ceremony, takes, the, concept, of, the, museum, to, an, even, higher, level,, because, it, gives, us, a, day, that, allows, us, to, focus, on, who, are, the, "best, of, the, best", for, that, year, in, the, entire, history, of, the, "American, Folk, Art", known, as, "Rock, n', Roll"., In, some, ways, each, year's, class, is, thought, to, be, a, microcosm, of, the, entire, history, what, the, institution, represents., Even, with, a, very, flawed, selection, process,, typically, each, years, selections, generates, a, huge, amount, of, passion,, even, when, people, totally, disagree, with, the, selections., However, in, 2007, that, is, not, the, case., In, 2007, none, of, the, selections, generates, much, if, any, passion., I'm, certain, some, will, disagree., However, there, is, no, passion, this, year., And, that, is, a, shame., Whoever, thought, the, day, would, come, when, that, could, be, said, about, the, RRHOF, Induction, Ceremonies?, --Bob, Davis, earthjuice@prodigy.net, 2006, Rock, n', Roll, Hall, of, Fame, Inductions, Just, got, in, from, NYC, for, our, coverage, of, the, 2006, RRHOF, Inductions., I'm, whipped, (as, you, can, see, from, the, look, on, my, face, in, that, picture, of, me, with, the, legendary, Clarence, Clemmons), and, I, gotta, go, to, work, in, the, morning, so, here, is, a, quickie, summary, of, what, we, did:, -, Interview, with, the, family, of, Miles, Davis, +, drummer, Lenny, White, -, Interview, David, Peck, &, Rob, Bowman, ("The, Real, Thing:, In, Performance, 1964-1981"), -, Press, conferences, with:, The, Davis, family,, Herbie, Hancock,, Herb, Alpert, &, Jerry, Moss, &, Leela, James, -, Hung, out, with, the, Davis, family, &, Wallace, Roney, at, the, Village, Vanguard, I, was, glad, to, have, our, friend, Greer, Brooks-Muldoon, was, on, board, to, help, me, out, since, she, is, such, a, big, Miles, fan, and, because, of, her, knowledge, of, some, of, the, artists, that, I, didn't, really, have, a, detailed, knowledge, of:, It, was, kinda, cool, to, watch, the, reaction, from, the, folks, in, the, Miles, Davis, camp, to, meeting, her, in, person,, since, they, only, knew, her, as, "HALFaTrip", from, the, "Dark, Magus", page, on, the, soul-patrol.com, website:, http://www.soul-patrol.com/jazz/magus.htm, A, few, things, we, didn't, get, to, do, that, I, wanted, to..., -, Didn't, get, to, talk, with, Lynyrd, Skynyrd, (I, wanted, to, ask, them, if, there, could, ever, come, a, time, when, they, could, stop, using, the, imagery, of, the, Confederate, flag), -, Didn't, get, to, talk, with, Herbie, Hancock, (I, wanted, to, ask, him, about, the, thought, process, behind, the, composition, of, the, Miles, tribute, band), -, Didn't, get, to, talk, with, Metalica, (I, wanted, to, ask, them, about, the, status, of, their, anti, file, sharing, case), Overall,, this, was, the, very, worst, RRHOF, Inductions, I, have, attended,, in, my, six, years, of, covering, the, event:, -, As, you, all, know, this, was, a, very, weak, set, of, artists, -, It, was, disorganized, -, It, was, shallow, -, Everything, was, kept, a, secret, till, the, last, possible, moment, BEST, THINGS:, The, two, hour, long, interview, with, the, Davis, family, &, Lenny, White., The, rehearsal, for, the, Wilson, Pickett, Tribute., Talking, with, Clarence, Clemons., Peck/Bowman, Interview, WORST, THING:, The, decision, not, to, use, more, of, the, available, players, from, the, Miles, Davis, 70's, band, as, a, part, of, the, Miles, Davis, Tribute, Soul-Patrol, Celebrates, Miles, Davis, Induction, Into, The, Rock, n', Roll, Hall, of, Fame, We, also, did, a, special, edition, of, the, Soul-Patrol, Newsletter, that, focused, on, the, 1970's, period, of, Miles, Davis, career., We, review, some, of, the, key, albums, and, also, do, a, special, internet, radio, broadcast, of, one, of, Miles's, LIVE, albums, from, that, period., I, knew, that, since, the, announcement, was, initially, made, about, Miles, Davis, being, inducted, into, the, RRHOF,, that, it, hadn't, been, treated, properly., In, fact, there, were, those, who, had, even, tried, to, marginalize, the, accomplishment, by, saying, things, like..., Miles,, yeah, he, should, be, in, a, jazz, hall, of, fame,, but, NOT, the, RRHOF.., The, event, will, be, televised, on, VH-1., If, you, watch:, -, I'm, sure, that, they, will, clean, up, the, "mess", via, the, magic, of, editing, -, Don't, believe, the, "hype"., It, was, awful, Hopefully, next, year, they, will, address, some, of, these, issues..., --Bob, Davis, (3/14/2006:, 3am), RRHOF, 2006, -, Miles, Beyond:, Inteview, with, the, Family, of, Miles, Davis:, Vince, Wilburn, Jr,, Vince, Wilburn, Sr,, Lenny,
