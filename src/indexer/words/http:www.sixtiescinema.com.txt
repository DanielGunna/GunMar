Thrett:, From, Where, No, Man, Has, Gone, Before, to, The, Wild, Wild, West, January, 17th,, 2017, in, Uncategorized, 5, Comments, »,  ,  , In, my, upcoming, book, Talking, Sixties, Drive-In, Movies, from, BearManor, Media,, actress, Maggie, Thrett, talks, about, her, film, appearances, and, especially, about, making, the, hit, drive-in, movie, Three, in, the, Attic, (1968), written, by, Stephen, Yafa, and, starring, Christopher, Jones,, Yvette, Mimieux,, and, Judy, Pace., However,, she, is, probably, most, remembered, for, her, guest, appearance in, “Mudd’s, Women”, on, Star, Trek, earlier, in, her, career, and, some, of, her, other, TV, roles., Maggie, Thrett, was, born, Diane, Pine, in, New, York, City., She, had, a, natural, gift, for, singing, and, in, junior, high, school, was, chosen, to, be, part, of, the, All, City, Glee, Club., She, then, attended, the, High, School, for, the, Performing, Arts, and, began, working, as, a, model, after, accompanying, a, tall, beautiful, Israeli, classmate, to, her, modeling, agency, Plaza, Five., One, look, at, the, attractive, gal, with, long, luxurious, dark, hair, and, they, signed, her, as, a, client., Her, first, appearance, in, Harper’s, Bazaar, had, her, modeling, street, clothes, accompanied, by, actor, Michael, J., Pollard., Soon, after, she, was, gracing, their, cover., She, then, signed, with, the, more, prestigious, agency, Eileen, Ford, while, continuing, her, singing, career., At, age, thirteen,, she, had, a, record, out, called, “Your, Love, Is, Mine”, with, the, B-side, “Lucky, Girl.”, Bob, Crewe, (most, famous, for, writing, a, number, of, hits, for, The, Four, Seasons), was, taken, with, the, aspiring, singer, when, she, was, dancing, at, the, Greenwich, Village, discotheque, Trude, Heller’s, the, year, she, graduated, high, school., He, produced, her, next, single, called, “Soupy”, for, his, label, DynoVoice, Records,, but, he, changed, her, name, to, Maggie, Thrett, because, “he, thought, it, sounded, British, and, more, with, it, for, the, time.”, During, this, period, Maggie, reveals, that, she, was, ensconced, in, an, unhappy, abusive, marriage, to, a, wannabe, actor., He, got, an, audtion, for, Universal, Pictures, and, Thrett, agreed, to, read, opposite, him, when, his, partner, dropped, out, at, the, last, minute., As, luck, would, have, it,, she, got, signed, and, sent, to, Hollywood,, while, he, was, sent, packing., With, her, long, brown,, hair, which, she, refuse, to, cut,, the, beautiful, actress, was, able, to, play, various, ethnic, types, such, as, Mexicans, or, native, Americans, mostly, on, television., Her, first, film, for, the, studio, was, the, beach/spy, spoof, Out, of, Sight , (1966), starring, Jonathan, Pine,, Karen, Jensen,, and, Shindig, dancer, Carole, Shelyne., Maggie, played, the, karate-chopping, F.L.U.S.H., assassin, Wipeout, who, arrives, in, Malibu, on, a, surfboard, from, Hawaii., They, then, gave, her, a, role, in, an, episode, of, Run, for, Your, Life, starring, Ben, Gazzara., There, she, met, future, husband, actor, Donnelly, Rhodes., “We, met, at, the, Montecito, Hotel, where, Universal, Studios, first, put, me, up, when, I, cam, to, Los, Angeles., He, was, married, at, the, time., We, didn’t, get, together, until, later., He, was, nice, and, Ben, was, too.”, Next, came, her, most, notable, role, that, of, Ruth,, a, gorgeous, alien, humanoid,, in, “Mudd’s, Women”, on, Star, Trek, for, which, she, is, most, remembered, for, to, this, day., This, episode, was, directed, by, Harvey, Hart., It, was, one, of, three, scripts, submitted, to, be, the, second, pilot, however, the, adult, content, worried, NBC., It, was, the, sixth, episode, aired., I, was, living, in, an, apartment, on, Larrabee, Street, in, Hollywood., Roger, C., Carmel, lived, downstairs., It, was, a, coincidence, we, both, wound, up, cast., I, had, no, idea, what, this, show, was, because, it, was, only, the, second, episode, they, did, [third, if, you, count, the, original, pilot, with, Jeffrey, Hunter]., I, had, to, read, for, the, part, and, got, it., I, never, got, any, role, through, connections., It, was, all, by, going, in, for, the, interview, and, auditioning., The, entire, cast, was, really, nice., I, never, saw, any, friction, between, any, of, the, actors., William, Shatner, was, very, polite, to, me, and, a, very, pleasant, guy., Susan, Denberg, was, a, German, girl, and, she, was, a, bit, strange., Karen, Steele, was, easier, to, get, to, know, and, her, boyfriend, actor, Michael, Rennie, would, visit, her, on, the, set., I, thought, he, was, actually, there, to, see, if, he, could, get, a, job, on, the, series., And, of, course, I, was, already, friends, with, Roger, C., Carmel, who, was, my, neighbor., He, was, always, very, entertaining, and, a, really, good, character, actor., We, had, a, good, cast, and, a, good, director, with, Harvey, Hart., I, thought, this, show, was, more, adult, then, the, other, sci-fi, shows on, the, air, at, the, time., Our, episode, dealt, with, these, women, who, was, so, desperate, to, remain, young, and, beautiful, that, they, would, take, a, drug, just, to, give, them, the, illusion, of, beauty., They, had, no, self-worth, and, thought, their, looks, were, the, only, thing, going, for, them. [This, episode, smartly, touched, on, the, way, women, were, made, to, feel, as, they, matured., Hollywood, was, the, worst, offender, and, if, an, actress, had, not, made, it, by, thirty, they, were, considered, too, old, and, put, out, to, pasture.], I, had, no, complaints, about, my, costume, here, and, apparently, nobody, else, did, either., What, they, give, you, is, what, you, wear, but, here, it, was, better, than, usual., The, makeup, part, was, tough, when, we, age., They, put, duo, surgical, paste, on, our, faces—like, six, coats, of, it, to, shrivel, you, up., I, remember, getting, it, off, at, night, was, just, raw., When, we, filmed, these, scenes, I, remember, we, hit, Golden, Overtime, that, day., We, were, there, from, about, 4, in, the, morning, to, about, 9, or, 10, at, night., You, are, passed, regular, overtime, and, are, into, triple, overtime., They, didn’t, want, to, pay., I, had, to, fight, for, it, through, the, Screen, Actors, Guild., They, don’t, like, when, you, do, that, and, hurts, your, chances, to, be, on, the, show, again., I, got, my, money, and, no, surprise, was, never, invited, back., Years, later, I, got, a, letter, from, Gene, Roddenberry, to, forfeit, my, residuals, and, to, donate, them, to, his, charity., I, declined., As, Ruth,, Maggie, Thrett, looked, stunning, in, her, tight, emerald, green, sparkling, gown, as, one, of, the, three, loveliest, women, (the, others, being, Karen, Steele, and, Susan, Denberg), in, the, universe, who, mesmerize, the, male, crew, members, of, the, Enterprise., The, gals, are, cargo, being, transported, by, Roger, C., Carmel’s, Henry, Mudd, who, acts, an, intergalactic, pimp, providing, brides, to, lonely, men., Ruth, especially, beguiles, Dr,, McCoy, and, drops, in, on, sick, bay, to, get, information, on, the, lithium, crystal, miners, on, the, planet, the, Enterprise, is, en-route, to., While, there, she, inadvertently, sets, off, McCoy’s, medical, scanner,, which, baffles, him., Turns, out, the, gals’, hypnotic, effect, on, men, comes, from, a, Venus, drug, that, transforms, them, from, decrepit, hags, to, glamour, girls., When, the, drug, begins, to, wear, off,, Ruth, is, desperate, for, Mudd, to, find, the, hidden, pills, so, she, can, go, back, to, the, illusion, of, beauty, to, snare, one, of, the, miners., Maggie, gives, one, of, her, finest, performances, here, as, the, intense, frantic, Ruth, who, cannot, bare, to, return, to, her, true, self., I, am, shocked, that, years, later, I, am, best, known, for, doing, this, episode., I, am, forever, in, TV, history., At, least, it, was, not, bad, so, I, am, not, embarrassed, by, it., Some, company, contacted, me, to, sell, my, autograph, on, these, Star, Trek, cards., They, pay, me, to, and, they, resell, at, these, Star, Trek, conventions., I, was, invited, once, but, it, didn’t, work, out., I, think, living, in, New, York, hurts, because, they, are, usually, on, the, West, Coast., Maggie, Thrett, next, turned, up, twice, on, The, Wild, Wild, West, but, her, time, there, was, not, as, enjoyable, due, to, star, Robert, Conrad:,  He, was, the, only, lead, actor, I, didn’t, like, and, he, was, a, real, prick., You, don’t, have, to, be, tall, to, be, nice., He, worked, all, the, time, and, I, do, not, know, what, his, problem, was, about, his, height., Conrad, also, didn’t, like, to, rehearse, any, scenes, and, wouldn’t, run, lines., He, was, only, interested, in, the, action, scenes, and, those, were, the, only, scenes, he, would, rehearse., I, didn’t, get, it., Ross, Martin,, on, the, other, hand,, was, a, doll, and, he, was, the, better, actor., He, was, a, professional, and, ran, lines, with, us, like, you, are, suppose, to, do.,  , On, the, second, episode, that, louse, Conrad,, who, was, married,, came, on, to, me., It, was, like, you, belong, to, me, because, you, are, on, my, show., I, said,, ‘I’m, too, old, for, you., I, heard, you, like, younger, girls.’, I, was, eighteen, at, the, time., When, I, wouldn’t, go, back, to, his, trailer, with, him,, he, had, me, replaced, in, a, love, scene, we, were, supposed, to, do, in, the, moonlight, where, he, kisses, me., I, didn’t, care, because, I, had, enough, scenes, and, it, didn’t, really, matter., Thrett’s, two, episodes, were, “The, Night, of, the, Freebooters”, where, she, played, soft-spoken, Rita, Leon,, a, Mexican, whose, husband, is, being, held, prisoner, by, the, Freebooters,, a, renegade, army, led, by, Thorald, Wolfe, (Keenan, Wynn), set, to, invade, and, claim, Mexico’s, Baja,, California., “The, Night, of, the, Running, Death”, gave, Thrett, more, to, do, as, a, dancer, named, Deirdre, (a.k.a., Topaz), who, has, a, passion, for, molasses-covered, Cherries, Jubilee, and, is, the, girlfriend, of, assassin, Enzo, (played, by, female, impersonator, T.C., Jones)., She, fakes, her, death, in, order, to, aid, Enzo,, masquerading, as, a, female, British, schoolteacher,, in, killing, a, princess., As, a, disguised, Dierdre, goes, to, shoot, her,, agent, Artemus, Gordon, (Ross, Martin), comes, up, from, behind, her, and, grabs, her, arm,, deflecting, the, shot., He, then, says, to, his, partner, James, West, (Robert, Conrad),, “Let, me, present, our, dear, friend, Topaz, to, you, James., We, know, her, better, as, Deirdre.”, Artemus, then, rips, off, her, veil, and, quips,, “And, we, gave, you, such, a, nice, funeral.”, Continuing, in, the, western, genre, she, played, Indian, maidens, on, two, TV, shows., The, long, forgotten, 1967, summer, series, Dundee, and, the, Culhane, starred, John, Mills, as, an, English, lawyer, partnered, with, American, Sean, Garrison, bringing, “frontier, justice”, to, folks, in, the, Old, West., Sort, of, a, Perry, Mason, on, horseback., Her, episode, was, “The, Death, of, a, Warrior, Brief”, and, also, guest, starred, James, Dunn, and, Gus, Trikonis., I, remember, this, because, I, thought, Sean, Garrison, was, such, a, weird, nasty, guy., Also, because, we, shot, on, location, in, Arizona, and, it, was, like, 120, degrees., They, hired, real, native, Americans, as, extras., Flies, were, swarming, around, them, and, they, were, used, to, it., I, couldn’t, believe, it., It, was, interesting, interacting, with, them., More, remembered, was, Cimarron, Strip, starring, Stuart, Whitman, (“another, really, nice, guy,”, exclaimed, Thrett), as, a, US, marshal, enforcing, the, law, in, the, Kansas, territory., In, “Heller”, Thrett, played, Red, Deer, part, of, an, Indian, tribe, being, harassed, by, an, outlaw, gang., Tuesday, Weld, also, appeared, playing, a, woman, who, is, part, of, the, gang, but, turns, against, them, to, help, Whitman’s, marshal, because, as, a, child, she, was, raised, by, Indians, and, has, sympathy, for, them., As, Red, Deer,, Thrett, has, one, gripping, moment, when, she, shames, the, men, in, her, tribe, that, won’t, help, the, marshal, track, down, the, outlaw, gang., I, lied, to, get, this, part., I, said, I, had, been, on, a, horse, and, that, I, owned, brown, contact, lens., That, weekend, before, filming, began, I, had, to, go, out, and, buy, a, pair,, and, went, to, a, stable, to, learn, how, to, get, on, and, off, a, horse., I, got, away, with, it., Thrett, also, made, appearances, on, the, TV, series, I, Dream, of, Jeannie;, McCloud, (“I, played, Godiva, and, rode, through, the, park, actually, topless, with, my, hair, covering, my, breasts”);, and, The, Most, Deadly, Game, working, once, again, with, Yvette, Mimieux, (“I, don’t, remember, her, on, this, but, do, recall, George, Maharis, because, he, wore, false, eyelashes., He, was, the, first, actor, I, ever, worked, with, that, wore, them., It, made, him, look, pretty”)., Maggie, Thrett’s, last, TV, role, was, in, an, episode, of, the, cult, series, Run,, Joe,, Run, in, 1974, with, then, husband, Donnelly, Rhodes, about, a, military, trained, German, Shepherd, named, Joe, falsely, accused, of, attacking, his, Sergeant., The, canine, goes, on, the, run, and, winds, up, helping, people, he, encounters, while, being, pursued., It, was, like, a, four-legged, version, of, The, Fugitive., “Funny,, I, do, not, recall, this, show, at, all., Donnelly, and, I, lived, together, first, and, then, got, married, in, Tijuana.”, Maggie, Thrett, then, abandoned, acting, to, concentrate, on, her, musical, career, where, as, Diane, Pine, she, was, a, very, successful, backup, singer, in, the, studio, and, on, stage., She, left, show, business, the, mid-eighties, choosing, a, life, of, domesticity., Maggie, Three, is, also, profiled, in, my, and, Louis, Paul’s, book, Film, Fatales:, Women, in, Espionage, Film, and, Television,, 1962-1973.,  , FAREWELL, FRANCINE!, January, 7th,, 2017, in, Uncategorized, No, Comments, →,  , I, learned, today, the, sad, news, that, actress, Francine, York, passed, away, this, morning, Jan., 6,, 2017, from, Cancer., Seems, she, was, secretly, struggling, with, the, disease, for, over, a, year., Based, on, her, cheery, Facebook, posts, and, drive, to, keep, working,, you, would, never, have, guessed, it., That, is, why, it, came, as, such, a, shock, for, most, of, her, fans., I, wrote, to, Francine, in, the, late, nineties, to, do, a, career, interview, for, my, first, book, Fantasy, Femmes, of, Sixties, Cinema., She, called, me, and, said,, “I, have, been, waiting, for, you, for, years., What, took, you, so, long!, I, have, a, whole, lot, to, say!”, And, boy, did, she., A, writer’s, dream,, Francine, had, stories, from, just, about, every, movie, and, TV, show, she, worked, on., Outspoken,, funny,, and, sometimes, a, bit, boastful but, in, a, sweet, way,, she, regaled, me, with, anecdotes, about, Jerry, Lewis,, Marlon, Brando,, Elvis, Presley,, George, Peppard,, and, her, iconic, TV, appearances, on, Batman,, Lost, in, Space,, Bewitched, and, so, much, more. Completely, candid,, if, Francine, liked, you, she, praised, you, to, the, hilt,, but, if, you, wronged, her, she, was, not, afraid, to, call, you, to, task, (hear, that, Tony, Randall)., She, told, me, about, her, infamous, wall, of, fame, in, her, apartment, that, she, so, wanted, me, to, see, with, photos, from, her, career., When, she auditioned, for, the, 70s, Saturday, morning, TV, show, Jason, of, Star, Command,, per, Francine, the, casting, director, asked, if, she, could, play, a, queen,, and, she, replied,, “I, am, the, Queen!”, Naturally, she, got, the, part., Francine, and, I, stayed, in, touch, ever, since., I, will, miss, receiving, her, wonderful, photo, Christmas, cards, each, year., She, hated,
