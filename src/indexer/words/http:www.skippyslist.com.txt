have, been, warned., One, upon, a, time, I, was, a, teenager.,  And, like, most, teenagers, I, developed, a, fascination, with, the, opposite, sex.,  Eventually, this, fascination, led, to, meeting, a, nice, young, lady, who, then, became, my, girlfriend., She, was, smart,, fun, to, be, around,, pretty, and, most, importantly, willing, to, let, me, see, her, naked.,  Like, most, young, men, I, considered, these, to, be, wonderful, qualities, in, a, woman,, especially, that, last, one., Eventually, things, moved, in, the, direction, that, they, frequently, do, in, the, back, seat, of, an, ’88, Ford, Bronco, after, watching, Stop, or, My, Mom, Will, Shoot, at, the, dollar, theater, while, listening, to, Guns, and, Roses’, Get, in, the, Ring.,  I, have, always, been, a, hopeless, romantic.,  Also, to, my, mother,, father, and, two, sisters, I, TOLD, YOU, NOT, TO, READ, THIS!,  This, is, what, you, get, for, ignoring, me.,  I, can, actually, feel, Thanksgiving, getting, more, awkward, by, the, second., So, clearly, the, subject, of, protection, became, somewhat, urgent, to, me.,  When, we, started, dating, I, had, a, small, stash, of, applicable, devices, due, to, a, poorly, thought, out, attempt, by, my, mother, to, be, the, “cool, parent”.,  Because, if, there, is, one, thing, that, strengthens, the, maternal, bonds, its, a, box, of, lubricated, rubber, tubes, and, a, rather, unfortunate, cucumber., Note, to, parents:,  If, you, feel, compelled, to, be, the, “cool, parent”, choose, a, smaller, vegetable.,  Otherwise, you, are, setting, your, kids, up, for, some, serious, insecurity/disappointment, depending, on, their, gender, and/or, orientation., Of, course, we, eventually, ran, out, of, supplies, and, found, ourselves, in, need, of, more.,  Now, I, am, not, 100%, how, things, work, for, teenagers, now.,  I, imagine, picking, up, a, box, of, condoms, is, probably, not, all, that, big, of, a, deal, anymore.,  Heck, I, imagine, that, kids, these, days, are, picking, up, the, giant, Costco, sized, boxes, and, wearing, them, strapped, across, their, torso, like, an, ammo, belt, in, a, WWII, movie., But, when, I, was, a, kid, the, idea, of, buying, condoms, was, embarrassing.,  Because, you, were, basically, telling, everybody, in, the, store, what, you, were, planning, to, be, up, to, in, the, near, future.,  Or, worse, they, might, think, that, you, were, wasting, your, money, in, a, misguided, fit, of, optimism.,  Strangers, judging, you, is, a, serious, concern, at, that, age., Being, a, responsible, young, man,, I, set, out, to, restock, the, cache.,  Also,, my, girlfriend, was, too, embarrassed, to, do, it, for, me., And, thus, I, found, myself, going, to, the, condom, store.,  It, wasn’t, actually, a, store, for, condoms,, it, was, a, mom, and, pop, gas, station, with, a, well, stocked, convenience, store.,  They, pretty, much, had, everything, from, slurpees, to, oven, cleaner, to, charcoal, briquettes.,  Most, importantly, it, was, nowhere, near, my, house, or, school., And, so, I, girded, my, loins, for, battle, and, strode, in.,  And, by, strode, I, mean, nervously, skulked., Now, as, a, nervous, adolescent, boy, I, couldn’t, just, walk, up, to, the, condoms, and, grab, a, pack.,  That, would, make, me, look, like, some, sort, of, perverted, sex, freak.,  The, best, method,, I, determined,, was, to, sneak, up, on, them., I, started, perusing, the, oven, cleaner,, as, if, to, imply, “Hmmm,, I, do, need, some, oven, cleaner,, but, I’m, not, sure, if, this, is, the, brand, for, me.”,  I, then, casually, slid, closer, to, my, goal., “Oh, maybe, instead, of, oven, cleaner, I, need, some, canned, stew.”,  And, closer, still, “Perhaps, a, set, of, toe-nails, clippers, or, maybe, this, roll, of, Tums.”,  Finally, the, moment, of, truth.,  I, was, standing, in, front, of, a, display,, which, contained, more, options, than, I, had, anticipated.,  Panicking, I, just, grabbed, the, yellow, box.,  Red-faced,, I, approached, the, counter,, put, some, money, down,, and, vaguely, mumbled, something, about, the, weather., The, clerk, gave, me, a, small, smile, and, rang, up, my, purchase,, and, I, emerged, victorious., A, few, weeks, later, I, repeated, the, process,, but, this, time, my, girlfriend, came, with, me.,  I, went, in, and, stalked, my, prey,, while, my, girlfriend, pretended, to, be, deeply, interested, in, charcoal, briquettes., The, clerk,, who, was, in, fact, the, same, clerk, as, before, looked, at, the, both, of, us, and, looked, me, in, the, eye.,  He, gave, me, a, wink.,  Victorious, again., But, victory, had, an, unanticipated, side, affect.,  My, girlfriend, talked, to, her, friends.,  And, now, I, was, the, brave, guy, who, was, not, afraid, to, buy, condoms.,  I, had, basically, become, a, drug, dealer,, except, for, prophylactics., And, thus, the, day, after, purchasing, a, box, of, condoms, I, found, myself, back, in, the, store, with, my, girlfriend’s, best, buddy.,  I’m, pretty, sure, she, was, expressing, interest, in, a, 12, pack, of, Coke, while, I, went, about, my, task., I, received, a, very, considering, look, from, the, clerk, that, day., A, few, days, later,, yet, another, associate, of, my, girlfriend, wanted, help.,  Back, to, the, store,, she, was, brave, enough, to, sneak, up, on, the, condoms, with, me,, but, not, brave, enough, to, actually, handle, the, merchandise.,  There, was, a, look, of, incredulity, that, time., The, next, week, found, me,, my, girlfriend, and, yet, another, friend, of, hers, returning, to, the, store.,  This, new, friend, wasn’t, afraid, of, buying, the, product, in, question,, she, just, needed, a, ride.,  Also, she, was, a, bit, of, an, attention, whore.,  She, simply, marched, up,, grabbed, what, she, wanted, and, went, to, the, counter., “I, want, to, purchase, these, condoms!”,  The, clerk, looked, at, the, girls.,  And, then, at, me.,  And, then, at, the, girls, again.,  He, grinned, and, gave, me, a, thumbs, up, as, I, was, walking, out., The, next, week, I, went, in, with, my, friend, Dan.,  The, man, behind, the, counter, never, made, eye, contact, again.,  , Follow, Posted, in, Skippy's, Silly, Stories, |, 13, Comments, », Apollo, Con, May, 30th,, 2014, by, skippy, So, I, am, going, to, ApolloCon, 2014, in, Houston, next, month.,
