Technology, List, 7, Deadliest, Weapons, in, History, World, history, is, often, defined, by, wars., During, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries,, aircraft, came, to, play, increasingly, important, roles, in, determining, the, outcome, of, battles, as, well, as, being, deterrents, to, aggression., Military, aircraft, came, of, age, during, World, War, II,, and, their, utility, for, both, military, and, nonmilitary, purposes, expanded, during, the, Cold, War, era, and, beyond., A, list, of, some, of, these, great, planes, is, given, below., Hawker, Hurricane, (Great, Britain), The, Hurricane, was, a, British, single-seat, fighter, aircraft, manufactured, by, Hawker, Aircraft,, Ltd.,, in, the, 1930s, and, ’40s., The, Hurricane, was, numerically, the, most, important, British, fighter, during, the, critical, early, stages, of, World, War, II,, sharing, victory, laurels, with, the, Supermarine, Spitfire, in, the, Battle, of, Britain, (1940–41), and, the, defense, of, Malta, (1941–42)., Hurricanes, served, in, all, theaters, of, war, where, British, forces, were, engaged., The, Hurricane, emerged, from, efforts, by, Sydney, Camm,, Hawker’s, chief, designer,, to, develop, a, high-performance, monoplane, fighter, and, from, a, March, 1935, Air, Ministry, requirement, calling, for, an, unprecedented, heavy, armament, of, eight, wing-mounted, 0.303-inch, (7.7-mm), machine, guns., Designed, around, a, 1,200-horsepower,, 12-cylinder, in-line, Rolls-Royce, engine, soon, to, be, dubbed, the, Merlin,, the, Hurricane, was, an, evolutionary, development, of, earlier, Camm, designs,, notably, the, Fury, biplane, fighter., A, low-wing, monoplane, with, retractable, landing, gear,, the, Hurricane,, aside, from, its, clean, lines, and, heavy, armament,, was, a, conventional, design., Its, wings,, rear, fuselage,, and, tail, surfaces, were, covered, by, fabric,, though, the, fabric, wing, covering, soon, gave, way, to, aluminum., U-2, spy, plane, (United, States), U.S., Air, Force, The, U-2, is, a, single-seat, high-altitude, jet, aircraft, flown, by, the, United, States, for, intelligence, gathering,, surveillance,, and, reconnaissance., Perhaps, the, most, famous, spy, plane, ever, built,, the, U-2,, also, known, as, the, Dragon, Lady,, has, been, in, service, since, 1956., A, prototype, flew, in, 1955,, and, the, last, plane, in, the, series, was, built, in, 1989., On, May, 1,, 1960,, a, U-2, was, shot, down, over, the, Soviet, Union,, precipitating, the, U-2, Affair,, and, in, 1962,, during, the, Cuban, missile, crisis,, a, U-2, took, photographs, that, confirmed, the, presence, of, Soviet, nuclear-armed, missiles, in, Cuba., Strategic, intelligence-gathering, missions, have, continued,, but, the, U-2, also, has, been, used, for, battlefield, reconnaissance, and, surveillance, in, numerous, conflicts, and, tension, spots, where, the, United, States, has, been, engaged, since, the, Vietnam, War, in, the, 1960s., Although, many, of, its, functions, were, adopted, by, high-altitude, long-endurance, unmanned, aerial, vehicles,, several, U-2s, are, still, in, service., Since, the, 1980s, the, National, Aeronautics, and, Space, Administration, (NASA), has, operated, modified, U-2s,, designated, ER-2, (for, “Earth, resources”),, for, the, collection, of, data, on, the, atmosphere,, Earth,, and, celestial, phenomena., B-52, Stratofortress, (United, States), U.S., Air, Force/Department, of, Defense;, photo,, Bill, Thompson, The, B-52,, also, called, Stratofortress,, is, a, U.S., long-range, heavy, bomber, designed, by, the, Boeing, Company, in, 1948,, first, flown, in, 1952,, and, first, delivered, for, military, service, in, 1955., Though, originally, intended, to, be, an, atomic-bomb, carrier, capable, of, reaching, the, Soviet, Union,, it, has, proved, adaptable, to, a, number, of, missions,, and, some, B-52s, are, expected, to, remain, in, service, well, into, the, 21st, century., The, B-52, has, a, wingspan, of, 185, feet, (56, meters), and, a, length, of, 160, feet, 10.9, inches, (49, meters)., It, is, powered, by, eight, jet, engines, mounted, under, the, wings, in, four, twin, pods., The, plane’s, maximum, speed, at, 55,000, feet, (17,000, meters), is, Mach, 0.9, (595, miles, per, hour,, or, 960, km/hr);, at, only, a, few, hundred, feet, above, the, ground,, it, can, fly, at, Mach, 0.5, (375, miles, per, hour,, or, 600, km/hr)., It, originally, carried, a, crew, of, six,, its, sole, defensive, armament, being, a, remotely, controlled, gun, turret, in, the, tail., In, 1991, the, gun, was, eliminated, and, the, crew, reduced, to, five., The, huge, airframe, of, the, B-52, earned, it, the, nickname, “Big, Ugly, Fat, Fellow”, (BUFF),, but, it, also, allowed, the, plane, to, be, retrofitted, with, highly, sophisticated, navigational,, weapons-control,, and, electronic, countermeasures, systems., More, than, 70, B-52s, remain, in, service, in, the, United, States, Air, Force., F-16, Fighting, Falcon, (United, States), Ken, Hackman/U.S., Department, of, Defense, The, F-16,, also, called, Fighting, Falcon,, is, a, single-seat, single-engine, jet, fighter, built, by, the, General, Dynamics, Corporation, (now, part, of, the, Lockheed, Martin, Corporation), for, the, United, States, and, more, than, a, dozen, other, countries., The, F-16, originated, in, an, order, placed, in, 1972, for, a, lightweight, cost-effective, air-to-air, fighter;, current, models, are, also, all-weather, capable,, and, it, is, effective, for, ground, attack, as, well., The, U.S., Air, Force, took, first, delivery, in, 1978., The, F-16, is, 49, feet, (15, meters), long, and, has, a, wingspan, of, 31, feet, (9.45, meters)., It, is, powered, by, a, single, Pratt, &, Whitney, or, General, Electric, turbofan, engine,, which,, with, afterburning,, can, generate, 23,000, to, 29,000, pounds, (102, to, 130, kilonewtons), of, thrust,, accelerating, the, aircraft, to, more, than, twice, the, speed, of, sound., Weaponry, includes, an, 0.8-inch, (20-millimeter), rotary, cannon, as, well, as, attachments, under, the, wings, and, fuselage, for, a, wide, variety, of, bombs, and, missiles., With, a, typical, combat, load,, the, F-16, weighs, approximately, 23,000, pounds, (10,000, kg)., It, has, been, sold, to, U.S., allies, in, the, Middle, East,, where, it, proved, very, effective, in, air-to-air, combat, and, ground, attack, in, the, Israeli-Syrian, conflict, of, 1982, and, in, the, Persian, Gulf, War, of, 1990–91., In, terms, of, international, sales,, the, F-16, is, the, fighter, in, greatest, demand,, and, it, is, currently, in, the, air, forces, of, more, than, 20, countries., MiG-21, fighter, (Soviet, Union), The, Russian, aerospace, design, bureau’s, MiG-21,, a, lightweight, single-engine, interceptor, capable, of, flying, at, twice, the, speed, of, sound,, was, introduced, in, 1955., The, basic, version,, which, entered, service, in, 1958,, was, a, simple, low-cost, day, fighter, that, was, highly, maneuverable,, easy, to, maintain,, and, able, to, operate, from, unimproved, airfields., The, design, bureau, produced, more, than, 9,000, MiG-21s, in, as, many, as, 32, versions, for, the, air, forces, of, the, Soviet, Union, and, more, than, 40, other, countries, and, licensed, a, version, for, production, in, China., It, became, the, principal, high-altitude, interceptor, used, by, North, Vietnam,, and, improved, versions, formed, the, backbone, of, Arab, air, forces, through, the, 1970s., Tupolev, Tu-95, bomber, (Soviet, Union/Russia), After, adapting, jet, propulsion, to, several, piston-engine, airframes,, Tupolev, in, 1952, introduced, the, Tu-16, (“Badger”),, a, medium-range, bomber, that, featured, swept, wings, and, light, alloy, construction., A, team, under, Aleksandr, A., Arkhangelsky,, longtime, associate, of, company, cofounder, Andrey, Tupolev,, designed, the, Tu-95, (“Bear”),, a, huge, turboprop, bomber, that, first, flew, in, 1954, and, became, one, of, the, most, durable, military, aircraft, ever, built, and, one, of, the, longest-lived, aircraft, in, the, Soviet, strategic, arsenal. Russia, still, operates, more, than, 50, Tu-95, aircraft, as, cruise-missile, carriers., Bf, 109, fighter, (Germany), The, Bayerische, Flugzeugwerke, 109,, also, called, Me, 109,, was, Nazi, Germany’s, most, important, fighter, aircraft,, both, in, operational, importance, and, in, numbers, produced., It, was, commonly, referred, to, as, the, Me, 109, after, its, designer,, Willy, Messerschmitt., The, Jumo-powered, Bf, 109B,, armed, with, four, 0.3-inch, (7.92-mm), machine, guns,, entered, service, in, 1937, and, was, immediately, tested, in, combat, in, the, Spanish, Civil, War., There, it, fought, with, success, against, Soviet, I-16, monoplanes, and, I-15, biplane, fighters,, in, part, because, of, the, Luftwaffe’s, pioneering, use, of, interplane, radio, to, control, formations, in, air-to-air, combat., During, that, period,, fuel-injected, Daimler-Benz, DB601, engines, in, the, 1,000-horsepower, range, had, become, available,, resulting, in, the, Bf, 109E,, which, was, armed, with, two, wing-mounted, 0.8-inch, (20-mm), automatic, cannons, and, two, machine, guns, in, the, engine, cowling., (An, additional, cannon, was, to, fire, through, the, propeller, hub,, but, this, was, not, immediately, successful.), The, Bf, 109E,, the, principal, German, fighter, from, the, invasion, of, Poland, in, 1939, through, the, Battle, of, Britain, (1940–41),, had, a, top, speed, of, 350, miles, (570, km), per, hour, and, a, ceiling, of, 36,000, feet, (11,000, meters)., It, was, superior, to, anything, the, Allies, could, muster, at, low, and, medium, altitudes,, but, it, was, outperformed, by, the, British, Spitfire, at, altitudes, above, 15,000, feet, (4,600, meters)., P-51, Mustang, (United, States), Ben, Bloker/U.S., Air, Force, The, P-51,, also, called, Mustang,, is, a, single-seat, single-engine, fighter, aircraft, originally, designed, and, produced, by, North, American, Aviation, for, the, British, Royal, Air, Force, (RAF), and, later, adopted, by, the, U.S., Army, Air, Forces, (USAAF)., The, P-51, is, widely, regarded, as, the, finest, all-around, piston-engined, fighter, of, World, War, II, to, have, been, produced, in, significant, numbers., Approximately, 1,500, Merlin-powered, Mustangs, were, used, by, the, RAF, for, daylight, duties, over, Europe,, and, the, plane, was, produced, under, license, in, Australia, toward, the, end, of, the, war., A, few, were, delivered, to, Nationalist, China., The, most, widely, produced, version, was, the, P-51D., Fitted, with, a, Plexiglas, “bubble”, canopy, for, all-around, vision,, it, flew, to, a, maximum, speed, of, about, 440, miles, (700, km), per, hour,, reached, an, operating, ceiling, of, almost, 42,000, feet, (12,800, meters),, and, was, armed, with, six, wing-mounted, 0.5-inch, (12.7-mm), machine, guns., Dassault-Breguet, Mirage, (France), Curt, Eddings/Department, of, Defense, Mirage, is, the, name, for, any, member, of, a, family, of, combat, aircraft, produced, by, the, Dassault-Breguet, aeronautics, firm, of, France., These, relatively, inexpensive, simple,, durable, aircraft, were, adopted, by, many, of, the, world’s, smaller, air, forces, from, the, 1960s., The, first, Mirage, aircraft, was, the, single-engine, delta-wing, Mirage, III., This, craft, was, first, flown, in, 1956, but, subsequently, underwent, significant, development., One, variant, of, it, became, a, basic, interceptor,, another, a, fighter-bomber,, and, a, third, a, reconnaissance, aircraft., During, the, 1960s, the, Mirage, III, was, the, basic, air, superiority, fighter, of, the, Israeli, air, force,, and, it, performed, spectacularly, in, the, Six-Day, War, of, 1967., Other, countries, whose, air, forces, adopted, the, Mirage, III, included, Brazil,, Lebanon,, South, Africa,, Argentina,, Pakistan,, Spain,, Australia,, and, Switzerland., Mitsubishi, Zero, (Empire, of, Japan), Paul, Richter, The, Zero,, also, called, Mitsubishi, A6M, or, Navy, Type, 0,, is, a, single-seat, low-wing, monoplane, used, with, great, effect, by, the, Japanese, during, World, War, II., It, was, designed, by, Horikoshi, Jiro, and, was, the, first, carrier-based, fighter, capable, of, besting, its, land-based, opponents., It, was, designed, to, specifications, written, in, 1937,, was, first, tested, in, 1939,, and, was, placed, in, production, and, in, operation, in, China, in, 1940., Although, Allied, forces, code-named, the, aircraft, “Zeke,”, it, was, generally, known, as, the, Zero,, a, term, derived, from, one, of, its, Japanese, names—Reisen, Kanjikisen, (Type, Zero, Carrier-Based, Fighter, Airplane),, abbreviated, Reisen., The, year, its, production, began,, 1940,, was, the, 2,600th, anniversary, of, the, ascension, to, the, throne, of, Japan’s, legendary, first, emperor,, Jimmu,, hence, the, “zero”, designation., A-10, Thunderbolt, II, (United, States), Parker, Gyokeres/U.S., Air, Force, photo, The, Fairchild, Republic, A-10A, Thunderbolt, II,, a, two-seat, twin-engine, aircraft, first, flown, in, 1972,, became, in, the, mid-1970s, the, principal, close-support, attack, aircraft, of, the, U.S., Air, Force., Its, primary, armament, is, a, nose-mounted, seven-barreled, 1.2-inch, (30-millimeter), cannon, that, is, an, extremely, effective, “tank, killer.”, The, aircraft, has, seen, service, in, the, Persian, Gulf, War,, the, Iraq, War,, and, the, Afghanistan, War,, as, well, as, the, war, against, ISIL., Previous, List, 5, of, the, World's, Most-Devastating, Financial, Crises, Next, List, 7, Deadliest, Shipwrecks, More, History, Lists, View,
