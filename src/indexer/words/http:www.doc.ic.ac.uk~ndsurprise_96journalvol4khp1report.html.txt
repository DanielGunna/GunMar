[The, Parents, the, Kids, and, THE, INTERACTIVE, TV!!!!, by, KEVAL, PINDORIA, and, G, C, WONG, PING, HUNG, Contents, Introduction, What, can, Interactive, Television, be, used, for?, Distance, Learning, Video, On, Demand, Game, Shows, Home, Shopping, Electronic, Programming, Guides, Information, Retrieval, (Internet), Voting, Telebanking, What, equipment, will, you, need?, Set, Top, Box, Remote, Control, Television, TV, or, PC?, What, should, you, know, before, installing, Interactive, Television?, How, will, Interactive, Television, affect, the, family?, What, lies, ahead, for, Interactive, Television?, Conclusion, Bibliography, Appendix, -, References, Appendix, -, Trials, British, Telecom, Appendix, -, Glossary, of, IATV, Terms, Introduction, Have, you, ever, sat, down, with, your, family, hoping, that, there, was, a, good, film, that, you, could, watch?, Have, you, ever, felt, like, participating, along, with, a, game, show, that, you, are, watching?, Have, you, felt, like, checking, your, share, prices, or, even, ordering, a, pizza?, Have, you, wanted, to, shop, around, in, the, comfort, of, your, own, home, in, front, of, the, television?, Have, you, ever, felt, that, there, were, not, enough, channels?, Well,, if, you, have, then, you, would, be, interested, in, INTERACTIVE, TELEVISION., Interactive, Television, (IATV), will, change, the, way, we, watch, television, by, allowing, you, to, interact, with, it, more., There, are, many, more, services, available, -, IATV, can, act, as, an, education, medium, and, information, provider., All, these, services, are, available, in, the, comfort, of, your, own, living, room,, and, can, be, as, easy, as, pressing, a, button., If, your, family, wants, to, install, IATV, into, your, house,, there, are, certain, questions, which, your, family, should, ask, themselves., What, knowledge, should, you, and, your, family, possess, about, IATV,, and, what, sort, of, social/legal, issues, will, you, be, facing?, Before, installing, IATV,, it, is, important, that, these, questions, are, answered., What, can, Interactive, Television, be, used, for?, There, are, many, applications, that, Interactive, Television, can, be, used, for, including, Distance, Learning,, Video, On, Demand,, Game, Shows,, Home, Shopping,, Electronic, Programming, Guides,, Information, Retrieval, (Internet),, Voting,, and, Telebanking,, all, of, which, can, be, done, very, easily, using, a, Remote, Control,, aimed, at, the, TV, with, a, Set, Top, Box, on, top, of, it., Distance, Learning, Interactive, Television, makes, it, possible, for, the, whole, family, to, educate, themselves, on, all, sorts, of, topics,, in, their, own, living, room,, at, their, own, pace, and, in, private., Children, can, learn, to, read,, see, what, Saturn, looks, like,, and, they, will, be, able, to, take, their, GCSEs,, A-Levels,and, even, degrees., You, can, find, out, what, the, government, is, upto,, take, a, course, in, DIY,, take, your, A-levels,, learn, how, to, change, the, oil, in, your, car, and, much, more!!., Distance, Learning, is, learning, where, you,, the, student, and, the, teacher, do, not, physically, have, to, be, in, the, same, location., You, can, experience, presentations, from, teachers, and, specialists, in, selected, fields, of, study, from, other, parts, of, the, world., Also,, if, you, face, problems, which, you, cannot, solve,, you, can, post, them, to, institutions, all, over, the, world, and, ask, for, help., [1], [2], You, will, be, able, to, see, all, the, other, students, and, the, teacher, at, any, moment, in, time, in, live, transmissions, but, you, can, learn, when, you, want, to, and, at, your, own, pace, if, you, prefer., Figure, 1, A, main, concern, for, parents, regarding, Distance, Learning, is, the, possible, failure, to, develop, reading, skills., In, subjects, such, as, literature,, students, may, find, it, easier, to, watch, a, Shakespere, play, on, television, than, actually, read, it., Watching, is, much, easier, than, reading,, because, a, picture, conveys, a, thousand, words., The, use, of, images, and, sound, (multimedia), makes, it, easier, for, people, to, learn, and, is, also, enjoyable., The, rapidly, increasing, multimedia, PC, market, is, proof, of, this., More, people, are, buying, PCs, for, their, social, uses, and, to, help, educate, their, children., [3], [4], Several, experts, think, that, Distance, Learning, will, be, available, on, mass, scale, within, the, next, 10, years., Below, is, a, quote, from, Bates, A.W, :, (1993), Educational, aspects, of, the, telecommunications, revolution, in, Teleteaching, North, Holland, :, IFIP, [5]:, "The, implications, for, education, and, training, are, immense;, learning, can, be, independent, of, time, and, place,, and, available, at, all, stages, of, a, person's, life., The, learning, context, will, be, technologically, rich., Learners, will, have, access, not, only, to, a, wide, range, of, media,, but, also, to, a, wide, range, of, sources, of, education", Video, On, Demand, You, can, watch, any, movie, at, any, time, convenient, to, you., For, example,, if, you, missed, the, regular, free, network, broadcast, of, Seinfeld, last, Thursday, night,, you, could, ask, to, see, it, again, at, any, time, for, a, small, charge., The, same, applies, to, any, movie,, talk, show,, news, reports,, etc., [6], [7], You, can, request, a, video, and, have, it, sent, specifically, to, you,, with, VCR-like, capabilities, to, pause,, stop,, rewind, and, fast-forward, at, any, time., There, are, also, plans, to, sell, viewers, "video, storage, space,", so, that, they, can, save, their, home, movies, on, a, central, video, server, and, play, them, at, leisure., At, present,, many, of, the, companies, experimenting, with, video-on-demand, are, using, a, system, that, is, similar, to, ordering, pay-per-view, movies, by, telephone, and, receiving, them, on, a, special, cable, channel., In, a, TCI, test,, Denver, residents, were, able, to, choose, a, movie, from, an, onscreen, list, of, hundreds., The, choice, was, made, with, a, remote,, and, the, movie, played, within, minutes., The, drawback, to, the, system, was, that, when, a, selection, was, made,, a, clerk, in, a, TCI, warehouse, had, to, physically, retrieve, the, movie, and, play, it, in, a, standard, VCR., When, cable, services, switch, to, digital, transmission,, and, are, able, to, use, enhanced, data, compression, methods,, video-on-demand, systems, are, expected, to, improve, greatly., [8], In, addition, you, can, choose, from, about, 500, channels, including, channels, such, as, a, Movie, Channel,, a, Children's, Channel,, a, Sports, Channel,, a, Shopping, Channel,, a, cooking, channel, etc., (known, as, speciality, channels), which, show, the, same, programs, to, all, the, viewers., Game, Shows, You, can, play, games, where, you, are, a, participant, and, not, a, watcher., The, TV, host, asks, you, a, question, and, you, could, answer, using, a, keyboard, that, is, connected, to, your, Interactive, Television, system., Games, can, run, simultaneously, with, live, football, games,, and, the, object, is, to, predict, "what, is, going, to, happen, next"., Players, compete, to, be, the, top, scorer,, and, send, their, scores, in, for, a, national, ranking., In, addition, to, sports, games,, game, shows, are, a, popular, venue, for, IATV., You, can, play, along, with, The, Wheel, of, Fortune, or, any, other, game, show, that, you, want., You, can, even, win, prizes, by, getting, a, certain, number, of, points., [8], Home, Shopping, You, could, order, articles, -, ranging, from, supermarket, items, to, clothes, and, have, them, in, your, hands, the, following, day,, ordering, it, by, pushing, a, single, button, on, your, remote, control,, while, sitting, in, your, chair, watching, TV., Consumers, are, increasingly, choosing, to, shop, from, their, homes., Many, feel, safer, shopping, from, home, rather, than, in, malls/shopping, centres., Most, consumers, feel, that, the, sales, representatives, simply, are, not, knowledgeable, about, the, products, that, they, sell., With, IATV,, you, will, be, able, to, choose, from, catalogues, which, have, pictures, and, also, descriptions., Some, interactive, channels, in, the, US, are, now, offering, grocery, services, that, deliver, the, groceries, to, the, consumers, front, door., [9], A, problem, that, you, may, face, with, Home, Shopping, is, that, if, say,, you, buy, a, jumper, by, pressing, the, "buy", button, on, your, remote, and, receive, it, the, following, day, and, you, find, out, it, is, too, small,, then, you, would, have, to, send, it, back, at, your, own, expense., The, two, most, popular, ways, of, paying, for, item(s), is, by, credit-card, or, ecash, (electronic, cash)., If, you, paid, by, ecash,, the, money, (ecash), would, be, taken, out, of, your, account, like, a, direct, debit., Electronic, Programming, Guides, With, the, increasing, number, of, channels, being, offered,, it, would, be, convenient, to, select, one, from, a, list., "Channel-surfing", (or, flipping, through), that, many, channels, would, take, quite, a, while, if, you, stopped, at, each, channel,, Electronic, Programming, Guides, will, allow, quick, and, easy, scanning, of, current, or, future, programming, by, subject, (say, sports, or, soap, operas),, time, period, or, even, by, desired, actor, or, actress., [10], Information, Retrieval, (Internet), You, could, get, information, on, everything, you, want, using, Interactive, Television., You, could, get, phone, numbers,, travel, guides,, airline, schedules,, product, information, and, even, coupons, for, supermarkets, by, using, a, printer, linked, to, the, Interacxtive, Television, System., Another, possibility, is, to, browse, the, internet., You, can, receive, local, and, international, news,, traffic, reports,, weather,, sports, scores, and, stock, quotes, every, morning, displayed, on, your, TV, or, printed, on, an, optional, letter-size, printer., And, instead, of, just, providing, the, same, old, "general-purpose", news,, Personalized, News, is, tailored, to, you,, providing, news, on, the, topics, of, your, choice., Further,, the, service, allows, quick, tracking, of, stocks, and, sports, teams, that, are, of, interest, to, you,, by, providing, customized, details, on, stocks, and, teams, that, you, choose., [10], Voting, You, can, participate, in, local,, regional, or, even, national, polls, simply, by, pressing, a, button, on, the, remote, control., The, results, are, quickly, tabulated, and, shown, on, the, screen., You, will, be, given, an, individual, password, but, problems, can, occur, if, the, password, is, lost, or, is, known, to, others., After, you, have, voted,, and, acknowledgement, is, sent, to, you, confirming, that, your, vote, has, been, received., There, is, not, much, chance, for, anyone, to, see, your, vote, or, change, it, because, it, is, encrypted, but, there, is, still, a, chance, that, someone, may, hack, into, the, system!!., Telebanking, Until, now,, payments, were, made, using, traditional, payment, mechanisms, like, regular, bank-accounts,, credit, cards, details, etc., Now, you, can, open, a, special, electronic, cash, (ecash), account, to, pay, for, services., In, this, system,, monthly, fees, for, a, service, can, be, transfered, from, your, bank-account, into, the, account, of, whom, you, want, to, pay., You, can, use, this, account, to, pay, for, items, that, you, have, purchased, from, home, shopping., Another, way, is, to, pay, by, credit-card., If, you, want, to, use, a, service,, you, simply, send, your, credit-card, details, to, the, service, provider, involved, and, the, credit-card, organisation, will, handle, the, payment., Again, encrypting,, scrambling, or, coding, of, confidential, information, must, be, used., [11], What, equipment, will, you, need?, You, now, know, what, Interactive, Television, can, be, used, for,, but, you, cannot, receive, it, unless, you, have, some, specific, equipment., The, main, pieces, of, equipment, that, you, need, are, the, Set, Top, box,, the, Remote, Control,, and, the, Television., You, also, need, to, be, connected, to, a, network, operator, providing, the, services, that, you, require., Set, Top, Box, This, decodes, the, signals, as, they, arrive, from, the, main, control, centre., An, important, point, here, is, the, price., Prices, will, start, from, about, $300, [10], for, a, typical, Interactive, Television, Set, Top, Box, but, can, increase, significantly, if, you, want, additional, facilities, like, Distance, Learning, -, where, you, would, need, a, video, camera, and, a, keyboard, so, that, live, transmissions, can, take, place., Set, Top, Boxes, with, full, MPEG, [12], decompression, capabilities, is, initially, expensive, but, there, are, facilities, where, you, can, rent, such, systems., Some, companies, even, supply, free, Set, Top, Boxes, provided, that, you, subscribe, to, the, channels!!, [13], Remote, Control, Users, need, a, friendly, interface, to, find, their, way, through, all, the, services, available, to, them, and, to, communicate, with, the, main, control, system., This, can, be, done, by, a, menu, system, (on-screen, graphics)., This, allows, you, to, select, a, service, and, then, specify, what, particular, aspect, of, that, service, you, require., Television, In, order, to, get, the, Interactive, Television, System, at, home,, you, can, either, use, your, existing, television, or, buy, a, new, one., You, could, buy, a, new, HDTV, which, has, a, benefit, of, providing, a, higher, resolution, picture, so, that, you, have, a, clearer, picture, aswell, as, CD-quality, sound., [14], [15], The, above, equipment, is, just, the, basic, equipment, that, you, need, to, get, services, like, Home, Shopping,, Electronic, Programming, Guides,, and, Information, Retrieval., For, services, such, as, Printing, out, coupons, you, would, need, a, printer, in, addition, to, the, Set, Top, Box,, TV, and, Remote, Control., TV, or, PC?, By, now, you, should, realise, that, IATV, is, similar, to, PCs, in, certain, aspects, -, both, offer, interactive, services., So,, which, should, you, choose?, IATV, or, PC?, In, interactive, television, you, have, home, shopping,, distance, learning, and, internet, access., Personal, computers, have, on-line, shopping, and, internet, access, too., Distance, learning, can, be, implemented, into, PCs, because, they, can, display, broadcasted, programmes,, just, like, a, television., It, is, uncertain, if, PCs, can, offer, hundreds, of, entertainment, channels, like, IATV,, but, PCs, have, processors, which, are, more, advanced, than, those, in, IATV, settop, boxes,, allowing, it, to, create, and, run, programmes, such, as, word, processors,, databases,, spreadsheets, and, other, application, programmes., IATV, does, not, have, such, a, feature, yet., It, is,, however,, cheaper, than, the, PC., So, the, choice, of, a, PC, or, TV, is, dependent, upon, what, applications(features?), your, family, requires., [16][17], What, should, you, know, before, installing, Interactive, Television?, Legal, Issues, It, is, difficult, for, governments, to, carry, out, censorship, on, interactive, television, items., Governments, face, pressure, from, human, rights, groups, who, believe, that, government, intervention, in, censorship, results, in, the, inhibition, of, human, rights, to, free, speech, and, democracy., Also,, different, countries, have, different, views, on, censorship., Being, a, world, wide, resource,, the, internet, allows, your, family, to, access, sites, from, other, countries, which, may, have, less, strict, censorship, laws, than, your, own, country., Therefore,, you, should, not, expect, the, governemnt, to, censor, any, material, you, dislike., [18], [19], Copyright, When, surfing, the, World, Wide, Web, with, Interactive, TV,, it, is, common, that, you, may, need, to, copy, parts, from, certain, articles, or, save, some, pictures., There, are, certain, copyright, laws, which, you, would, have, to, take, note, of., An, item, is, copyrighted, as, soon, as, it, is, written., There, does, not, have, to, be, a, notice, claiming, that, it, is, copyrighted., You, are, allowed, to, use, an, excerpt, of, an, article,, and, it, must, be, attributed., You, must, not, use, the, article, in, a, way, that, will, harm, its, commercial, value., You, may, argue, that, you, are, giving, the, article, free, publicity,, but, that, is, dependent, on, whether, the, owner, wants, such, publicity., Copyright, of, an, item, is, never, lost, unless, it, is, explicitly, given, away., Trademarks, cannot, be, used, if, it, unfairly, hurts, the, value, of, the, trademark,, or, if, someone, can, confuse, you, with, the, owner, of, it., [20], How, will, Interactive, Television, affect, the, family?, Impacts, on, Children, IATV, can, have, some, serious, impacts, on, your, children., There, has, been, much, debate, about, the, amount, of, violence, and, adult, material, on, television., IATV,, with, its, internet, connections, and, many, specialty, channels,, can, present, more, of, this, material, to, our, children., Specialty, adult, channels, can, show, adult, programmes, up, to, 24, hours, a, day., If, children, get, access, to, these,, it, can, have, an, adverse, effect, on, them., Through, the, internet,, children, can, see, and, read, such, material, easily., How, can, you, prevent, your, children, from, laying, their, eyes, on, these, items?, We, have, seen, how, censorship, is, difficult, to, achieve, in, IATV., You, can, teach, children, about, what, is, wrong, to, see, and, what, is, not., Alternatively,, there, is, a, device, under, development, which, will, filter, out, material, unsuitable, for, children, from, IATV, programmes., [21], [22], Impacts, on, communication, Interactive, television, is, going, to, make, available, the, communication, services, provided, by, the, internet., One, such, service, is, electronic, mail., It, can, be, sent, anywhere, within, a, short, period, of, time., Contacts, between, friends, and, relatives, can, be, kept, easily., [23], [24], The, Internet, Relay, Chat, (IRC), acts, like, a, hotline, where, your, family, can, join, and, talk, to, other, people, with, common, interests., You, can, talk, about, various, topics, ranging, from, religion, to, tips, on, winning, video, games., There, are, also, discussion, groups, where, sensitive, issues, such, as, abortion, and, political, problems, can, be, brought, up., Family, members, who, cannot, talk, to, their, families, directly, can, get, advice, from, the, discussion, groups., [1], One, should, be, aware, of, the, friends, that, they, make, on, IRC, or, the, discussion, groups., It, is, easy, to, fake, one's, identity, on, the, internet., People, take, on, a, different, identity, to, make, themselves, more, popular,, or, to, satisfy, some, feelings, which, they, cannot, recieve, in, the, real, world., Of, course,, there, are, some, who, take, on, a, different, identity, for, fun,, with, no, intention, of, doing, harm., Butt, there, are, poeple, who, change, their, identity, to, cause, harm, to, others., We, should, therefore, not, take, IRC, too, seriously., [25], [22], There, are, dangers, associated, with, the, communication, services, mentioned, above., Some, discussion, groups, may, discuss, about, adult, material, which, is, not, suitable, for, children., Some, may, be, spreading, race, hate, propaganda., Newsgroups, exist, for, people, to, post, and, obtain, information, on, certain, topics., Some, internet, users, set, up, newsgroups, for, the, sake, of, stirring, up, anti-racial, feelings,, or, to, post, articles, with, adult, material., These, newsgroups, can, be, accessed, easily,, and, could, affect, your, family., Again,, there, is, little, the, government, can, do, about, censorship., It, is, up, to, proper, guidance, to, minimise, the, effects, of, these, material., [22], The, internet, presents, certain, bad, elements, in, society, an, alternative, to, to, carry, out, their, wicked, trade., Web-stalkers, can, follow, a, person, through, the, internet., They, can, defame, a, person, by, posting, false, stories, on, the, newsgroups,, or, sending, offensive, email, to, the, victim., As, said, earlier, it, is, easy, to, hide, one's, identity, on, the, internet., Children, can, also, face, harm., Adult, material, can, be, sent, easily, through, email., Some, adults, may, even, pose, as, children,, befriending, other, children, on, the, internet,, and, then, asking, them, out., [22], [26], The, erosion, of, privacy, There, is, a, fear, that, interactive, television, could, lead, to, a, loss, of, privacy., In, home, shopping,, the, company, providing, the, service, has, to, record, your, credit, card, details, to, make, a, transaction., These, details, can, include, information, about, your, family, and, your, buying, habits., With, this, information,, the, company, will, know, your, income,, your, preferences, and, can, start, sending, you, advertisements, through, emails, and, pamphlets, regarding, products, which, you, may, or, may, not, need., Even, governments, try, to, obtain, such, data, to, check, for, possible, cases, of, espionage,, or, just, to, do, a, survey, on, habits, of, the, citizens., [27], There, are, other, people, who, may, be, interested, in, information,, such, as, your, television, viewing, hours,, when, your, television, is, switched, off, etc., Hackers, can, find, out, about, your, family, as, well, as, your, viewing, habits, and, other, personal, details., Even, your, email, can, be, intercepted., Intimate, matters, and, secrets, can, be, made, known, to, strangers., With, such, information,, people, can, harrass, you, on, the, internet,, and, criminals, can, harm, you, and, your, property., [26], To, prevent, the, evasion, of, privacy,, encryption, is, used, to, protect, data., Email, is, encrypted, before, sending,, and, data, regarding, your, family, is, encrypted, as, well., Only, people, who, legally, have, a, right, to, view, these, material, can, have, the, knowledge, of, decryption., However,, smart, hackers, can, also, have, the, abilty, to, decrypt, your, data., And, decryption, does, not, prevent, Home, Shopping, companies, from, obtaining, information, about, you., [26], What, lies, ahead, for, Interactive, Television?, Our, Thoughts, of, The, Future, What, is, the, future, for, interactive, television?, With, the, advent, of, newer, technologies,, our, programmes, and, applications, can, become, more, interactive., The, television, may, not, be, what, it, used, to, be., Instead, of, a, flat, screen, version,, we, may, have, a, 3-d, television,, where, you, can, view, a, programme, at, any, angle, you, like,, at, a, size, you, prefer., IATV, would, mean, more, than, just, being, able, to, see, and, hear., Through, sensory, equipment,, we, may, be, able, to, touch,, smell, and, even, taste, through, IATV., Virtual, reality, can, play, a, vital, role, in, the, future, of, IATV., We, can, participate, in, virtual, reality, games, in, our, homes., We, can, "go", to, places,, not, just, read, about, them., In, education,, we, can, participate, in, active, learning, through, virtual, worlds., We, can, take, part, in, historic, battles,, or, find, out, how, a, blood, cell, travels, in, the, human, body., There, is, great, potential, for, the, development, of, IATV., We, are, not, certain, what, the, future, holds, for, IATV,, but, some, are, certain, that, IATV, will, not, merge, with, PCs., One, of, these, is, Bill, Gates,, who, felt, that, PCs, and, TVs, will, not, merge, because, of, their, different, uses, and, technology, :, "....the, form, and, function, of, communications, appliances, such, as, TVs,, computers, and, telephones, will, tend, to, remain, distinct-because, we, use, the, tools, in, different, ways.", [17], His, views, are, shared, by, Jerry, McCarthy,, president, of, Zenith, Sales, Company:, "Television, sets, and, computers, will, never, become, one, unit., Sure,, there, will, be, more, interactivity, in, television, sets......, But, we, look, at, interactivity, that, complements, TV, viewing, rather, than, supplants, it.", [16], Conclusion, IATV, is, going, to, change, the, way, we, watch, television., We, have, seen, the, services, which, are, offered, by, IATV., These, services, are, interactive,, allowing, the, viewer, to, communicate,, not, only, by, receiving, signals,, but, by, the, ability, to, send, signals, as, well., This, two, way, communication, allows, us, to, have, services, like, video, on, demand,, Distance, Learning, and, Home, Shopping., Internet, access, makes, it, possible, for, us, to, send, emails,, join, in, discussion, groups, on, the, internet,, and, to, search, for, information., Knowledge, of, the, equipment, required, for, IATV, is, necessary, for, the, family., They, should, understand, which, components, they, would, require, for, a, particular, type, of, application., Distance, learning,, for, example, would, require, more, equipment, than, Video, on, demand., Knowledge, of, legal, issues, is, also, important, if, you, do, not, want, to, be, sued., The, divisions, between, IATV, and, PCs, were, briefly, discussed., We, feel, that, the, main, difference, between, these, two, technologies, lies, in, the, type, of, uses., It, seems, that, IATV, is, more, for, entertainment,, whereas, PCs, can, be, used, for, running, programs., What, you, choose, reflects, what, applications, you, want., A, major, topic, presented, here, is, that, of, impacts, of, IATV, on, the, family., Currently,, the, average, person, spends, about, 20, hours, a, week, watching, television, [28]., Through, IATV,, we, can, do, many, things, in, our, own, homes,, such, as, Home, Shopping, and, Distance, learning., This,, together, with, the, availability, of, more, TV, channels, and, Video, on, Demand,, is, going, to, make, the, number, of, hours, we, spend, in, front, of, the, television, much, longer., We, believe, this, could, lead, to, families, exercising, less,, and, spending, most, of, their, time, watching, television., This, can, affect, the, health, of, your, family, members., If, families, spend, too, much, time, in, front, of, televisions,, families, may, isolate, themselves, from, the, rest, of, the, community., This, could, lead, to, the, breakdown, of, society, -, where, neighbours, do, not, know, one, another,, and, seldom, see, one, another., Even, within, the, families,, erosion, of, family, bonding, can, take, place., If, each, member, of, the, family, has, access, to, his, or, her, own, IATV,, they, may, spend, more, time, on, these, machines, instead, of, interacting, with, one, another., The, power, of, communication, through, IATV, cannot, be, underestimated., It, is, possible, that, IRC,, Discussion, groups, and, email, can, present, new, dangers, to, us, and, our, children,, as, seen, above., These, dangers, include, web, stalking,, harassement,, defamation, and, spread, of, offensive, material., However,, we, strongly, feel, that, communication, through, IATV, can, help, us, reach, other, people, around, the, world., This, is, particularly, useful, for, people, who, are, handicapped., Through, IATV,, these, people, can, interact, with, other, people, without, leaving, their, beds., They, can, make, friends,, find, out, information, which, they, require,, at, the, click, of, a, button., They, can, buy, their, groceries, through, Home, shopping., In, the, past,, these, people, were, isolated, from, the, world,, unable, to, make, any, contact, except, through, the, window, or, the, occasional, walk, out, of, their, beds., Through, IATV,, they, can, be, part, of, the, community, again., Earlier,, we, mentioned, that, through, IATV,, families, may, spend, more, time, in, front, of, the, TV, set, and, less, time, outside, their, houses., Some, may, say, that, this, could, lead, to, a, breakdown, of, society,, where, families, isolate, themselves, from, the, rest, of, the, community., We, feel, that, this, is, not, the, case., Through, IATV,, we, can, still, maintain, contacts, with, our, friends, and, neighbours., The, use, of, email, and, irc, makes, this, possible., Electronic, community, meetings, can, help, to, maintain, relationships, between, community, members., Another, topic, discussed, here, concerns, the, type, of, material, on, IATV., One, should, be, aware, of, the, powers, of, the, government, concerning, censorship., Since, there, is, little, the, government, can, do,, it, is, up, to, parents, to, teach, children., So, what, does, the, future, hold, for, IATV., As, mentioned, above,, we, are, not, certain, of, the, actual, developments, that, might, take, place., But, we, believe, that, it, will, head, in, the, direction, of, developing, more, interactive, forms, of, television, viewing., Features, like, VOD, and, Distance, learning, will, still, be, present,, except, with, greater, interactivity., The, impacts, on, IATV, on, your, family, is, going, to, be, great., As, IATV, develops,, and, becomes, more, well, defined,, you, can, expect, more, families, to, install, interactive, television, into, their, homes., Your, family, should, be, aware, of, the, uses,, equipment,, legal, issues, and, how, IATV, will, affect, you., If, you, have, such, knowlege,, your, family, can, harness, the, power, of, IATV, to, serve, them, well., It, will, provide, a, new, world, of, communication, and, entertainment, for, your, family., [29], Bibliography, [1], Social, Aspects, of, the, Web, http://www.cs.unc.edu/wwwc/public/dilip/socialAspects.htm, [2], Distance, Learning,

services, provided, by, British, Telecom., British, Telecom, -, BT, Interactive, TV, [30], BT, started, recruiting, customers, for, Interactive, TV,, its, world-leading, market, trial, of, interactive, multimedia, services., The, trial,, started, last, summer, (1995),, will, involves, about, 2,500, customers, in, Colchester, and, Ipswich., All, customers, were, recruited, by, market, research, to, allow, BT, to, achieve, a, representative, demographic, sample, of, the, UK, population,, and, a, wide, range, of, data, was, collected, about, them, before, service, was, connected., BT, Interactive, TV, consists, of, nine, main, services:, movies, on, demand;, television, programming, on, demand;, children's, TV;, education;, music, videos;, local, life;, and, High, Street,, which, incorporates, home, shopping, and, home, banking., In, addition, there, are, two, services,, games, on, demand, and, Adland, (an, interactive, advertising, service)., The, services, are, ordered, and, controlled, via, a, standard, remote, control,, and, delivered, to, a, normal, television, over, copper, telephone, lines, for, the, majority, of, homes, and, over, fibre, to, the, remainder., The, aim, of, the, BT, Interactive, TV, trial, was, to, find, out, what, customers, want, and, how, much, they, are, willing, to, pay, for, the, various, services., There, were, two, options, to, pay, :, Pay, As, You, Go, -, Customers, can, pay, for, all, other, services, as, they, go., They, simply, select, the, title, they, wish, to, view, and, confirm, that, they, want, to, 'pay, and, play', at, the, displayed, price., They, can, watch, that, title, as, many, times, as, they, wish,, free, of, any, extra, charge,, within, a, 24, hour, period., Monthly, Subscription, -, Customers, can, choose, to, pay, a, monthly, subscription,, which, provides, unlimited, viewing, of, a, particular, service, at, a, fixed, price., Summary, of, payment, options, (June, 1995):, Pay, and, Play, (indicative, price, per, item), Monthly, Subscription, Movies, �1.50, to, �3.99, (not, available), Music, 99p, to, �3.99, �5.99, Education, free, to, �1.50, �4.99, Children's, 25p, �2.99,
