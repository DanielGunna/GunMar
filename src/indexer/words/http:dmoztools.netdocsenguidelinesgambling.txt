[DMOZ, Open, Directory, Project, Directory, About, DMOZ, Editing, Guidelines, Administrator, Meta, Catmod, Editall, Greenbuster, Kids, &, Teens, Regional, Travel, Gambling, Adult, Editor, Resources, In, Other, Languages, ODP, Gambling, Guidelines, Overview, Site, Listing, Guidelines, Describing, Sites, Spam, and, Repeated, Submissions, Overview, *Note, :, To, facilitate, the, comprehension, of, these, guidelines,, the, name, Gambling, will, be, used, to, refer, to, the, Games/Gambling, category, tree, instead, of, the, full, path, itself., The, following, guidelines, supplement, the, main, ODP, Guidelines, and, in, no, way, supersede, them., Gambling, editors, should, become, familiar, with, both, sets, of, guidelines., Generally, the, Gambling, category, includes, sites, whose, dominant, theme, is, either:, Online, casinos, where, users, can, win, prizes, and, money, by, betting, online., Information,, tips,, strategies,, rules, of, various, gambling, games, or, help, for, compulsive, gamblers., Sports, betting, services,, handicapping, services,, pools, or, general, information, on, sports, betting., Land-based, casinos, giving, information, on, their, services, and, facilities., Bingo, halls, general, information, or, online, bingo, sites, where, visitors, can, play, online., Lottery, results,, general, information,, software, or, online, lotteries, sites, where, visitors, can, buy, tickets, to, get, a, chance, to, win, prizes, and/or, cash., Gaming, equipment, dealers,, manufacturers,, rentals, and/or, sites, offering, staffing, services, for, special, occasion., Gambling, publications,, books, and/or, news, sites., Gambling, softwares, or, tools., Gambling, consultants, offering, turn-key, solutions, to, start, your, own, casino/sportsbook, or, any, related, services., When, evaluating, a, submission,, the, sites, to, which, it, links,, via, links, pages, or, banner, advertisements, for, example,, should, not, be, the, sole, factor, in, your, decision, as, to, whether, or, not, it, should, be, included., Gambling, is, often, associated, with, the, Adult, Industry., However,, no, adult, sites, will, be, accepted, in, the, Gambling, categories., Adult, gambling, sites, should, be, sent, to, the, appropriate, category, under, the, Adult, category, tree., Gambling, online, is, illegal, in, some, countries, therefore,, an, editor, living, in, a, country, where, it's, prohibited, should, not, edit, in, this, category., For, example,, no, online, gaming, company, is, allowed, to, accept, online, wagers, in, Canada, except, if, the, company, belongs, to, Native, American, (Indians)., However,, a, Canadian, company, is, allowed, to, produce, gambling, sites, as, long, as, the, company, is, licensed, in, a, country, where, online, gambling, is, fully, legislated, (such, as, Antigua), and, that, the, company's, servers, are, physically, located, in, a, country, where, online, gambling, is, legal, so, that, no, bets, will, take, place, in, Canada., This, is, why, Cryptologic, and, Worldgaming, are, legal, companies, despite, the, fact, that, they, are, both, located, in, Canada., In, the, United, States,, laws, can, be, different, from, a, state, to, another,, you, might, want, to, check, with, your, local, authorities, to, get, more, information., Site, Listing, Guidelines, No, site, is, guaranteed, placement, in, the, Open, Directory,, and, the, project, depends, on, editors, using, good, judgment, when, adding, content., The, goal, of, the, ODP, is, to, be, most, comprehensive, directory, of, quality, web, sites., This, goal, extends, to, the, Gambling, branch., Given, the, broad, scope, of, the, directory,, this, section, focuses, mostly, on, what, editors, should, not, include., Remember,, this, list, is, an, addendum, to, the, Sites, To, Include, or, Not, To, Include, section, of, the, general, ODP, Guidelines., Editors, should, use, both, sets, of, guidelines, to, drive, their, site, listing, decisions., Affiliate, Sites, Sites, that, (for, example), offer, products, or, services, provided, by, another, company, and, make, a, small, margin, on, the, sale., These, are, sometimes, called, reseller, or, franchise, sites., They, may, seem, to, have, unique, content,, but, the, product, descriptions, and/or, games, come, from, elsewhere., In, general, do, not, list, affiliate, sites, unless, the, affiliate, has, strong,, high, quality, content, of, its, own, that, end-users, will, find, really, useful., Online, Casinos, There's, a, lot, of, these, sites, submitted, in, the, Gambling, branch, every, day., Lot, of, these, sites, are, download-only, casinos., Such, sites, are, only, offering, a, downloadable, software, and, in, 99%, of, the, cases,, the, software, offered, is, already, offered, on, another, site, already, listed, in, the, directory., Therefore,, no, new, content, is, added, to, the, directory, and, these, sites, should, be, deleted, unless, they, offer, other, unique, content, that, could, justify, a, listing., Doorway, Sites, Sites, that, do, nothing, more, than, link, to, another, site, and, have, absolutely, no, content, of, their, own, are, doorway, sites., Many, Gambling, webmasters, obtain, multiple, domains, and, use, most, of, them, simply, to, point, or, redirect, to, a, single, main, site., Do, not, list, these, sites., Redirects, A, redirect, is, conceptually, similar, to, a, doorway, site, in, that, they, link, to, a, different, site., The, difference, between, the, two, is, that, the, redirect, link, is, automatic;, the, user, is, taken, to, the, new, site, without, having, to, click, anything., It, is, easy, to, miss, this., Never, list, redirects., A, unique, type, of, redirect, site, is, one, that, appears, fine, on, the, ODP,, but, once, a, downstream, data, user, like, AOL, picks, it, up,, the, site, redirects, to, content, that, we, would, otherwise, not, list., These, are, also, easy, to, miss,, and, in, order, to, catch, this, kind, of, spam;, Gambling, editors, need, to, work, as, a, team., Bait, &, Switch, You'll, often, see, cases, of, bait, &, switch, in, Gambling., Bait, &, switch, is, when, you, review, a, site,, then, you, decide, to, list, it, and, later, on,, you, discover, that, the, site, has, been, modified, in, such, a, way, that, it, no, longer, respects, our, guidelines., This, is, why, it, is, recommended, for, Gambling, editors, to, re-check, the, sites, in, "their", categories, once, in, a, while, just, to, make, sure, they, still, deserved, to, be, listed., If, you, know, of, some, submitters, using, this, technique,, you, should, contact, a, Meta,, Editall, or, CatMod, editor, so, that, appropriate, measures, can, be, taken., Mirror, Sites, These, have, exactly, the, same, content, as, another, site, (which, we'll, call, the, main, site)., They, may, exist, to, provide, users, with, faster, access, to, information, (e.g., having, a, mirror, of, a, US, site, on, a, server, in, Europe),, or, simply, be, much, like, doorway, sites., In, any, case,, they, are, not, to, be, listed., If, you, can, determine, what, the, main, site, is,, and, if, it, is, not, listed, already, then, list, that, one,, but, delete, any, other, mirrors, that, might, be, listed., Also,, two, (or, more), sites, offering, the, same, content, can, be, considered, as, "mirrors", (even, if, they, are, not, identical, in, design), and, only, one, of, these, mirrors, should, be, listed., In, general,, only, content-rich, sites, will, be, accepted, and, that, content, should, be, visible, and, easily, accessible., Note, :, To, facilitate, the, detection, of, mirror, sites,, it, is, strongly, recommended, that, you, use, the, URL, as, the, title, of, the, site., That, means, onlineblackjack.com, and, online-blackjack.com, would, have, the, same, title., You'll, notice, that, domain, names, with, lot, of, hyphens, tend, to, be, mirrors, of, bigger, sites., Advertising, Many, Gambling, sites, have, a, fair, share, of, affiliate, banner, ads,, full-page, ads,, and/or, consoles., The, guidelines, for, handling, sites, with, advertising, and, affiliate, links, are, as, follows:, Do, not, list, sites, where, advertising, and, affil
