Aida, Ebony, Phono, Cartridge:, Looking, For, Your, Last, Best, Cartridge?, This, Could, Be, It,, At, A, Decent, Price!, “This, seemed, to, me, what, Shure,, with, all, their, in-house, engineering, skill, and, experience, could, never, quite, achieve., That, elusive, combination, of, low, mass,, high, compliance,, and, supertracking, (a, phrase, they, coined,, I, think),, was, accompanied, by, the, seeming, necessity, of, removable, stylus, assemblies,, and, cleaning, brushes,, which,, I, discovered,, not, only, compromised, the, intimate, groove, interface,, but, also, were, quite, audibly, microphonic, in, truly, revealing, phono, systems,, adding, a, chatter, of, their, own, to, the, record-reproducing, conversation.”, A, Tale, of, Two, Headphones, from, Canada, by, NAD, VISO, &, Paradigm!, “Both, of, these, Canadian, companies, have, recently, introduced, quality, headphone, in-house, designs, for, the, audiophiile,, at, a, price, well, above, those, of, the, junk, that, we, associate, with, ex-rappers, and, tiny, Chinese, companies, trying, to, cause, premature, deafness, in, young, people, all, over, the, world., Thus,, there, is, a, somewhat, Messianic, quality, about, both, of, these, products,, and, the, cost, of, saving, your, ears, (if, not, your, soul),, is, perhaps, higher, than, what, many, subway, hangers-on, might, want, to, pay.”, HRS, M3X, Platform, Makes, Life, (or, at, least, Listening), More, Stable, “The, M3X, Isolation, Base, is, available, in, four, standard, sizes,, with, three, different, load, ranges, to, optimize, component, matching., Our, review, sample, was, 21, x, 19, x, 3″, (53.3, x, 48.3, x, 7.6, cm),, optimized, for, a, load, of, up, to, 52, lbs, (23.5, KG),, a, couple, of, inches, all, around, more, than, we, actually, needed., This, was,, in, fact,, better, than, it, being, too, small…”, Paradigm, Monitor, Series, 7, Sub, 10, Subwoofer, -, Extended,, Clean, Bass, From, A, Tiny, Box!, “Here, we, have, a, diminutive, little, sub,, with, quite, a, lot, of, engineering, effort, and, trickle-down, technology, from, previous, more, expensive, Paradigm, Signature, and, Reference, models., The, Monitor, 7, Sub, 10, is, quite, unassuming, in, both, size, and, cosmetics,, and, there, are, many, much, less, expensive, seemingly, comparable, models, out, there, from, both, reputable, speaker, companies, and, those, whose, products, are, as, concomitantly, compromised, technically, as, their, price, is, reduced.”, Origin, Live, Calypso, Turntable, and, Encounter, Tonearm, “The, Calypso, is, second, from, bottom, in, Origin, Live’s, stable, of, turntables,, a, belt-driven,, non-suspended, design, with, an, outboard, motor, pod., In, keeping, with, OL’s, design, philosophy, (which, can, be, read, in, detail, here), the, Calypso’s, plinth, and, sub-chassis, are, a, careful, combination, of, several, different, materials,, sized,, shaped,, positioned, and, joined, together, just, so, to, minimize, resonance….”, Bryston, B135, SST², Integrated, Amplifier/DAC, “This, all-purpose, amplifying, and, control, device, has, been, at, the, heart, of, my, audio, system, for, several, weeks, now,, first, as, a, basic, amp,, replacing, a, 3B, SST,, and, subsequently, operating, as, a, full, preamp/amp/DAC., I, won’t, say, that, it, has, surprised, me, a, lot,, but, it, is, a, case, where, familiarity, definitely, does, not, breed, contempt…”, Behringer, 1002B, Portable/Studio, Mixer, -, A, Remarkable, Recording, Tool,, Especially, At, The, Price!, “This, compact, battery/AC, small, mixer, is, just, one, part, of, a, multitude, of, pro, audio, gear, from, this, company,, which, engineers, and, designs, its, products, in, Germany,, and, manufactures, them, in, its, own, facility, (even, Apple, can’t, claim, THAT!), in, mainland, China., Their, catalog,, available, online,, a, pretty, good, read, for, any, budding, or, practicing, audio, engineer,, offers, a, vast, array, of, products,, many, for, very, targeted, uses,, and, this, little, beauty, turned, out, to, be, almost, exactly, what, I, was, looking, for, at, a, price, that, astounded, me!”, Audioquest, DragonFly, USB, DAC, “This, is, a, product, that, may, look, a, little, like, a, Dragonfly,, but, one, that, soars, more, like, a, Dragon, flying,, as, seen, in, various, special-effects-heavy, Hollywood, films, of, late., It’s, a, friendly, beast,, too,, easy, to, set, up, and, use, with, any, computer, of, today’s, normal, specs, for, USB, digital, audio, output., It, can, be, used, with, headphones,, powered, speakers, or, as, your, computer, output, into, an, audio, system., I, had, mine, going, in, 10, minutes, through, Windows, 7, in, my, new, Quad-core, i7, laptop, PC., AURALiC, Taurus, Headphone, Amplifier, &, Analog, Preamplifier, and, ARK, MX+, 96, kHz, Coaxial/USB, DAC, “AURALiC, is, a, Hong, Kong-based, company, that, has, its, own, very, specific,, and, special, ideas, about, designing, audio, components., With, ideals, based, around, classic, professional, products,, such, as, the, famous, and, revered, designs, of, Rupert, Neve,, the, company, sets, high, standards, for, itself.”, TASCAM, DR-680, High, Resolution, Digital, Recorder, “The, key, positive, info, about, this, recorder, is, that, it, will, record, 6, tracks, at, 96/24, resolution,, and, 2, at, 192/24,, if, you’re, feeling, especially, hair-shirt, purist., This, high, resolution, capability, for, 6, was, what, sold, me, on, this, machine., It’s, just, about, the, same, size, as, my, Edirol, R-4, (now, shakin’, in, Shanghai,, thanks, to, eBay),, which, served, me, well, for, a, few, years,, but, more, versatile,, not, locked, to, a, 40, GB, hard, disc,, and, allowing, up, to, 32, GB, SDHC, cards,, which, I, mainly, used, for, outdoor, recording, at, the, cottage,, along, with, a, couple, of, 16, GB, cards…”, Latest, Articles, Audio, Ideas:, Open, Reel, Wow, and, Flutter?, It, May, Be, The, Pinch, Roller!, “Here’s, a, story, for, you, that, befits, an, aging, audiophile., Some, months, ago,, I, was, looking, for, a, used, 1/4-track, reel-to-reel, recorder,, and, though, it, wasn’t, a, prime, requirement,, the, capability, of, handling, big, (10, 1/2″), reels, was, just, one, criterion., That, narrowed, the, field, quite, considerably,, and, after, looking, at, a, number, of, Akai,, Otari,, ReVox,, Tandberg,, TEAC, and, other, recorders, available,, I, finally, found, what, I, was, looking, for, at, a, decent, price,, and, more, important,, close, enough, geographically, for, pickup., This, latter, consideration, is, important, when, dealing, with, these, large,, heavy, recorders,, because, they, are, very, expensive, to, ship,, that, cost, often, exceeding, the, actual, selling, price,, especially, from, US, or, overseas, locations.”, AUDIO, IDEAS:, Not-So-Audio-Related, Thoughts, About, Clouds,, Passwords, &, Controlling, Remotely!, “Cloud, Computing, -, It’s, like, entrusting, your, candy, to, the, babysitter,, or, your, booze, to, the, handyman., You’ll, look, up, and, find, your, cloud, gone., It’s, inevitable., I, put, my, trust, in, USB, drives, (I, have, a, 250-Gig),, SDHC, (XC?), cards, (great, for, recording, music, these, days),, DVD-Rs,, and, now, Blu-ray-Rs.”, “I, guess, other, people, worry, about, identity, theft., I, worry, about, identity, DENIAL!”, “And, the, fact, is,, there, is,, as, far, as, my, extensive, experience, has, shown,, no, true, universal, remote, in, existence., They, all,, like, the, rest, of, us, humans,, have, obvious, flaws, and, blind, spots.”, OX, BOX, #11, -, Sibelius,, Beethoven,, Respighi,, Mozart,, and, More…, “I, took, a, considerable, length, of, time, listening, to, and, reflecting, on, the, Sibelius, 5th., Let, me, write, about, it, first,, as, there, will, be, some, things, as, a, recording, and, performance, that, it, shares, with, the, rest., Let’s, begin, where, many, classical, music, reviews, finish,, with, consideration, of, the, sound., From, their, inception, BIS, have, considered, the, way, they, record, (with, the, simplest, setups, possible), to, be, as, important, as, what, they, record., I, would, contend, this, is, a, big, reason, for, their, success…”, Hy, End, -, Bruckner,, Brahms,, &, Bang-Bang, Lang, Lang, Liszt,, by, Hy, Sarick, “Here,, the, showiest, of, pianists, encounters, the, showiest, of, composers,, and, produces, a, stunning, disc, of, great, passion, and, virtuosity., Lang, has, been, a, devotee, of, Liszt’s, work, from, the, age, of, 2,

the, first, really, workable, bass, clarinet,, installed, a, bass, clarinet, mouthpiece, on, one, of, his, firm’s, ophicleides., He, was, aware, of, the, tonal, disparity, among, strings,, winds,, and, brass,, families;, in, which, the, strings, and, winds, were, generally, overpowered, by, the, brass., What, he, produced, was,, in, essence,, a, brass, clarinet,, and, while, he, thought, in, terms, of, a, family, of, such,, and, would, soon, expand, the, line, accordingly;, the, first, of, what, he, would, call, Saxophone,, deriving, from, the, ophicleide,, was, a, bass, instrument., This, he, patented, in, Paris, in, 1846…”, A, Trialogue, on, Historical, Recording, Restoration, by, AM,, JEB,, &, BO, “Even, the, process, of, removing, recording, noise, that, often, obscures, the, first, and, second, overtones, ensures, that, they, cannot, be, synthesized, out, of, thin, air,, again,, literally., In, a, mono, recording, all, the, noise, and, distortion, are, part, and, parcel, of, the, production,, and, cannot, be, removed, except, at, a, cost…”, Audio, Ideas,, December, 2011, -, Recent, SACDs,, CDs,, Blu-rays,, &, Other, Confections, (Or, Not)!, “These, two, titles, couldn’t, be, any, different, from, each, other,, I’m, sure,, but, they, share, an, excellence, of, production, and, execution,, and, each, focuses, on, a, major, musical, talent, whose, careers, started, more, than, 40, years, apart., Chasing, Sound, is, a, look, at, the, career, and, guitar, and, recording, innovations, of, Les, Paul,, not, to, forget, his, spectacular, musical, dexterity, with, the, electric, guitar, he, invented., Paired, with, the, irrepressibly, pitch-perfect, Mary, Ford,, they, became, a, hit, machine, in, the, early, 50s,, his, development, of, overdub, recording, the, perfect, way, to, showcase, her, singing, and, unique, harmonies…”, Ox, Box, #10, -, Music, from, Jimmy, Cobb,, Mozart,, Martinu, and, Robert, Plant, “Most, collectors, will, be, attracted, to, the, Chesky, discs, because, of, great, care, the, Chesky, team, takes, to, get, the, most, “natural”, sound, they, can, obtain., On, the, end, of, a, horizontal, arm, they, attach, a, single,

when, all, the, dust, will, settle., As, a, youngster,, I, lived, through, the, first, 3D, bubble,, which, like, a, balloon,, quickly, deflated, as, the, thrill, wore, off., I, remember, ducking, the,
