&, II, (Cuneiform,, 2017), This, is, an, interesting, and, effervescent, big, band, album, with, saxophonist, and, composer, Ed, Palermo's, talented, jazz, orchestra, moving, through, a, very, lengthy, selection, of, arrangements, of, British, progressive, rock, songs, from, the, the, nineteen, sixties, and, early, nineteen, seventies., These, years, were, formative, ones, for, that, genre, as, well, as, progressive, big, bands, led, by, the, likes, of, Don, Ellis., Palermo, is, best, known, for, interpreting, the, compositions, of, Frank, Zappa,, and, he, takes, that, experience, and, brings, it, to, the, songs, he, grew, up, to, make, an, album, makes, for, a, loving, if, exhausting, double, album., His, band, members, are, highly, talented, musicians, which, play, the, charts, with, enthusiasm, and, this, makes, for, music, which, is, accessible, for, both, jazz, and, rock, fans., Beginning,, as, it, always, seems, to,, with, The, Beatles,, the, band, bounces, through, "Good, Morning,, Good, Morning", and, a, violin, tinged, version, of, "Eleanor, Rigby.", There, are, short, sections, of, jokey, banter, between, some, of, the, tracks, like, the, trippy, and, swirling, take, on, The, Rolling, Stones's, "We, Love, You.", The, more, complex, music, of, King, Crimson, is, just, the, ticket, for, this, group,, and, their, versions, of, "Larks', Tongues, in, Aspic,, Part, One", features, nervous, percussion, and, violin, while, "21st, Century, Schizoid, Man", adds, vocals, for, an, epic, and, imposing, feel., Disc, two, goes, off, topic, briefly,, channeling, The, Nice's, controversial, organ, drenched, reading, of, Leonard, Bernstein's, "America", and, then, tacking, on, a, brief, snarky, cover, of, Green, Day's, "American, Idiot.", They, follow, these, performances, with, a, nice, spacey, interlude, of, "Diamond, Dust", and, Traffic's, "The, Low, Spark, of, High, Heeled, Boys.", The, organ, drenched, madness, of, Arthur, Brown's, "Fire", gets, things, moving, again, before, the, group, returns, to, where, it, all, started, with, a, trio, of, Beatles, songs, to, finish, the, album., This, may, be, an, exercise, in, nostalgia,, but, the, arrangements, and, the, high, quality, of, the, ensemble, playing, and, soloists, keep, the, music, fresh, and, interesting. The, Great, Un-American, Songbook,, Volumes, I, &, II, -,

unique, enthusiasm, about, life, and, music, and, use, this, outlook, to, create, an, impressive, method, of, interacting, with, other, musicians, that, is, continuously, lively, and, refreshing., Volume, five, of, The, Art, of, Perelman, -, Shipp, series, returns, to, the, quartet, format, with, a, crackling, band, consisting, of, Perelman, on, tenor, saxophone,, Shipp, on, piano,, Michael, Bisio, on, bass, and, Whit, Dickey, on, drums., Perelman's, quavering, sound, ushers, in, "Part, 1", with, an, emotional, and, distinctive, saxophone, tone, leading, the, way, over, simmering, rhythm, accompaniment,, developing, a, memorable, collective, improvisation,, that, buzzes, loud, and, furiously, in, a, powerful, performance., This, is, a, lengthy, improvisation,, and, Perelman, steps, aside, at, one, point, for, a, potent, section, of, piano,, bass, and, drums, before, returning, and, melding, with, the, group, and, building, up, to, a, powerful, finish, from, a, fine, bass, solo., "Part, 2", develops, from, a, subtle, and, strong, foundation,, allowing, the, music, to, move, in, any, direction, the, four, choose,, easing, into, "Part, 3", which, kneads, in, a, boiling, free-bop, sensibility, of, rippling, piano,, taut, bass, and, drums,, and, Perelman's, epic, post-Ayler, tenor, saxophone., The, rhythm, section, is, in, fine, mettle, with, Shipp, dropping, the, occasional, lower, end, depth, charge,, and, Bisio, and, Dickey, shifting, the, pulse, and, swing, of, the, music, relentlessly., Raw, and, rending, sounds, splice, though, "Part, 4", creating, interesting, musical, shapes, that, are, in, continuous, motion, within, which, the, band's, energy, and, patience, gives, the, music, a, readily, identifiable, sound., Subtle, and, impressive, bass, opens, "Part, 5", setting, the, pace, for, the, exhilarating, entry, of, the, remaining, instruments., From, this, a, vital, collective, improvisation, that, is, born,, with, the, music, bursting, out, like, a, supernovae,, enlightening, everything, around, it., There, is, a, flurry, of, notes, from, Perelman's, saxophone, that, takes, the, music, to, an, even, higher, level, with, muscular, accompaniment, which, powers, the, music, while, also, dynamically, allowing, the, music, to, breathe, in, space, and, time., "Part, 6", has, Pelelman's, saxophone, sweeping, across, the, sound, stage,, interacting, with, his, fellow, musicians, and, letting, the, moment, fearlessly, take, them, into, their, improvisation., The, music, turns, darker, and, harsher,, like, a, sudden, storm, that, comes, crashing, down, from, the, sky,, climaxing, in, a, massive, downpour, of, sound, that, is, one, of, the, most, thrilling, aspects, of, this, album., The, concluding, "Part, 7", develops, a, quieter, and, moodier, sound,, building, into, a, bracing, improvisation, of, shifting, rhythm, and, stark, peals, of, saxophone., Ivo, Perelman, and, Matthew, Shipp, have, a, very, strong, work, ethic, as, can, be, seen, on, this, album, and, on, the, series, as, a, whole., They, have, a, seemingly, limitless, well, of, ideas, and, use, them, to, create, endlessly, compelling, music. Vol, 5:,

to, the, fullest, on, his, newest, album,, where, the, songs, are, inspired, by, the, trickster, myths, of, many, different, cultures., Since, these, characters, are, well, known, for, slight, of, hand, and, offering, things, that, are, not, always, what, they, seem,, these, stories, make, for, fine, raw, material, which, can, be, used, to, create, composed, and, improvised, music, that, is, thoughtful, and, challenging., On, this, album,, Okazaki, is, joined, by, Craig, Taborn, on, piano,, Anthony, Tidd, on, bass, and, Sean, Rickman, on, drums., The, music, they, make, is, complex, yet, accessible,, and, takes, the, listener, on, a, journey, through, a, wide, range, of, music,, opening, with, "Kudzu", where, there, is, a, subtle, rhythm, that, all, of, the, musicians, use, as, a, jumping, off, point, with, rippling, piano, and, guitar, leading, the, way,, including, a, spirited, piano, solo, from, Taborn,, before, the, group, comes, together, to, close, out, the, piece., The, music, is, faster, and, more, urgent, on, "Box, in, a, Box,", and, the, combination, of, instruments, allows, for, varying, degrees, of, intricacy, in, the, improvised, section., They, show, a, bold, imagination,, stretching, into, unexpected, areas,, with, brightly, percussive, piano, and, thoughtful, drumming, cutting, a, path, through, the, music., The, leader's, guitar, is, interwoven, with, the, other, instruments,, snaking, though, in, an, impressive, fashion., "Eating, Earth", has, a, mysterious, vibe, to, it,, with, guitar, and, piano, opening, the, tune,, and, then, bass, and, drums, filling, in, some, of, the, wide, open, space., Gentle, piano, chords, frame, the, music,, with, big, droplets, of, sound, falling, from, the, sky, amidst, subtle, drumming., The, music, has, a, shape-shifting, nature, to, it, and, that, brings, a, unique, approach, to, their, improvising,, ending, with, a, haunting, piano, coda., There, is, a, rapid, sensibility, to, "Black, Bolt,", which, is, a, short, and, fast, piece, of, music, that, moves, forward, relentlessly,, with, sparks, of, guitar, and, thick, bass, and, drums, demonstrating, that, stylistic, cliches, are, not, hinderances, to, their, music., Muscular, and, rippling, percussion, and, guitar, open, "The, West", and, build, a, great, deal, of, enthusiasm, into, the, performance,, never, landing, in, one, set, groove,, but, providing, propulsion, for, a, wide, range, of, possibilities, and, playing, with, an, impressive, devotion, and, dedication., "The, Calendar", follows, immediately,, and, develops, over, nine, minutes, that, cover, a, ride, range, of, territory,, engaging, the, head, and, body, and, melding, both, into, a, very, compelling, improvisation, through, which, the, musicians, express, their, thoughts, with, prickly, guitar, and, bounding, rhythm, which, adds, clarity, and, drive., "Caduceus", is, quietly, complex,, softly, exploring, the, nature, of, their, chosen, music., Taborn, then, jumps, in,, infusing, the, music, with, a, bright, modern, jazz, improvisation, that, brings, a, freshness, to, the, music, like, a, cool, breeze, and, allows, the, true, spirit, of, the, music, to, emerge., Stark, accompanied, guitar, is, at, the, center, of, the, concluding, "Borderland", developing, a, haunted, and, sly, sound, that, perfectly, fits, the, overall, theme, of, the, music., This, is, a, very, good, album,, and, the, idea, of, taking, inspiration, from, myths, and, legends, provides, a, rich, tapestry, for, the, musicians, to, explore, beyond, the, conventional, borders, of, jazz. Trickster, -, amazon.com, Send, comments, to, Tim., Posted, by, Tim, Niland, at, 2:44, PM, Labels:, Anthony, Tidd,, Craig, Taborn,, jazz,, Miles, Okazaki,, Sean, Rickman, Monday,, April, 03,,

“Part, 1”, which, shows, a, gentler, side, of, the, music, with, Perelman’s, lush, breathy, saxophone, met, by, soft, piano, and, full, bodied, bass., The, music, is, spacious, and, wide, open,, and, the, musicians, are, patient, in, letting, it, develop, of, its, own, accord., “Part, 2”, takes, things, up, a, notch, with, a, stronger, and, faster, collective, improvisation., The, music, sounds,
