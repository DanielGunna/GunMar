NewsBlogFavoritesContact, View, More, Traditional, zulu, ceramics, The, history, of, traditional, Zulu, ceramics, is, not, perfectly, understood.  , Until, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, basketry, was, probably, the, principle, type, of, container, used, by, the, Zulu, including, containers, for, liquids. , Archaeological, shards, discovered, in, areas, currently, occupied, by, the, Zulu, suggest, that, pottery, making, is, ancient, but, few, shards, of, blackened, vessels, –, now, considered, ‘classic’, Zulu, ceramics, –, have, been, discovered. , As, Zulu, culture, evolved, from, basically, a, pastoral, one, to, one, of, large, concentrations, of, permanent, settlements, the, need, for, durable, vessels, fostered, pottery, making., By, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, tradition, of, blackened, (, reduction-fired, ), vessels, was, well, established., Photos, of, the, Zulu, court, taken, near, the, turn, of, the, 19th, century, show, many, well, -made, large, beer, vessels, (ukhamba), on, display.,  , Zulu, vessels, are, made, of, earthenware, clay;, an, iron-rich, clay, that, matures, at, a, relatively, low, temperature.  , Most, traditional, ceramics, the, world, over, are, made, of, earthenware.  , Firing, earthenware, does, not, require, a, kiln. , Pots, can, be, fired, in, the, open, with, readably, available, fuel., In, the, case, of, contemporary, Zulu, potters, this, fuel, is, often, the, dried, leaves, of, giant, aloe, plants., Firing, is, rapid, and, dramatic, and, requires, great, skill, to, ‘read’, the, smoke, and, flames.,  , Zulu, pottery,, traditionally, the, craft, of, women,, is, hand-built, rather, than, thrown, on, a, potter’s, wheel., The, superb, balance, and, perfect, symmetry, of, many, Zulu, vessels, is, only, possible, by, years, –, and, generations, –, of, potting. , In, general, the, making, of, Zulu, pots, is, very, low-tech, and, very, high, skill.,  , The, clay, is, dug, by, hand, from, a, suitable, site, –, often, a, considerable, distance, from, the, potter’s, home., It, is, dried,, ground, into, a, fine, powder, and, cleaned, of, any, organic, material,, stones,, or, other, impurities. , Following, this, very, laborious, process, it, is, mixed, with, water, to, the, appropriate, consistency, and, often, aged. , Each, potter, has, a, distinct, ‘hand’, that, may, reflect, slight, differences, in, the, process, of, making, the, vessel., Generally, the, process, involves, building, up, the, walls, of, the, vessel, by, adding, thick, coils, of, clay,, one, atop, each, other,, blending, them, together,, and, smoothing, the, surface, which, may, include, scrapping, the, interior, to, thin, the, walls. , When, the, pot, is, partially, dry, –, about, leather-hard, –, the, potter, will, decorate, the, surface, with, appliqué, designs, (, amasumpa), or, etched, fine-line, patterns. , After, all, decoration, is, finished, the, outer, surface, is, polished, with, a, smooth, stone, or, metal, tool. , This, compresses, the, clay, molecules, and, produces, a, hard,, shiny,, durable, surface. , After, carefully, drying, the, pot, it, is, fired.  , If, it, is, to, have, a, blackened, surface, it, is, fired, twice;, once, in, an, oxidation, firing, that, results, in, a, red, surface, and, once, in, a, reduction, firing, that, darkens, the, surface., The, later, involves, introducing, an, excess, of, fuel, during, the, firing, in, which, case, the, necessary, oxygen, required, for, combustion, is, drawn, from, the, clay, rather, that, the, atmosphere., Iron, turns, black, in, such, a, firing.,  , Several, different, types, of, vessels, were, made, to, supply, the, traditional, market. , Not, all, women, were, potters. , Many, supplied, vessels, upon, commission, or, sold, their, wares, in, regional, markets. , Blackened, vessels, were, reserved, for, ceremonial, use, whereas, red, vessels, were, utilitarian.  , This, exhibition, contains, mostly, ukhamba, –, vessels, used, for, the, ceremonial, serving, of, beer, in, honor, of, ancestors, and, other, special, ceremonies.,  There, is, also, one, example, of, an, izimbiza, –, the, very, large, reddish, vessel, used, for, brewing, the, beer. , Several, of, the, huge,, pumpkin-shaped, vessels, in, this, exhibition, were, commissioned, for, weddings. , The, thinness, of, the, walls,, the, symmetry, of, the, forms, and, the, sheer, size, of, each, vessel, are, remarkable, among, contemporary, Zulu, wares.,  , We, first, began, collection, Nzuza’s, vessels, approximately, ten, years, ago, without, knowing,, at, that, time,, that, they, were, made, by, her.  , All, the, pots, were, purchased, from, other, Zulu, households, that, had, purchased, them, from, Nzuza, in, the, past. , Later,, after, identifying, Nzuza, as, the, maker,, her, daughter, became, instrumental, in, finding, old, pots, that, her, mother, had, made. , David, Roberts,, a, Durban-, based, South, African, with, a, deep, knowledge, of, Zulu, culture,, was, the, first, to, systematically, seek, out, and, collect, Nzuza’s, pottery, with, the, assistance, of, Nzuza’s, daughter, and, a, Zulu, colleague. , In, this, process, he, became, a, close, and, trusted, friend, of, Nzuza. , We, visited, Nzuza, in, her, remote, traditional, kraal, in, January, of, 2017, where, we, were, welcomed, warmly, and, enthusiastically. , This, is, the, first, comprehensive, exhibition, of, her, work.  , A, portion, of, the, proceeds, of, sales, from, this, exhibition, will, be, given, to, Nzuza, or, an, institution, she, favors.,  ,  , Further, Reading:,  , Jolles,, Frank., Zulu, Beer, Vessels. , Kranj:, Gorenjski , tisk, storitve,2015,  , Perrill,, Elizabeth., Zulu, Pottery., San, Michael:, Print,
