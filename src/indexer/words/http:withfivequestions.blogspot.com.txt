[With, Five, Questions, -, conversations, with, creative, professionals, in, business, and, the, arts, -, Pages, Home, About, Friday,, April, 7,, 2017, Meet, Eric, of, Average, Joe, Arbitrage, Eric, J., Wynn, is, a, professional, traveler;, he, spends, an, average, of, 350, days, per, year, traveling, and, has, developed, and, learned, a, number, of, techniques, for, travel, hacking,, credit, hacking,, and, earning, extra, money., He, created, a, website, called, Average, Joe, Arbitrage, to, share, his, travel, arbitrage, tips, and, other, ideas, for, readers, who, want, to, save, and, make, money., To, get, an, idea, of, his, writing, and, the, tips, he, shares,, check, out, these, recent, articles, on, the, benefits, of, brand, loyalty, and, how, to, make, the, most, of, store, specials, to, make, money, rather, than, spending, it., 1., How, did, you, choose, the, name, of, your, site,, Average, Joe, Arbitrage?, Also,, for, readers, unfamiliar, with, the, word,, what, does, "arbitrage", mean?, I, consider, myself, just, an, average, person,, who, lives, a, rather, unusual, life., And, I, wanted, to, share, what, I, have, learned, at, making, extra, money, and, living, a, better, life, with, average, people., Arbitrage, is, the, knack, or, art, of, finding, something, valued, at, X, dollars, but, knowing, you, can, sell, it, for, Y, dollars., And,, then, capitalizing, on, that, trade., 2., As, someone, who, travels, for, much, of, the, year,, where, do, you, most, like, to, spend, your, time?, I, normally, spend, about, 90, days, in, one, spot;, then, I, pack, and, move, up, to, another, spot., It, is, a, very, nomadic, lifestyle., But,, I, am, fascinated, with, seeing, America., Every, location, has, its, uniqueness;, Boston, has, its, museums;, Nebraska, has, its, prairies., Every, location, in, America, is, unique, and, has, something, fascinating, about, it., But,, my, heart, is, with, the, beach,, and, I, truly, relish, my, time, along, the, beaches,, listening, to, the, sound, of, the, waves,, the, cry, of, the, gulls,, and, the, smell, of, salt, air., 3., What, are, some, of, your, favorite, ways, to, make, (and, save), money,, and, how, do, you, keep, your, business, operations, easily, portable, to, accommodate, your, traveling?, I, make, money, in, numerous, ways., I, do, a, lot, of, secret, shopping;, I, seek, out, arbitrage, opportunities, with, retailers,, and, I, take, advantage, of, pricing, anomalies, that, they, have., For, saving, money,, I, always, buy, with, coupons., I, never, want, to, pay, retail., My, favorite, way, method, of, couponing, right, now, is, using, the, shopping, app, Ibotta, which, is, available, in, the, Apple, App, store., It, is, the, easiest, fastest, way, I, have, found, to, get, rebates., On, a, side, note,, if, you, download, the, Ibotta, app,, and, use, my, referral, code,, qffkbsh,, you, will, get, a, $10.00, welcome, bonus., My, gift, to, you..., 4., Why, is, it, important, for, people, to, utilize, multiple, ways, of, making/saving, money,, rather, than, just, focusing, on, one, specific, hack, or, project?, We, live, in, an, economy, in, which, is, going, to, get, harder, and, harder, for, people, to, make, ends, meet., By, developing, multiple, income, streams,, people, can, better, absorb, these, difficulties, and, in, turn, live, a, better, life, for, their, themselves, and, their, families., 5., Can, you, share, some, of, your, all-time, favorite, deals, you've, found--and, what, are, your, tips, for, readers, who, want, to, find, great, deals,, too?, Last, Christmas,, a, retailer, offered, a, $10, discount,, for, every, hundred, dollars, in, gift, cards, purchased., That, is, a, 10%, savings, right, there., Better, than, any, savings, account, and, I, purchased, 15, of, these, gift, cards., But,, the, week, before, Christmas,, the, retailer, adjusted, the, sale,, and, I, was, able, to, purchase, $500.00, gift, cards, for, $450.00., I, purchased, 20, of, these, gifts, cards., I, grossed, $1,150.00, for, my, Christmas, shopping!, I, think, people, should, know, how, to, find, these, deals,, and, I, am, just, interested, in, sharing, my, techniques., The, secret, to, this, is, reading, my, blog, and, keeping, an, eye, open, for, these, unique, deals., If, you, scroll, through, my, blog,, I, post, a, copy, of, the, ad, the, retailer, posted., It, was, no, secret;, millions, of, people, saw, it., But,, how, many, took, advantage, of, it?, Thanks,, Eric!, Posted, by, Amanda, Laughtland, at, 8:14, PM, No, comments:,

home,, writer, Monday,, April, 3,, 2017, Meet, Christy, Renier,, Consultant, in, Change, Management, Christy, Renier, is, a, change, management, and, communications, professional., In, March, 2016,, she, left, the, corporate, world, to, go, to, work, as, a, change, management, consultant., In, January, of, this, year,, she, launched, Renier, Consulting,, LLC, which, is, her, very, own, Change, Management, and, Communications, consulting, business., Christy, is, just, putting, the, finishing, touches, on, her, new, website,, so, keep, an, eye, on, www.renierconsulting.org., You, can, also, learn, more, about, her, by, visiting, her, LinkedIn, page., 1., What, made, you, decide, to, leave, the, corporate, world?, There, were, many, factors, that, went, into, my, decision, to, leave, the, corporate, world., When, I, was, young,, I, dreamed, of, starting, my, own, business, some, day., My, dad, was, a, business, owner,, so, you, can, say, it, is, in, my, blood., I, also, saw, how, hard, he, worked, his, whole, life, and, knew, my, timing, was, critical., So,, instead, of, going, into, business, for, myself,, I, went, to, work, for, a, global, Fortune, 500, company,, knowing, that, my, dream, would, come, true, one, day., Now,, here, we, are, nearly, 17, years, later,, and, I've, been, working, with, the, same, Fortune, 500, company., Throughout, the, years, I've, gained, a, wide, range, of, global, business, experience, and, honed, my, industry, knowledge,, so, I, was, feeling, confident, that, if, I, were, on, my, own,, I, could, deliver, expert, services, with, a, professional, experience, for, my, clients., Next,, I, had, a, fantastic, support, system:, -, a, business, mentor, who, encouraged, me,, -, a, family, that, supported, me,, and, -, a, strong, professional, network., The, time, was, right;, the, time, was, now...!, 2., How, did, you, come, to, focus, on, change, management, in, your, work?, For, me,, there, really, was, no, other, choice., Change, management, is, my, passion, because, I, care, about, people., And,, at, the, heart, of, change, management,, it, is, all, about, people., Over, the, past, 17, years,, I've, worked, in, a, variety, of, the, "softer, sides", of, IT, which, tend, to, fall, under, the, change, category:, training,, technical, documentation,, project, management,, resource, management,, organizational, design,, executive, communications,, and, strategic, planning., So,, when, I, combine, my, passion, with, my, skills, and, experience,, I, invoke, what, I, like, to, call, the, "trifecta, for, success.", Passion(Skills, +, Experience), =, Trifecta, Success., So,, choosing, my, focus, was, as, simple, as, P(S+E)., 3., What, exactly, does, change, management, mean?, Change, management,, simply, stated,, is, the, act, of, managing, the, "people, side", of, an, organizational, change., An, organizational, change, is, when, a, company, takes, action, to, make, an, improvement, in, some, way,, such, as, reduce, costs,, improve, revenues,, solve, problems,, align, work, and, strategy,, or, improve, efficiency/effectiveness, within, the, company., People, can, have, a, reaction, as, a, result, of, this, change,, both, internally, and, externally., Having, a, robust, change, management, strategy, and, a, rock, star, change, manager, on, your, project, team, will, is, improve, the, likelihood, of, success, and, the, overall, return, on, investment, for, the, project., 4., Why, does, communication, have, such, an, important, role, in, change, management?, The, majority, of, the, communications, roles, I, have, had, over, the, past, 17, years, were, related, to, change, management, activities..., and, at, the, heart, of, every, great, change, management, strategy, is, a, solid, communications, plan., Managing, the, human, side, of, change, is, heavily, based, on, communications., It, is, extremely, important, for, leaders, to, be, authentic, and, honest, when, communicating, with, people, who, will, be, impacted, by, any, company, changes., Employees, should, feel, respected, and, well, informed, every, step, of, the, way., Thanks,, Christy!, Posted, by,

management,, technology, Tuesday,, March, 28,, 2017, Meet, Kristi, McAllister,, Blogger, at, Truly, Madly, Sassy, Kristi, McAllister, recently, started, the, blog,, Truly, Madly, Sassy,, which, she, describes, as, a, personal, blog, about, grief,, hope,, loss,, love,, transition,, and, the, perils, of, everyday, life., She, lives, in, North, Carolina,, where, she, enjoys, such, hobbies, as, baking, cupcakes, and, indulging, in, Starbucks, beverages., The, best, way, to, learn, about, what's, important, to, Kristi, is, to, read, her, blog!, 1., What, inspired, you, to, start, blogging?, For, years,, I've, had, friends, tell, me, that, I, had, a, great, way, with, words,, but, I, never, really, thought, about, it,, to, be, honest., Then,, back, in, the, fall, semester, of, 2016,, one, of, my, favorite, professors,, Wayne, Loving,, had, asked, our, Economics, class, to, post, something, on, the, discussion, board, about, why, we, chose, our, particular, major, (mine, is, social, work),, so, I, posted, about, a, friend, who, had, committed, suicide, the, year, prior., Mr., Loving, publicly, commented, on, that, post, about, how, well, I, articulated, things, and, from, that, day, forward,, he, continued, to, prod, me, to, start, a, blog, so, that, I, could, help, others., I, completely, give, him, all, the, accolades, for, what, has, become, Truly, Madly, Sassy, because, his, encouragement, alone, is, what, led, me, to, start, it., Even, today,, he, occasionally, sends, me, an, email, cheering, me, on, so, that, I, keep, things, going!, Professors, like, him, are, hard, to, come, by,, and, I, feel, so, fortunate, to, have, had, him, because, he, truly, cares, about, his, students, and, wants, all, of, us, to, succeed, at, whatever, we're, good, at., 2., How, do, you, choose, the, topics, to, cover, in, your, posts?, Interestingly, enough,, most, of, the, things, I, cover, in, my, blog, posts, are, directly, related, to, my, own, life, experiences., I've, often, found, that, living, transparently, and, authentically, means, being, open, and, honest, about, all, of, our, wounds, because, in, talking, about, those, things,, we, not, only, heal, ourselves, but, others, as, well., At, other, times,, I'll, just, get, a, hint, of, inspiration, and, wonder, about, things, like, what, people, might, regret, in, their, lives., My, friends, are, my, biggest, fans, and, they’re, always, willing, to, take, part, in, informal, Facebook, polls, by, baring, their, souls, to, me, so, that, I, can, build, a, blog, around, their, answers., Honestly,, it's, all, rather, spontaneous, and, rarely, planned., I, have, to, chew, on, things, a, long, time, before, I, can, sit, down, and, put, something, together, that's, coherent!, 3., Do, you, have, any, special, goals, you, hope, to, achieve, through, your, website?, It, might, sound, cliché,, but, I, didn't, start, the, blog, to, make, money,, although, I, would, welcome, it, if, that, ever, came, about!, But, my, biggest, goal, is, to, help, others, who, might, be, enduring, circumstances, that, seem, unbearable., Many, of, us, have, crawled, through, hopelessness, and, sometimes,, we, feel, insignificant, because, of, that., If, I, can, reach, one, person, who, might, be, struggling, with, a, relationship,, a, loss,, or, someone, who, is, seeking, hope, in, a, dismal, moment,, I, feel, that, I've, done, my, part, in, bettering, humanity, by, letting, them, know, that, there’s, always, a, little, light, somewhere, if, we, just, grab, onto, it., 4., What, are, some, other, websites, that, inspire, you?, Iyanla, Vanzant's, website, is, always, one, that, I, frequently, look, at, because, in, so, many, ways,, I, relate, to, her, life, experiences., Not, only, that,, I, love, her, books., I, rarely, keep, a, book, that, I've, read,, but, I, keep, all, of, hers!, Elizabeth, Gilbert's, website, is, equally, awesome, because, she, always, has, some, sort, of, interesting, podcast, that, I, can, find, hope, in., And, last, but, certainly, not, least,, Brene, Brown, is, my, hero, and, her, website, is, the, bomb, diggity!, I, absolutely, adore, her, work,, especially, where, courage, and, vulnerability, is, concerned., That, woman, inspires, me, every, day, to, be, real!, 5., Do, you, have, a, particular, idea, of, your, reader(s), in, mind, as, you, write,, and, what, would, you, most, like, potential, visitors, to, your, blog, to, know, about, you?, I, think, Truly, Madly, Sassy, has, something, for, everybody,, honestly., Most, subjects, revolve, around, love, and, relationships, of, all, sorts,, and, who, hasn't, had, ups, and, downs, with, both, of, those?!, I'd, say, most, of, my, readers, are, women,, but, I, have, had, comments, from, men, here, and, there, on, particular, posts., I, don't, really, sit, down, and, say, "Okay,, I, need, to, target, this, audience, today"--I, just, write!, I, think, as, writers,, being, raw, and, real, with, our, own, scars, allow, the, readers, who, follow, us, to, relate, not, only, to, our, stories,, but, to, theirs, as, well., It's, always, comforting, to, me, when, I, go, through, hard, times, to, hear, another, person, say, "Me, too!"., I, suppose, if, I, wanted, potential, visitors, to, know, anything, about, me,, it, would, be, this:, I, am, far, from, perfect, and, fight, the, daily, battle, of, feeling, "good, enough", in, a, big, world, of, edits;, however,, my, life, experiences, have, made, me, the, woman, I, am, today, and, continue, to, shape, me, into, the, person, I, ultimately, want, to, become., We, all, have, room, for, improvement;, not, only, that,, we, are, all, capable, of, being, better, people, day, in, and, day, out, if, we, just, work, at, it., That's, a, long, explanation,, so, the, short, version, is, this:, I'm, just, a, real, person, with, real, wounds, who, inspires, to, help, others, grow, as, I, gain, personal, growth, myself., It's, all, about, transparency!, Thanks,, Kristi!, Posted, by, Amanda, Laughtland, at, 9:42, PM, No, comments:, Email, ThisBlogThis!Share, to, TwitterShare, to, FacebookShare, to, Pinterest, Labels:, author,, blogger,, blogging,, nonfiction,, North, Carolina,, positive, content,, writer, Wednesday,, March, 22,, 2017, Meet, Robin, Waters, Casper,, Author, and, Therapist, Meet, Robin, Waters, Casper, is, a, Licensed, Marriage, and, Family, Therapist,, a, Certified, Reiki, Master, Teacher,, an, author,, and, a, publisher., She, enjoys, writing, books, for, children, of, all, ages,, and, publishing, books, in, a, variety, of, genres, including, poetry,, new, age,, and, romance., Learn, more, about, Robin, and, her, work, by, visiting, http://www.watersnlight.com., 1., How, did, you, first, become, interested, in, practicing, Reiki?, The, most, fascinating,, empowering,, and, inspiring, element, leading, me, to, learn, the, practice, of, Reiki, was, its, beautiful,, healing, energy, that, works, as, well, for, treating, oneself,, once, attuned, to, it,, as, it, does, for, others., Because, of, some, major, auto-immune, problems,, I, was, gratified, to, find, something, I, could, implement, naturally, and, with, no, other, cost, after, the, class., This, means, I, now, have, direct, access, with, my, own, inner, power, to, bring, forth, at, will, for, pain, management, whenever, I, choose,, no, need, to, run, off, to, this, practitioner, or, that, doctor, with, every, ache, and, pain., Other, profound, benefits, are, spiritual, alignment, with, my, higher, self,, more, clarity, and, intuition,, less, anxiety, and, stress,, and, generally, a, calmer,, healthier, sense, of, well-being,, even, though, I, still, have, a, compromised, physical, being., My, initial, interest, blossomed, into, a, sincere, desire, to, become, a, Reiki, Master, Teacher, so, I, could, pass, on, this, ability, to, others., 2., What, do, you, see, as, the, connection, between, your, work, as, a, Marriage, and, Family, Therapist, and, your, work, as, a, Reiki, practitioner, and, an, author/publisher?, My, current, career,, a, blend, of, Reiki, and, writing/publishing, books,, arose, from, a, background, as, a, helper, in, the, healing, process., As, a, Marriage, and, Family, Therapist,, I, mostly, worked, with, children,, teens,, and, families., I, was, the, 0, to, 5, (California, First, Five), Program, Therapist, at, our, local, Mental, Health, Center., I, loved, working, with, families, and, their, young, children,, using, techniques, specifically, designed, to, enhance, attunement, in, relationships, between, the, child,, parents,, and, caregivers., Increased, brain, development, due, to, the, mirroring, of, feelings,, eye-contact,, healthy, touch,, and, audio, communication, of, talking,, reading,, and, singing, often, brought, much, joy,, closeness,, and,, sometimes,, parental, reunification., A, child’s, first, five, years, sets, up, an, entire, life, and, what, happens, during, those, years, will, directly, effect, that, individual, in, either, healthy, or, unhealthy, attachment, and, brain, development., To, be, part, of, positively, impacting, children, and, families, in, this, way, has, been, an, honor., Lucky, Lucky, the, Love, Puppy;, A, read-along,, sing-along,, feelings, picture, book, grew, from, this, work, at, Butte, County, Department, of, Behavioral, Health, in, Northern, California., Additionally,, I, was, a, play, therapist, working, individually, with, children,, and, I, would, at, times, create, my, own, materials., When, I, was, a, private, practice, intern,, my, supervisor,, Julie, Tamminga,, whom, I, met, at, my, first, therapist, job,, Children’s, Bureau, of, Southern, California,, immersed, me, in, Mindfulness, Training, via, Zen-inspired, Vypassana, Meditation,, a, technique, she, called, “Focused, Watching”,, a, way, to, observe, the, body, while, following, the, breath., Because, creators, frequently, use, what, they, know, to, write, or, explore, projects, that, interest, them,, I, wrote, a, children’s, story, to, help, children, identify, emotions, from, how, their, body, felt, inside, and, to, breathe, through, the, difficult, times, when, they, were, feeling, upset., It, also, touched, on, other, issues,, including, grief,, problem-solving,, compassionate, caring,, and, general, self-soothing., I, presented, the, story, to, Joyce, C., Mills,, MFC,, Ph.D.,, award-winning, therapy, storyteller,, and, Executive, Director, at, StoryPlay, Center,, Arizona,, at, a, workshop, of, hers, I, attended., I, was, fortunate, that, she, agreed, to, consult, and, provide, endorsement, for, the, book, for, ages, 7, to, 9, that, evolved, into, Mindful, Max, and, the, Mental, Magic, Club., Before, that,, earlier, in, my, career,, Julie, had, introduced, me, to, Reiki,, practicing, her, new, skills, on, me, as, I, was, beginning, to, show, signs, of, health, problems., But, it, wasn’t, until, many, years, later, when, a, massage, therapist, used, Reiki,, and, years, later, still,, when, an, alternative, health, NAET, practitioner,, Vickie, Van, Scyoc,, re-introduced, it, to, me, and, a, mutual, friend,, Casey, Fickardt-Hersch,, LCSW,, invited, me, to, attend, a, Reiki, One, Class, that, I, wanted, to, learn, it, for, myself., I, did, not, know, back, when, Julie, or, the, massage, therapist, provided, me, with, energy, healing,, that, if, one, learned, Reiki,, one, could, use, it, for, self-treatment., I, now, make, it, a, point, to, inform, people, that, we, all, are, healers, and, all, have, this, ability, within, us,, and, that, Reiki, is, easily, learned, and, accessed., The, next, writing, project, sprung, from, spirituality, and, a, psychologically, inspired, imagination:, a, novel, I’ve, been, writing,, revising,, and, pursuing, editing, for, many, years,, originally, called, Rich, with, Wonder,, but, now, titled,, Beaming, up, Rosie., The, story, revolves, around, a, quirky,, nearly, middle-aged, dentist,, Rosie, Rich,, who, has, managed, to, suppress, her, tumultuous, history,, but, is, dogged, by, a, fear, of, being, swallowed, up, in, a, pit, of, Hell, for, her, sins., She, meets, young,, cosmic, surfer-hunk,, Ken, Wonder,, and, catapults, onto, a, sexy,, roller-coaster, ride, of, metaphysical, New, Age, antics, and, synchronicities,, sending, her, into, a, tail-spin, of, emotional, and, spiritual, challenges,, as, she, desperately, seeks, redemption, while, encountering, this, odd,, sensual, conundrum, of, Mystical, Magic, Man, vs., Dangerous, Devil’s, Delighter,, alternate, dimensions,, and, layers, of, synchronicity, where, healers,, psychics,, mediums,, spirit, guides,, angels,, entities,, occultist, proponents, and, past, lives, confront, and, intertangle, with, her, present-day, human, dramas., I, plan, on, releasing, it, this, year,, 2017., Lucky, Lucky, the, Love, Puppy;, A, read-along,, sing-along,, feelings, picture, book,, is, the, last, book, I, wrote, and, the, first, one, I, published, once, I, decided, to, start, Waters, N, Light, Reiki, N, Books., For, ages, baby, to, six,, it, follows, Lucky,, my, true-life, Golden, Cocker, Spaniel,, as, he, emotes, various, feelings, through, doggy, behaviors., The, story, began, as, a, song, that, fell, from, my, lips, one, day, as, I, was, petting, him., Another, incidence, of, allowing, creativity, to, unfold, naturally,, I, grabbed, my, smart, phone, and, recorded, it,, knowing, instantly, it, would, be, my, next, book., I, wrote, the, song,, had, it, transcribed, and, put, to, piano, music, by, Gina, Trenalone,, then, professionally, recorded, it, at, Heirloom, Studios, in, Chico,, California., At, the, end, of, the, story/song,, I, present, questions, to, invite, discussion, with, teachers,, parents,, and, therapists, about, feelings., Obviously,, again,, it, was, inspired, from, connections, in, my, work, singing, and, reading, to, children, with, parents, for, the, above-mentioned, attunement, and, brain, development, process., I, am, super, proud, of, all, my, books,, but, this, one, is, the, most, fun, as, I, go, out, in, the, world, singing, and, flipping, pages, for, children, in, classrooms, and, libraries., The, kids, often, spontaneously, sing, the, catchy, first, part,, “Oh, Lucky, Lucky, the, Love, Puppy”., There, is, a, Spanish, version, in, the, works., Now, that, I’ve, moved, to, Hawaii,, I, seriously, plan, to, create, and, collaborate, on, Lucky, Lucky, Aloha, Puppy,, the, next, version, with, English, and, Hawaiian, translation., I, see, it, as, an, enjoyable,, interactive,, and, effective, way, to, introduce, children, to, emotional, education., Note:, In, addition, to, Amazon,, you, can, also, find, my, work, on, CDBaby., 3., What, inspired, you, to, start, writing, and, publishing, books?, As, you, can, see,, my, higher, self,, or, soul, if, you, will,, compels, me, to, write, entertaining, projects, with, substance, that, offer, healing, to, others,, whatever, age, they, may, be., Self-publishing, is, now, a, viable, way, for, authors, to, publish, with, many, established, authors, who’ve, landed, traditional, contracts, utilizing, self-publishing,, or, combining, modes, for, their, backlist., Thus,, Waters, N, Light, Reiki, N, Books, stemmed, from, a, sincere, desire, to, bring, my, brand, to, the, public, while, retaining, all, rights., However,, Beaming, up, Rosie,, may, branch, out, into, the, traditional, world, on, its, own, journey, to, self-realize., I, am, open, to, that, unfoldment, given, the, right, situation., 4., Do, you, have, an, intentional, goal, as, an, author, to, help, your, readers, in, some, way?, I, intend, to, weave, meaningful, emotional, and/or, spiritual, insight, into, each, book, without, preaching, or, lecturing., I, strive, to, make, the, reading, experience, one, that, is, engaging,, mesmerizing,, and,, perhaps,, thought-provoking., To, this, extent,, I, envision, a, non-fiction, series, of, miraculous, phenomenal, events, as, reported, by, healers, of, all, kinds, in, the, Sublime, Healers, 300, Series., 5., What, else, would, you, like, people, reading, this, interview, to, know, about, you, and, your, work?, I, consider, it, an, honor, and, a, privilege, to, teach,, write,, and,
