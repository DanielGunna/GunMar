[Film, Music, Jerry, Goldsmith, Planet, Of, The, Apes/Escape, From, The, Planet, Of, The, Apes, (Varèse, Sarabande, VSD-5848, CD), Here,, for, the, first, time,, is, the, complete, original, soundtrack, to, Franklin, Schaffner's, Planet, Of, The, Apes, (1968),, composed/conducted, by, Jerry, Goldsmith., If, the, movie, isn't, to, your, liking, (though, in, some, quarters, this, allegory, of, apes,, starring, Charlton, Heston,, is, regarded, as, a, sci-fi, classic), then, this, is, no, reason, not, to, be, gripped, by, a, stunning, score., One, of, the, film, industry's, most, prolific, and, critically, acclaimed, composers,, Goldsmith, (born, Los, Angeles,, 1929), must, have, written, for, every, genre, by, now,, yet, Planet, Of, The, Apes, remains, his, most, unorthodox,, formally, inventive, score, to, date., Responding, to, the, film's, peculiar, characterisation,, bleak, futuristic, setting, and, pacy, action, sequences,, the, score, persists, in, defiant, dissonance, to, the, point, where, occasional, tonality, is, almost, shocking., The, key, to, its, success, is, a, capacity, to, evoke, a, distinctive, soundworld, by, an, adventurous, use, of, orchestral, colour, and, texture,, emanating, from, unusual, instrumental, ingredients, such, as, metal, sheets, and, mixing, bowls,, wood, blocks, and, small, percussives, (some, echoplexed),, ram's, horn, and, Brazilian, cuica,, plus, carefully, deployed, harp,, xylophone, and, snare, drum., The, results, are, sometimes, reminiscent, of, Varèse, (e.g., Hyperprism)., Eschewing, elaborate, themes,, Goldsmith, uses, motivic, fragments, like, the, serial, phrase, played, by, ethereal, flute, or, high, strings,, the, running, piano, figures,, and, the, parched, cry, of, the, ram's, horn., A, major, film, score, of, great, character, and, originality,, marred, only, by, less, than, crystal, clear, recording, quality., Indispensable., If, Planet, Of, The, Apes, shows, Goldsmith's, understanding, of, avant-garde, scoring,, previously, unavailable, Escape, From, The, Planet, Of, The, Apes, (1971),, (third, film, in, the, series;, Leonard, Rosenman, scored, the, second),, reveals, a, competence, at, bringing, rock, instrumentation, into, an, orchestral, context., Bass, guitar, provides, the, rocky, rhythmic, drive, to, a, thematic, score, (echoes, of, John, Barry),, while, twangy, electric, guitar,, sitar,, organ,, and, especially, inventive, xylophone, supply, memorable, splashes, of, chromatic, colour., (Chris, Blackford), Leonard, Rosenman, East, Of, Eden/Rebel, Without, A, Cause, (Nonesuch, Film, Series, 7559-79402-2, CD), Two, new, recordings, of, Leonard, Rosenman's, (born, Brooklyn,, USA, 1924), better, known, scores, performed, by, the, London, Sinfonietta,, conducted, by, the, US, composer, John, Adams., Rosenman's, classical, training, (his, teachers, include, Arnold, Schoenberg,, Roger, Sessions, and, Luigi, Dallapiccola), pervades, his, work, for, films,, in, which, he's, never, been, afraid, to, incorporate, avant-garde, methods;, he's, also, pursued, a, parallel, career, writing, for, the, concert, hall., Encouraged, by, Leonard, Bernstein, and, Aaron, Copland, to, take, up, composing, for, films,, Rosenman's, first, project, was, Elia, Kazan's, East, Of, Eden, (1955),, now, largely, remembered, for, James, Dean's, impressive, screen, debut., At, its, most, reassuring, in, the, gentle,, folk-like, main, theme,, the, score, is, often, reminiscent, of, Copland's, pastoral, style,, as, displayed, to, charming, effect, in, his, score, for, Sam, Wood's, film, Our, Town, (1940)., Rosenman's, spacious,, translucent, strings, are, also, Coplandesque,, but, he, reveals, his, own, voice, in, many, subtle, and, succinct, thematic, variations, where, the, melodic, writing, becomes, darker, and, more, ambivalent,, most, notably, in, 'Fog, Scene', and, 'Bedroom, Window'., Adams, mostly, obtains, a, sensitive,, light, touch, from, the, Sinfonietta,, though, they, deliver, an, effectively, rugged, punch, on, the, rhythmically, vigorous, cue, 'Cal, And, Aron, Visit, Mother'., From, the, rural, pre-20s, to, 1950s, middle-class, suburbia, for, Rosenman's, second, film, score,, Rebel, Without, A, Cause, (1955)., You'd, be, forgiven, for, having, paid, more, attention, to, James, Dean's, legendary, performance, as, the, misunderstood, proto-teenager,, ably, supported, by, an, equally, troubled, Natalie, Wood., In, the, cinema,, jazz, was, still, synonymous, with, disaffected, youth, (but, rock, 'n', roll, was, fast, approaching),, so, for, Rebel, Rosenman, skilfully, combines, it, with, concert, hall, modernism,, achieving, a, kind, of, third, stream, amalgam, -, one, that, had, earlier, fascinated, Stravinsky, (Ebony, Concerto),, Milhaud, (La, création, du, monde), and, Copland, (Piano, Concerto)., His, only, concession, to, 50s, melodrama, is, a, splendid,, tender, love, theme,, given, a, lush, reading, topped, with, muted, trumpets, in, the, 'Main, Title'., Stratospheric, strings, and, wood-winds, connote, humankind's, existential, insignificance, in, 'The, Planetarium',, while, in, 'Knife, Fight', jazz, rhythms, collide, with, spiky, Stravinskyesque, rhythms,, and, 'The, Hunt', abounds, in, angular, writing, for, brass,, wood-winds, and, percussion., Sadly,, much, of, the, score's, power, was, reduced, because, of, dialogue, and, environmental, sounds,, but, Adams, and, the, Sinfonietta, have, done, a, great, job, in, restoring, all, of, its, marvellous,, sharply, accented, energy., (Chris, Blackford), René, Lussier, Chronicle, Of, A, Genocide, Foretold, (Ambiances, Magnétiques, AM, 058, CD), "Fifty, years, after, the, Holocaust,", the, sleevenotes, declare,, "the, world, allowed, another, genocide, to, occur,, this, time, in, Rwanda.", Eyewitnesses, (the, youngest, seven, years, of, age), recall, the, horrific, events., A, million, people, massacred, in, just, three, months, by, Hutu, extremists,, many, hacked, to, death, with, machetes., René, Lussier's, soundtrack, to, Danièle, Lacourse's, and, Yvan, Patry's, documentary, is, for, an, eight-piece, ensemble, (with, Lussier, are, Jean, Derome,, Pierre, Tanguay,, Céline, Arcand,, Robert, Marcel, Lepage,, Tom, Walsh,, Jean, René,, Vincent, Bernard),, plus, atmospheric, environmental, sounds., Abstract, improv, and, sombre, themes, are, thoughtfully, integrated:, the, former, touching, the, raw, nerve, of, ineradicable, trauma., Undoubtedly, a, difficult, commission,, but, René, Lussier's, response, is, a, work, of, admirable, sensitivity, and, intelligence., (Chris, Blackford), Popol, Vuh, Best, Of, Popol, Vuh, -, From, The, Films, Of, Werner, Herzog, (Milan, 73138, 35639-2, CD), The, many, collaborations, between, German, composer, Florian, Fricke, (with, his, group, Popol, Vuh), and, fellow, countryman,, film-maker, Werner, Herzog,, are, almost, unique, in, the, cinema, of, recent, decades:, conjure, up, the, exotic, landscapes, of, the, latter's, epic, feature, films, and, you, start, to, hear, the, former's, music, (perhaps, the, Nyman-Greenaway, collaborations, are, the, only, other, in, recent, times, to, have, attained, a, similar, level, of, music-image, symbiosis)., Yes,, Fricke, and, Herzog, speak, the, same, expressionistic, language,, often, cloaked, in, Stimmung, -, that, special, Teutonic, mood, described, by, film, historian, Lotte, Eisner, as, "a, mystical, and, singular, harmony, amid, the, chaos, of, things,, a, kind, of, sorrowful, nostalgia, mixed, with, well-being, languor, coloured, with, desire,, lust, of, body, and, soul.", (The, Haunted, Screen), Three, pieces, from, Nosferatu, (1979), and, Fitzcarraldo, (1982),, two, from, Cobra, Verde, (1988), and, one, each, from, Gasherbrum, (1985), and, Aguirre,, Wrath, Of, God, (1972)., All, are, grandiose, in, conception,, atmospherically, counterbalancing, choral, arrangements, (shades, of, Carl, Orff), with, the, lyrical, folk-rock, of, Popol, Vuh., 'A, Different, World', (from, Cobra, Verde), is, sumptuous,, dreamy, adagio, strings,, suffused, with, that, "sorrowful, nostalgia";, 'Brothers, Of, Darkness', (from, Nosferatu), evokes, ancient,, supernatural, malevolence, tinged, with, irreconcilable, despair., Florian, Fricke's, film, music, is, as, memorable, and, as, distinctive, as, the, work, of, Morricone, and, Rota., It's, time, he, reached, an, audience, beyond, the, realm, of, Krautrock, diehards., (Chris, Blackford), Peter, Hammill, Sonix, (Fie!, FIE, 9114, CD), The, CD, reissue, of, Loops, &, Reels, (Fie!), in, 1993, served, as, a, reminder, (to, those, who, needed, reminding), that, Peter, Hammill's, compositional, talents, stretch, beyond, songcraft, into, studio, tapework., Sonix,, a, similar, collection, (1994-96),, includes, film, and, dance, commissions., Four, soundtrack, excerpts, from, Michel, Spinosa's, Emmene-moi, typify, Hammill's, distinctive, feel, for, brooding,, bittersweet, melodies,, encapsulated, here, by, the, violin, and, viola, of, Stuart, Gordon., Hammill, describes, the, film, as, a, "dark, and, stressful, tale",, and, the, pieces, all, work, splendidly, as, mood, miniatures, without, the, visuals., Elsewhere,, 'Dark, Matter', (parts, of, which, were, used, in, the, Wolf, And, Water, film, of, Macbeth), manipulates, PH's, free, electric, guitar, playing,, compressing, it, into, a, narrow, dynamic, band, -, interestingly, recorded, at, a, level, lower, than, the, ferocity, of, the, playing, would, normally, suggest., 'Four, To, The, Floor', suffuses, relentless, pulse, with, peripheral, voices, and, subtle, distortions,, while, 'Exercise, For, Louis', evokes, an, eerie, processional, mood., Less, appealing,, without, the, dance, troupe,, that, is,, is, the, lengthy, (26, mins), 'Labyrinthine, Dreams',, where, fragile, thematic, material, (a, gentle, play, of, cadences), is, overstretched,, and, interspersed, by, polyrhythmic,, MIDI, piano, player, sections, too, obviously, in, the, manner, of, Nancarrow, and, Reich., Even, the, brief, 'song', sections, seem, laboured., Still,, it's, a, stimulating, and, revealing, collection,, and, Hammill, does, exceptionally, well, to, bring, an, overall, album-cohesion, to, the, disparate, strands, of, his, instrumental, work., (Chris, Blackford), Tibor, Szemzö, Relative, Things:, Selected, Soundscapes, 1994-97, (Leo, CD, LR, 250, CD), The, music, of, Hungarian, composer, Tibor, Szemzö, is, among, the, most, bewitching, in, the, Leo, Records, catalogue, (check, out, his, text-based, pieces, on, The, Conscience)., Stylistically, elusive,, Szemzö, is, among, the, finest, genre-benders, in, contemporary, composition,, and, this, selection, of, his, film, music, is, no, exception., Sadly,, there, is, no, information, (beyond, titles, and, directors), about, the, films, which, presumably, inspired, this, music., Notwithstanding, this, irritation,, I've, listened, to, Relative, Things, numerous, times, and, continue, to, be, fascinated, by, its, understated, haunting, qualities., Most, pieces, demonstrate, Szemzö's, uncanny, knack, of, making, quite, a, lot, happen, in, a, leisurely, manner., Or,, put, another, way,, there's, usually, more, going, on, here, than, first, meets, the, ear., Or,, some, sounds, happen, quickly, while, others, are, moving, very, slowly., The, effect, is, hypnotic, and, a, not, a, little, disorientating., For, 'Parijs', a, racing, clarinet, motif, is, counter-balanced, by, spartan, piano, and, lush, string, drones,, not, forgetting, that, seemingly, unrelated, hand-drumming., Two, textual, pieces, ('Anguish', probably, coming, from, a, documentary), speak, of, Chinese, human, rights, abuse, and, materialistic, man, as, a, "broken, being"., Elsewhere,, the, fluid, ethnic, rhythms, of, '&, Ground', recall, Hassell's, Fourth, World, hybrid,, and, the, meditative, beauty, of, 'The, Easy, One', typifies, Szemzö's, stunning, use, of, simple, chamber, gestures, to, achieve, profound, expressive, results., (Chris, Blackford), Lalo, Schifrin, Dirty, Harry, Anthology, (Aleph, Records, 003, CD), Hard, to, believe, that, such, a, well, known, soundtrack, like, Dirty, Harry, (1971), has, never, been, issued, in, its, entirety., Dirty, Harry, Anthology, (1998), contains, five, previously, unreleased, cues,, two, others, are, available, on, compilations,, leaving, one, last, cue,, 'Scorpio's, View',, still, unissued., Several, from, Magnum, Force, (1973), and, Sudden, Impact, (1989), also, make, their, release, debut, here., These, reasons, alone, make, this, collection, an, essential, purchase, for, both, Harry, and, Lalo, Schifrin, aficionados., Whether, or, not, one, approves, of, Clint's, trigger-happy,, macho, maverick, cop,, one, has, to, admit, that, Schifrin's, music, for, this, series, really, kicks, ass, on, both, physical, and, intellectual, levels., Plenty, of, punchy, jazz-rock, energy, (on, piledriving,, fuzzed, bass, guitar), for, those, adrenalin-soaked, action, sequences,, plus, many, instances, of, intricate,, atonal, orchestral, scoring, (don't, forget, that, Schifrin, was, a, pupil, of, Messiaen), to, convey, the, psychopathic, tensions, in, the, urban, landscape., Uncoupled, from, their, visual, referents,, the, latter, stand, out, as, imaginative, musical, miniatures,, not, merely, weird, sound, effects, strung, together., Notable, examples, are, 'Scorpio's, Theme',, 'Hot, Shot, Cop',, 'Floodlights', and, 'Good-bye, Cop', with, their, febrile, pizzicato,, nerve-jangling, glissandos,, ethereal, female, voices,, abrupt, changes, in, tempo, and, texture,, and, dissonant, almost, free, jazz, reeds., In, 'The, Mayor', (Dirty, Harry),, one, of, Schifrin's, most, evocative, and, surprising, arrangements,, the, melancholy, melody, on, electric, piano, is, accompanied, by, high-pitch,, raspy,, tremulous, strings., Don't, be, deterred, by, the, crass, aspects, of, these, movies, -, there's, some, remarkable, music, here, that, deserves, serious, attention., (Chris, Blackford), Lech, Jankowski, Institute, Benjamenta, (Koninck, CD01, CD), Here's, a, case, where, a, film, (see, video, reviews), took, some, of, its, cues, from, the, music, which, preceded, it, -, a, favoured, mode, of, collaboration, between, the, Brothers, Quay, and, Polish, composer, and, guitarist, Lech, Jankowski., Like, Cooder's, Paris, Texas,, Jankowski, conveys, a, palpable, sense, of, time,, space, and, silence., His, small, chamber, forces, are, manoeuvred, with, great, subtlety, and, precision, -, (Keith), Tippettesque, piano,, muted, trumpet, and, plangent, cello, the, most, poignant, of, its, voices., Unpredictable, extended, playing, techniques, and, grainy, improvisation, upset, the, delicate, balance, of, a, recurring, waltz,, while, playful, touches, and, exotic, timbres, bring, to, mind, Satie, and, Partch., Good, sleevenotes,, too., (Chris, Blackford),  ,  ,  , John, Zorn, Filmworks, III, (1990-95), (Tzadik, 7309, CD), Currently, running, to, eight, volumes,, John, Zorn's, Filmworks, series, aims, to, present,, in, rough, chronology,, all, of, his, compositions, for, film., For, a, man, known, sometimes, to, consume, up, to, four, movies, per, day,, involvement, with, film, music, would, seem, a, natural, step., Keeping, pace, with, his, multi-faceted, work, is, an, increasingly, costly, affair,, so, any, listener, happy, enough, to, settle, for, occasional, snapshots, should, find, Filmworks, III, an, ideal, point, of, entry, to, this, particular, strand., Of, principal, interest, to, most, will, be, the, debut, recordings, by, what, later, became, the, Masada, Quartet., On, the, soundtrack, to, The, Thieves,, they, can, be, heard, playing, noirish, jazz,, an, open, homage, to, Miles, Davis', work, for, Louis, Malle's, Lift, To, The, Scaffold., Zorn, is, not,, however,, engaged, in, pastiche,, adding, trademark, alto, sax, screams,, a, quirky, recording, debut, as, a, pianist, and, a, cameo, for, Robert, Quine's, noisy, surf, guitar, to, the, mix., This, must, have, been, some, film!, Many, tracks, appear, fragmentary, and, underdeveloped,, making, an, awareness, of, the, functionality, of, music, in, cinema, helpful., Rounding, out, the, volume, are, the, original, genre-hopping, and, jump-cutting, cues, from, the, Japanese, cartoon, Cynical, Hysterie, Hour,, a, delightful, duet, (Hollywood, Hotel), with, Marc, Ribot,, and, 30, one-minute, miniatures, for, Weiden, &, Kennedy, TV, commercials, directed, by, such, luminaries, as, Godard,, Cronenberg, and, Nykvist., Whatever, the, situational, challenge,, Zorn, tackles, it, with, aplomb,, leaving, an, inimitable, thumb-print, on, the, work., (Fred, Grand),  , Bernard, Herrmann, Vertigo, (Varese, Sarabande, VSD-5600,, 1995, CD), Psycho, (Varese, Sarabande, VSD-5765,, 1996, CD), Bernard, Herrmann's, (1911-1976), refusal, to, compromise, was, legendary,, but, produced, some, highly, individual, scores,, particularly, for, Alfred, Hitchcock., Vertigo, (1958), and, Psycho, (1960), rank, among, the, composer's, finest, achievements., These, two, new, recordings, are, performed, by, the, estimable, Royal, Scottish, National, Orchestra,, conducted, by, Joel, McNeely,, also, a, film, composer., Sound, quality, is, superb,, close, miking, revealing, every, timbral, nuance, of, these, sumptuous, orchestrations., Since, disturbed,, obsessive, mentalities, fester, at, the, core, of, these, narratives,, Herrmann, was, able, to, bring, a, modernist, sensibility, to, both, scores, without, drawing, undue, attention, to, their, dissonant, elements;, the, notorious, shower, scene, ('The, Murder'), in, Psycho, being, an, obvious, exception, where, savage, atonal, writing, clearly, matches, the, visuals., However,, without, the, visuals, and, dialogue, one, can, fully, appreciate, the, detail, in, this, often, audacious, scoring., In, the, case, of, Vertigo, -, more, to, do, with, obsessive, desire, than, straightforward, love, -, any, dissonance, is, leavened, with, wistful, post-romanticism, of, a, Wagnerian, and, Mahlerian, stature,, attaining, its, first, peak, at, the, precise, moment, (the, editing, is, sublime), when, Scottie, and, Madeleine, avoid, eye, contact, in, a, restaurant, bar, ('Madeleine's, First, Appearance')., This, sub-cue, is, one, of, several, which, comprise, 'Scottie, Trails, Madeleine', and, is, followed, by, 'Carlotta's, Portrait'., Together,, these, cues, run, for, about, 15, minutes, in, which, time, barely, a, line, of, dialogue, is, spoken., In, a, typically, ambitious, sequence, -, we're, practically, watching, a, silent, film, at, this, stage, -, Hitchcock, allows, Herrmann's, music, to, subtly, build, tension, and, intrigue,, as, well, as, suggest, the, thoughts, of, Scottie, (James, Stewart), as, we, watch, him, following, Madeleine, (Kim, Novak), from, one, city, location, to, another,, and, so, the, narrative, mystery, deepens., But, before, all, of, this,, we're, treated, to, 'Prelude, And, Rooftop',, an, imposing, opener,, becoming, breathtakingly, more, agitated, to, reinforce, the, famous, vertiginous, sequence., This, is, the, first, complete, recording, of, Psycho;, its, 40, cues, run, for, just, over, an, hour., Herrmann, said, he, wanted, "to, complement, the, black-and-white, photography, of, the, film, with, a, black-and-white, score.", This, he, achieved, in, a, work, composed, for, strings-only, -, 50, of, them., Other, than, the, music, to, the, aforementioned, shower, scene, and, the, recurring, breathless, 'Prelude', theme,, the, remainder, of, the, score, is, less, well, known., It, may, surprise, you, to, discover, that, there's, not, much, hysteria, in, the, score, as, a, whole,, Herrmann, demonstrating, to, marvellous, effect, that, the, monstrous, can, be, conveyed, by, subtler, means., In, fact,, it's, a, score, of, great, emotional, sensitivity,, economy, (atmospherics, are, largely, based, on, brief, motifs, where, every, gesture, counts), and, timbral, subtlety;, not, what, one, would, expect, from, the, music, to, a, so-called, shocking, horror, movie., A, fascinating, cue, like, 'The, Peephole', reveals, the, subtlety, of, Herrmann's, writing., Here, Norman, Bates, (Anthony, Perkins), secretly, watches, Marion, Crane, (Janet, Leigh), undressing, in, what, she, presumes, is, the, privacy, of, her, hotel, room., The, piece, begins, with, an, almost, lyrical, lightness, suggesting, his, wonder, and, barely, controlled, sexual, excitement,, before, high-pitch,, searing, violins, (which, will, be, introduced, again, in, a, more, aggressive, manner, during, the, shower, scene), forewarn, us, of, a, darker, purpose, behind, this, voyeurism., Listen, to, this, score, a, few, times, without, the, visuals, and, then, return, to, the, film,, and, you'll, discover, a, different, kind, of, film, -, one, where, Herrmann's, sensitive, orchestrations, probe, the, often, overlooked, undercurrents, of, despair,, guilt,, sexual, repression, and, alienation, which, lurk, beneath, the, visual, suspense, and, horror., Paradoxically,, perhaps,, although, this, music, is, obviously, closely, tied, to, the, film,, the, more, one, hears, it, independently,, the, less, one, thinks, of, Psycho,, and, instead, perceives, it, first, and, foremost, as, a, stunning, exploration, of, multilayered, string, timbres, and, textures.,
