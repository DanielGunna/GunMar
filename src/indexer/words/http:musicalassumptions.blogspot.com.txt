interested, in, playing, it., The, number, of, people, who, have, looked, at, the, music, still, remains, at, zero, as, I, write:, so, I, cannot, attribute, lack, of, interest, in, the, piece, to, its, quality, or, playability., I, should, attribute, it, to, the, fact, that, the, people, who, might, like, to, know, about, it, don't, know, about, it., I, have, shared, the, link, to, the, listing, for, the, piece, in, my, thematic, catalog, on, Facebook,, but, my, Facebook, friends, are, far, more, interested, in, life, events, than, woodwind, quintets., Facebook, has, very, little, in, the, way, of, woodwind-quintet-related, group, activity., Most, of, the, groups, labeled, "woodwind, quintet", on, Facebook, seem, to, have, an, average, of, five, members,, and, sharing, my, new, piece, with, these, intimate, groups, of, people, I, don't, know, doesn't, seem, right., I, started, going, through, my, Thematic, Catalog, blog, to, check, on, the, viability, of, links, to, the, 77, pieces, that, I, have, published, by, Subito,, and, I, noticed, that, the, links, to, audio, files, that, I, thought, were, viable, are, no, longer, active., I, spent, the, past, couple, of, days, updating, links, to, audio, files, for, the, pieces, I, wrote, in, 2000,, 2001,, 2002,, and, some, of, 2003,, and, plan, to, spend, much, of, today, updating, more, links, to, audio, files, for, pieces, I, wrote, from, 2003, to, 2006., Going, through, all, this, music, has, been, interesting, for, me., It, is, a, chore, to, locate,, generate,, update,, upload,, and, organize, a, body, of, work,, but, I, still, really, like, the, pieces, in, my, catalog,, and, I, think, that, it, is, a, good, idea, to, promote, them., I, hope, that, some, of, the, pieces, I, have, neglected, (for, lack, of, working, links), find, their, way, to, musicians, who, are, looking, for, new, music, to, play., Posted, by, Elaine, Fine, at, 8:47, AM, No, comments:, Tuesday,, March, 28,, 2017, "In, Praise, of,

contemplating, the, "why", of, composition, lately., After, years, and, years, of, addressing, the, "why, not?", of, composing, music,, I, find, myself, at, an, interesting, point, of, pause., And, today,, after, a, rather, busy, few, months, spent, in, navigating, the, hows,, whys,, and, wherefores, of, music, written, by, other, people, (with, a, lot, of, emphasis, on, the, hows, lately),, I, realize, that, almost, every, piece, I, have, written, has, been, a, "working, out", of, something., I, suppose, that, I, have, always, thought, of, pieces, of, music, as, a, way, to, work, through, thoughts, and, work, out, ideas., Sometimes, those, thoughts, are, veiled, representations, of, people,, places,, stories,, and, characters., Sometimes, those, thoughts, involve, interaction, between, abstract, ideas, using, instrumental, voices., Sometimes, those, thoughts, involve, the, behavior, of, characters, in, history, or, fiction, that, do, their, interacting, without, words,, and, sometimes, those, characters, work, out, their, "stuff", with, the, help, of, a, text., I, used, to, think, that, everybody, who, wrote, music, did, this,, but, now, I, am, beginning, to, think, that, doing, this, might, be, a, family, trait., My, brother,, Marshall, Fine,, wrote, program, notes, for, his, music., In, those, program, notes, he, gives, explicit, details, of, how, he, wove, the, contradictions, and, concerns, in, his, personal, and, professional, life, into, the, music, he, wrote., His, Rock, Etudes, for, Solo, Viola,, for, example,, concern, specific, events, in, his, life, that, he, connected, with, particular, rock, songs, from, the, 1960s, and, 1970s., (You, can, read, the, notes, in, the, IMSLP, listing.), I, believe, that, he, used, a, logical, organization, of, things, musical, to, try, to, work, out, personal, frustrations, and, experiences, in, his, life, that, he, could, name, but, could, not, understand., Every, person, on, the, autism, spectrum, has, a, unique, set, of, challenges, that, make, interpreting, the, workings, of, the, world, difficult,, but, because, of, Marshall's, particular, make-up,, his, particular, "off-the-charts", set, of, musical, gifts,, his, outspoken, nature,, and, the, relatively, small, size, of, his, communities, (the, community, of, violists,, the, community, of, classical, musicians, in, Memphis, and, Branson),, he, loomed, large., He, certainly, always, loomed, large, in, my, world, (and, still, does)., Understanding, something, of, this, brother-sister, bond, through, our, shared, attitude, toward, creative, work, gives, me, strength., My, perception, of, the, world, is, (as, far, as, I, can, tell), that, of, a, "neuro-typical", person,, but, the, musical, "working, out", of, interactions, and, ideas, is, nevertheless, the, reason, that, I, like, to, write, music., The, Italian, violist, Daniele, Colombo's, recording, of, Marshall's, Rock, Etudes, will, be, coming, out, in, the, Solitudes, label, in, the, not-too-distant, future., Daniele, plays, them, spectacularly., Posted, by, Elaine, Fine, at, 7:08, PM, No, comments:, Tuesday,, March, 14,, 2017, Creative, Changes, I, guess, that, creative, outlets, change, from, time, to, time., For, years, and, years, I, put, a, great, deal, of, creative, energy, into, composition., I, found, a, crazy, fulfillment, from, writing., It, was, the, first, thing, I, wanted, to, do, when, I, woke, up, in, the, morning,, and, I, would, put, off, other, tasks, in, order, to, work, out, ideas., I, even, enjoyed, working, out, ideas, and, then, discarding, the, product., I, did, put, time, and, energy, into, trying, to, become, a, better, violist, and, a, better, interpretive, musician,, but, not, having, to, attend, to, the, physical, production, notes, on, an, instrument, in, real, time, is, a, great, "ladder, of, escape.", When, you, write, a, piece, of, music, it, is, usually, another, person's, responsibility, to, make, it, sound, good., It, is, also, another, person's, responsibility, to, determine, what, it, "means.", Lately, I, have, been, getting, intense, enjoyment, from, playing, old, notes, and, old, phrases, written, by, people, I, probably, never, would, have, met, had, I, been, alive, when, they, were, alive., I, really, get, a, kick, out, of, figuring, out, how, I, want, phrases, to, "go.", It, is, as, if, some, switch, has, been, turned., I, still, have, the, skill, to, write,, but, lately, I, prefer, to, devote, my, time, to, listening, more, carefully, and, becoming, a, better, player., The, music, running, through, my, head, these, days, is, mainly, music, written, by, other, people, (sometimes, it, is, music, that, I, am, arranging,, but, more, often, it, is, music, I, am, practicing)., And, I, feel, oddly, at, peace., I, sometimes, ask, myself, if, I, am, still, a, composer, when, I, am, not, in, the, process, of, writing, something., I, also, wonder, if, I, am, less, of, a, composer, because, I, tend, to, neglect, the, business-related, things, that, composers, have, to, do, in, order, to, have, my, music, played., The, answers, to, these, questions, don't, matter, at, all., It, is, simply, a, pleasure, and, an, honor, to, be, able, to, be, a, full, participant, in, musical, life,, even, when, it, is, physically, exhausting., I, can't, think, of, a, better, way, to, spend, my, days., Posted, by, Elaine, Fine, at, 8:19, PM, No, comments:, Monday,, February, 27,, 2017, Concert, of, Music, for, Viola, and, Piano, by, Women, John, David, Moore, and, I, play, two, concerts, a, year., One, has, music, written, by, women, and, one, has, music, written, by, men., We, can, honestly, say, that, we, play, as, much, music, written, by, women, as, we, do, music, written, by, men., Or, we, could, say, that, we, play, as, much, music, written, by, men, as, we, play, music, written, by, women., Our, program, for, this, March, has, two, transcriptions, and, two, pieces, originally, written, for, viola, and, piano., Mel, Bonis’s, Sonata, for, Cello, and, Piano, works, very, well, on, the, viola., I, believe, my, transcription,, which, I, just, uploaded, into, the, IMSLP,, is, the, first, viola, transcription, (though, I, would, be, very, happy, to, learn, that, I, am, not, alone, in, my, viola, adventure, with, the, piece)., The, original, was, published, in, 1905, with, a, dedication, to, Maurice, Demaison,, a, Paris, art, critic., Mel, (Mélanie), Bonis, (1858–1937), entered, the, Paris, Conservatory, at, the, age, of, sixteen,, where, she, studied, organ, with, César, Franck, and, Auguste, Bazille,, and, harmony, with, Ernest, Guiraud., Her, more, than, 300, works, include, nine, volumes, of, music, for, solo, piano, and, piano, four, hands,, music, for, organ,, vocal, music,, orchestral, music,, and, chamber, music., The, other, transcription, is, from, the, Dutch, composer, Henriette, Bosmans, (1895-1952),, considered, to, be, one, of, the, most, important, Dutch, composers, of, the, early, twentieth, century., Bosmans, wrote, her, Impressions, for, Cello, and, Piano, for, the, French, cellist, Gérard, Hekking,, the, principal, cellist, of, the, Concertgebouw, Orchestra, from, 1903, through, 1914., Like, much, of, her, cello, music,, these, pieces, were, written, for, the, upper, register, of, the, cello,, so, they, can,, for, the, most, part,, be, played, on, the, viola, in, the, intended, octave., The, rest, of, the, program, has, works, written, for, viola, and, piano, by, the, British, composers, Elizabeth, Maconchy, (1907-1994), and, Kalitha, Dorothy, Fox, (1894-1934)., Maconchy, spent, her, childhood, in, Ireland., She, studied, composition, with, Charles, Wood, and, Ralph, Vaughan, Williams, at, the, Royal, College, of, Music., Dame, Elizabeth, (thanks, Lisa), was, a, prolific, and, highly, decorated, composer., She, wrote, her, Viola, Sonata, in, 1937,, but, it, remained, unpublished, until, 2015., K., Dorothy, Fox, is, one, of, the, sixty-three, women, with, entries, in, Corbett’s, Cyclopedic, Survey, of, Chamber, Music,, and, was, a, member, of, the, Society, of, Women, Musicians, (SWM),, which, was, affiliated, with, the, Royal, College, of, Music., We, know, about, her, death, (a, suicide, reported, in, the, minutes, of, the, SWM),, but, nothing, of, her, life., Fox’s, Sonata, for, Viola, and, Piano, (which, is, in, the, IMSLP),, one, of, ten, pieces, in, her, catalog,, was, published, in, 1925, with, a, dedication, to, G.H.B., Fox., There, are, mentions, in, various, periodical, publications, of, a, G.H.B., Fox, who, played, chess, and, cricket,, but, it, is, unclear, whether, he, was, a, musician, or, how, he, may, have, been, related, to, the, composer., We, do, know, that, this, Sonata, was, once, broadcast, on, the, radio, from, Bournemouth,, and, that, it, was, part, of, a, concert, on, July, 12,, 1931, concert, celebrating, the, twentieth, anniversary, concert, of, the, SWM., That, concert, also, also, included, a, piece, by, Elizabeth, Maconchy., Posted, by, Elaine, Fine, at, 11:51, AM, 1, comment:, Saturday,, February, 11,, 2017, Thinking, About, Spring, Once, again, we, have, a, tease, of, spring, sandwiched, between, bouts, of, winter., Yesterday, we, were, putting, salt, on, the, ice, on, the, front, step, (so, that, the, mail, carrier, wouldn't, slip),, and, today,, with, the, thermometer, reading, 61, degrees,, I'm, wearing, a, summer, dress, and, am, tempted,, after, doing, some, hefty, practicing,, to, go, dig, in, the, spot, in, the, back, yard, that, will, be, our, garden, once, official, spring, arrives., Michael, and, I, finished, 1984, today,, and, I, found, a, reference, to, "Some, Thoughts, on, the, Common, Toad", in, the, introduction, (I, always, read, introductions, last)., I, thought, I, would, share, a, bit, of, it, here., As, for, spring,, not, even, the, narrow, and, gloomy, streets, round, the, Bank, of, England, are, quite, able, to, exclude, it., It, comes, seeping, in, everywhere,, like, one, of, those, new, poison, gases, which, pass, through, all, filters., The, spring, is, commonly, referred, to, as, ‘a, miracle’,, and, during, the, past, five, or, six, years, this, worn-out, figure, of, speech, has, taken, on, a, new, lease, of, life., After, the, sorts, of, winters, we, have, had, to, endure, recently,, the, spring, does, seem, miraculous,, because, it, has, become, gradually, harder, and, harder, to, believe, that, it, is, actually, going, to, happen., Every, February, since, 1940, I, have, found, myself, thinking, that, this, time, winter, is, going, to, be, permanent., But, Persephone,, like, the, toads,, always, rises, from, the, dead, at, about, the, same, moment., Suddenly,, towards, the, end, of, March,, the, miracle, happens, and, the, decaying, slum, in, which, I, live, is, transfigured., Down, in, the, square, the, sooty, privets, have, turned, bright, green,, the, leaves, are, thickening, on, the, chestnut, trees,, the, daffodils, are, out,, the, wallflowers, are, budding,, the, policeman's, tunic, looks, positively, a, pleasant, shade, of, blue,, the, fishmonger, greets, his, customers, with, a, smile,, and, even, the, sparrows, are, quite, a, different, color,, having, felt, the, balminess, of, the, air, and, nerved, themselves, to, take, a, bath,, their, first, since, last, September., Is, it, wicked, to, take, a, pleasure, in, spring, and, other, seasonal, changes?, To, put, it, more, precisely,, is, it, politically, reprehensible,, while, we, are, all, groaning,, or, at, any, rate, ought, to, be, groaning,, under, the, shackles, of, the, capitalist, system,, to, point, out, that, life, is, frequently, more, worth, living, because, of, a, blackbird's, song,, a, yellow, elm, tree, in, October,, or, some, other, natural, phenomenon, which, does, not, cost, money, and, does, not, have, what, the, editors, of, left-wing, newspapers, call, a, class, angle?, There, is, not, doubt, that, many, people, think, so., I, know, by, experience, that, a, favourable, reference, to, ‘Nature’, in, one, of, my, articles, is, liable, to, bring, me, abusive, letters,, and, though, the, key-word, in, these, letters, is, usually, ‘sentimental’,, two, ideas, seem, to, be, mixed, up, in, them., One, is, that, any, pleasure, in, the, actual, process, of, life, encourages, a, sort, of, political, quietism., People,, so, the, thought, runs,, ought, to, be, discontented,, and, it, is, our, job, to, multiply, our, wants, and, not, simply, to, increase, our, enjoyment, of, the, things, we, have, already., The, other, idea, is, that, this, is, the, age, of, machines, and, that, to, dislike, the, machine,, or, even, to, want, to, limit, its, domination,, is, backward-looking,, reactionary, and, slightly, ridiculous., This, is, often, backed, up, by, the, statement, that, a, love, of, Nature, is, a, foible, of, urbanized, people, who, have, no, notion, what, Nature, is, really, like., Those, who, really, have, to, deal, with, the, soil,, so, it, is, argued,, do, not, love, the, soil,, and, do, not, take, the, faintest, interest, in, birds, or, flowers,, except, from, a, strictly, utilitarian, point, of, view., To, love, the, country, one, must, live, in, the, town,, merely, taking, an, occasional, week-end, ramble, at, the, warmer, times, of, year., This, last, idea, is, demonstrably, false., Medieval, literature,, for, instance,, including, the, popular, ballads,, is, full, of, an, almost, Georgian, enthusiasm, for, Nature,, and, the, art, of, agricultural, peoples, such, as, the, Chinese, and, Japanese, centre, always, round, trees,, birds,, flowers,, rivers,, mountains., The, other, idea, seems, to, me, to, be, wrong, in, a, subtler, way., Certainly, we, ought, to, be, discontented,, we, ought, not, simply, to, find, out, ways, of, making, the, best, of, a, bad, job,, and, yet, if, we, kill, all, pleasure, in, the, actual, process, of, life,, what, sort, of, future, are, we, preparing, for, ourselves?, If, a, man, cannot, enjoy, the, return, of, spring,, why, should, he, be, happy, in, a, labour-saving, Utopia?, What, will, he, do, with, the, leisure, that, the, machine, will, give, him?, I, have, always, suspected, that, if, our, economic, and, political, problems, are, ever, really, solved,, life, will, become, simpler, instead, of, more, complex,, and, that, the, sort, of, pleasure, one, gets, from, finding, the, first, primrose, will, loom, larger, than, the, sort, of, pleasure, one, gets, from, eating, an, ice, to, the, tune, of, a, Wurlitzer., I, think, that, by, retaining, one's, childhood, love, of, such, things, as, trees,, fishes,, butterflies, and, —, to, return, to, my, first, instance, —, toads,, one, makes, a, peaceful, and, decent, future, a, little, more, probable,, and, that, by, preaching, the, doctrine, that, nothing, is, to, be, admired, except, steel, and, concrete,, one, merely, makes, it, a, little, surer, that, human, beings, will, have, no, outlet, for, their, surplus, energy, except, in, hatred, and, leader, worship., At, any, rate,, spring, is, here,, even, in, London, N., 1,, and, they, can't, stop, you, enjoying, it., This, is, a, satisfying, reflection., How, many, a, time, have, I, stood, watching, the, toads, mating,, or, a, pair, of, hares, having, a, boxing, match, in, the, young, corn,, and, thought, of, all, the, important, persons, who, would, stop, me, enjoying, this, if, they, could., But, luckily, they, can't., So, long, as, you, are, not, actually, ill,, hungry,, frightened, or, immured, in, a, prison, or, a, holiday, camp,, spring, is, still, spring., The, atom, bombs, are, piling, up, in, the, factories,, the, police, are, prowling, through, the, cities,, the, lies, are, streaming, from, the, loudspeakers,, but, the, earth, is, still, going, round, the, sun,, and, neither, the, dictators, nor, the, bureaucrats,, deeply, as, they, disapprove, of, the, process,, are, able, to, prevent, it., Posted, by, Elaine, Fine, at, 2:49, PM, 1, comment:, Tuesday,, January, 31,, 2017, Haydn, Quartet, Project, After, this, past, year's, Summer, Strings, came, to, a, close,, some, adult, members, of, the, ensemble, thought, it, might, be, a, nice, idea, to, play, some, chamber, music, together, during, the, other, seasons, of, the, year,, and, to, play, it, in, the, dining, room, of, the, assisted, living, facility, where, the, violist, lives., This, violist,, who, was, my, stand-partner, in, orchestra, for, many, years,, suffers, from, early-onset, Alzheimer's, disease., She, has, difficulty, with, practical, life, issues,, but, when, the, viola, is, in, her, hands, she, plays, beautifully., The, cellist, is, a, late, starter, who, never, played, in, a, string, quartet, before,, and, the, second, violinist, is, a, retired, teacher, who,, though, she, has, been, a, life-long, amateur,, also, never, played, in, a, string, quartet, before., And, I'm, playing, the, first, violin, part,, which, is, a, novel, position, for, me, since, I, usually, play, viola, in, string, quartets., I, suggested, that, we, play, through, all, the, Haydn, quartets, in, order,, beginning, with, Opus, 1., We, meet, once, every, two, weeks, or, so,, read, the, designated, quartet, through,, work, on, trouble, spots,, and, then, read, it, through, again., We, have, an, appreciative, audience, of, residents, who, keep, coming, back., The, quartet, novices, get, better, every, time, we, meet,, and, I, keep, surprising, myself, by, actually, doing, what, a, first, violinist, in, a, string, quartet, needs, to, do., Tonight, we, played, Opus, 2,, Number, 2, in, E, major., While, we, were, playing, I, thought, about, the, generations, upon, generations, of, people, all, over, the, world, who, have, played, these, quartets,, which, were, written, in, 1775,, while, living, under, all, sorts, of, less-than-ideal, systems, of, government., The, people, playing, these, quartets, might, have, had, the, same, psychic, need, for, escape, that, my, colleagues, and, I, had, this, evening., I, don't, know, what, the, future, holds, for, the, country, and, the, world,, but, I, do, know, that, next, time, we, will, play, Opus, 2,, Number,

also, learned, that, someone, who, studies, time, is, called, an, Horologist,, and, the, study, of, time, is, Horology., I, have, always, been, amazed, that, we,, as, human, beings,, have, the, ability, to, divide, beats, into, 2,, 3,, 4,, 5,, 6,, 7,, 8,, 9,, 10,, 11,, 12,, 13,, 14,, 16,, and, even, 15, parts, with, enough, accuracy, to, sing, or, play, in, unison, with, others., This, article, (and, podcast), doesn't, explain, that, phenomenon,, but, it, at, least, provokes, me, to, think, about, it., And, then, there's, The, Pajama, Game., With, music's, most, famous, Horologist!, And,, of, course,, Messiaen's, Quartet, for, the, end, of, Time:, Posted, by, Elaine, Fine, at, 12:03, PM, No, comments:, Sunday,, January, 08,, 2017, Offbeat, Afterthoughts, Last, night,, at, the, age, of, 57,, I, played, my, very, first, orchestral, New, Year's, concert., The, inspiration, for, most, orchestral, New, Year's, concerts, is, that, of, Willy, Boskovsky, and, the, Vienna, Philharmonic,, and, there, are, usually, Strauss, Waltzes, on, the, program., I, have, played, quartet, transcriptions, of, Strauss, Waltzes,, but, last, night, was, the, first, time, I, ever, played, the, viola, part, of, a, true, Viennese, waltz, as, nature, intended, (as, originally, orchestrated)., At, the, first, rehearsal, my, stand, partner, told, me, that, one, of, her, past, orchestras, devoted, a, whole, year, to, playing, Viennese, music, of, all, stripes,, and, the, conductor, was, very, meticulous, about, the, way, he, wanted, the, after, beats, to, fall., In, Viennese, fashion, the, second, beat, of, the, three-quarter-time, measure, falls, a, fraction, of, a, bit, sooner, than, it, would, fall, when, playing, the, second, beat, in, a, non-Viennese, waltzes., I, had, ample, opportunity, to, experiment,, and, I, found, that, if, I, simply, let, my, bow, drop, to, the, string, from, above, on, the, first, of, the, after, beats,, and, then, allowed, the, second, after, beat, to, rebound, gently, on, the, up-bow, stroke,, I, could, get, that, lilting, feeling, that, I, understand, to, be, stylistically, appropriate., Since, a, mixture, of, gravity, and, Gemütlichkeit, was, at, play,, it, seemed, to, require, no, effort., No, effort, is, good, when, your, evening, is, populated, mostly, by, off, beats., Another, day,, another, off-beat., This, morning, I, played, a, bunch, of, waltzes, arranged, for, string, quartet., One, was, Viennese,, but, most, of, the, pieces, in, three-quarter, time, were, not., I, tried, my, dropping, bow, technique, on, the, Strauss,, and, it, worked, nicely., Then, I, tried, the, dropping, bow, technique, on, some, non-Viennese, waltzes,, and, it, made, them, feel, mannered, and, awkward., Posted, by, Elaine, Fine, at, 7:23, PM, No, comments:, Friday,, January, 06,, 2017, Musical, Life, and, Loss, The, loss, of, a, musician, who,, due, to, age,, has, exhausted, his, or, her, productivity, is, still, a, profound, loss, because, a, direct, link, to, a, tradition, has, been, severed., I, accept, death, as, a, natural, ending, to, life., When, someone, lives, out, their, full, lifespan,, that, life, is, something, to, be, celebrated,, and, the, works, and, deeds, that, a, person, accomplished, and, shared, should, always, be, cherished, as, pieces, of, their, best, selves., I, feel, that, with, my, mother's, art, that, hangs, on, my, walls., But, there, is, a, personal, connection, that, can't, be, seen,, and, can't, truly, be, felt, only, through, a, person's, works., (Usually, words, come, easily, to, me,, but, now, they, don't.), It, has, taken, a, while, for, me, to, truly, accept, Bernie, Zaslav's, death., I, know, that, his, body, was, failing., I, know, that, he, put, in, a, good, 90, years,, and, spent, the, last, several, months, in, physical, discomfort., I, know, that, he, was, ready, to, go,, and, that, he, was, proud, of, what, he, accomplished, during, his, life, and, his, career, as, a, musician., Now, I, think, of, Bernie, every, time, I, play, string, quartets., And, I, believe, that, is, the, "place", he, would, have, liked, to, be, best, remembered., In, string, quartets, all, over, the, world., There, he, is,, mingled, in, with, the, Haydn., Celebrating, sequences., Embracing, dissonance,, and, rejoicing, in, resolution., Now, it's, time, to, play, some, scales,, while, I, look, forward, to, playing, quartets, on, Sunday, ., ., ., Posted, by, Elaine, Fine, at, 9:01, AM, No, comments:, Thursday,, December, 29,, 2016, Bernard, Zaslav:, A, Special, Violist, in, My, Life, Bernard, Zaslav,, who, was, born, in, 1926,, died, yesterday, afternoon, at, the, age, of, 90., He, holds, a, very, special, and, a, very, permanent, place, in, my, heart., I, got, to, know, Bernie, extremely, well,, first, through, his, recordings,, then, through, the, internet, viola, list,, and, later, while, working, with, him, on, his, memoir,, The, Viola, in, My, Life:, An, Alto, Rhapsody., Shortly, after, I, began, working, with, Bernie, on, his, book, I, began, to, wonder, if, he, might, know, my, friend, Seymour, Barab,, who, was, active, in, New, York, at, the, same, time., I, casually, asked, Seymour, if, he, knew, Bernie,, and, Seymour, got, very, excited., He, told, me, that, they, were, in, a, string, quartet, together, during, the, 1960s,, and, that, they, hadn't, been, in, touch, for, 50, years, (Bernie, left, New, York, for, Milwaukee, in, 1968, to, play, with, the, Fine, Arts, Quartet,, and, Seymour, remained, in, New, York, for, the, rest, of, his, life)., I, gave, each, the, other's, phone, number,, and, they, renewed, their, friendship., Seymour, read, through, a, draft, of, Bernie's, memoir, and, made, many, excellent, suggestions., (Michael, enjoyed, Seymour's, comments, so, much, that, he, used, to, show, pages, of, Seymour's, editing, to, his, college, students.), I, have, written, a, lot, on, this, blog, about, Bernie., He, was, a, remarkable, man, who,, through, his, playing,, his, wit,, and, his, kindness,, brightened, American, musical, life, for, much, of, the, 20th, century, from, sea, to, shining, sea, (peppered, with, many, concert, tours, abroad)., You, can, find, the, posts, I, have, written, about, him, here,, and, you, can, get, a, copy, of, his, memoir, from, Amazon,, where, he, tells, true, tales, about, the, marvelous, musical, world, of, the, 20th, century, from, the, standpoint, of, one, of, its, brilliant, inner, voices., The, book, comes, with, two, CDs, that, give, a, musical,
