animation,, 3D,, CGI,, and, FX, Industries,  ,  , The, History, of, Animation:, Advantages, and, Disadvantages, of, the, Studio, System, in, the, Production, of, an, Art, Form, (by, Michael, Crandol), "Animation, should, be, an, art....what, you, fellows, have, done, with, it, is, making, it, into, a, trade....not, an, art,, but, a, trade....bad, luck, .", Thus, Winsor, McCay,, father, of, the, animated, cartoon,, pronounced, the, doom, of, the, very, industry, he, had, inadvertently, helped, create., From, 1911-21, McCay, nursed, animation, from, a, simple, camera, trick, to, full, blown, character, animation, that, would, take, 20, years, to, be, surpassed., McCay, animated, his, films, almost, single-handed;, from, inception, to, execution, each, cartoon, was, his, and, his, alone., He, took, the, time, to, make, his, films, unique, artistic, visions,, sometimes, spending, more, than, a, year, to, make, a, single, five-minute, cartoon., But, the, burgeoning, world, of, cinema, could, not, wait, so, long, for, so, little,, and, so, the, modern, animation, studio, came, into, being., The, art, of, animation, was, no, longer, the, work, of, one, man,, it, was, a, streamlined,, assembly-line, process, in, the, best, Henry, Ford, tradition., But, was, the, art, of, the, animated, cartoon, sacrificed, for, the, trade's, sake?, That,, of, course,, depends, on, the, studios, themselves., Through, the, years, several, institutions, have, proven, McCay's, prophecy, at, least, partly, false;, indeed,, without, such, positive, collaborations, of, talent, the, art, of, animation, would, not, have, advanced, to, the, level, of, sophistication, it, enjoys, today., But, who, exactly, was, it, "bad, luck", for:, the, art,, or, the, artists, themselves?, Even, before, McCay, had, shown, the, world, the, true, potential, of, the, animated, cartoon, in, his, landmark, film, "Gertie, the, Dinosaur", (1914),, the, first, animation, studios, were, already, around,, trying, to, exploit, the, medium, for, what, they, could., Raoul, Barre', opened, the, first, animation, house, in, 1913,, and, within, five, years, a, new, industry, was, born, as, more, and, more, studios, began, to, pop, up, around, the, New, York, metropolitan, area., Arguably, the, most, successful, and, certainly, the, most, influential, of, these, early, studios, was, the, the, John, Bray, Studio., Bray, created, the, first, successful, cartoon, series,, Col., Heeza, Liar,, in, 1914., Future, studio, heads, Max, Fleischer, and, Walter, Lantz, honed, their, skills, here., But, the, studio's, most, important, contribution, to, the, medium, was, the, introduction, of, cels., The, process, of, inking, the, animator's, drawings, onto, clear, pieces, of, celluloid, and, then, photographing, them, in, succession, on, a, single, painted, background, was, invented, by, Bray, employee, Earl, Hurd, in, late, 1914., In, the, first, of, what, was, to, be, many, such, incidents,, the, studio, swallowed, all, the, credit, and, most, of, the, revenue, for, it's, underling's, contribution, to, the, art, form., Hurd, lent, his, patent, to, boss, John, Bray,, who, charged, royalties, for, other, studios, to, use, the, process....an, understandable, business, practice., Yet, from, an, artistic, standpoint, this, was, as, if, Picasso, had, demanded, exclusive, rights, to, Cubism., It, was, a, relatively, moot, point,, however;, the, patent, expired, in, 1932, and, was, not, renewed., The, only, real, loser,, it, seems,, was, Earl, Hurd., Like, Hurd,, Otto, Messmer, was, another, studio, employee, who, never, got, due, credit, for, his, innovations., But, whereas, Hurd's, contribution, to, animation, was, a, technical, one,, Messmer's, was, an, artistic, creation, that, is, still, recognized, the, world, over, 80, years, after, it's, inception., Otto, Messmer, was, employed, by, the, Pat, Sullivan, Studio, in, 1916., Three, years, later, he, created, Felix, the, Cat;, it, was, a, milestone, in, the, development, of, animation, as, an, artform., Not, since, Gertie, the, Dinosaur, had, a, cartoon, character, exhibited, such, a, degree, of, personality, animation, as, Felix's, brooding,, ponderous, walk., But, unlike, Gertie,, Felix, was, a, studio, character,, which, meant, audiences, could, look, forward, to, seeing, him, again, and, again,, while, affording, Messmer, and, his, co-workers, the, opportunity, to, explore, the, possibilities, of, ongoing, character, development, in, animation., Meanwhile,, studio, head, Pat, Sullivan, took, sole, credit, for, the, creation, of, Felix,, earning, millions, of, dollars, in, royalties, over, the, years., Messmer, continued, to, receive, his, usual, salary., A, quiet, and, unassuming, man,, Messmer, never, challenged, Sullivan's, claim, to, be, the, father, of, Felix,, even, after, Sullivan's, death, in, 1933., Indeed,, Messmer, probably, would, have, taken, the, secret, to, his, grave, had, not, animation, historian, John, Canemaker, tracked, him, down, in, 1976, (the, revelation, produced, quite, a, stir, in, animation, circles....twenty, years, later, the, story, was, lampooned, on, an, episode, of, "The, Simpsons")., For, the, first, time, a, studio, produced, what, may, be, considered, true, art,, but, in, doing, so, took, the, credit, usually, given, to, the, artist., Hands, Down, the, most, influential, studio, (from, an, artistic, as, well, as, a, commercial, standpoint), in, the, history, of, animation, is, the, Walt, Disney, Studio,, which, exploded, onto, the, scene, in, 1928, with, Mickey, Mouse, in, "Steamboat, Willie", and, continued, to, dominate, the, field, to, this, very, day., It, is, at, Disney, that, we, see, the, studio, system's, best, and, worst, effects, on, the, development, of, animation, as, an, art, form., Without, Disney's, streamlined, organization, of, talent, and, creative, collaboration, the, animated, cartoon, could, never, have, advanced, as, rapidly, or, as, beautifully, as, it, has....yet,, as, at, the, Bray, and, Sullivan, studios,, in, the, process, many, of, the, men, responsible, for, the, studio's, achievements, remain, anonymous, and, forgotten., Had, Disney, animators, Vladimir, Tytla, and, Freddie, Moore, been, alive, during, the, renaissance, their, names, might, well, have, been, numbered, among, Da, Vinci, and, Michelangelo., For, all, their, accomplishments,, however,, they, remain, totally, eclipsed, by, the, titanic, figure, of, Walt, Disney., Walt, Disney's, first, important, contribution, to, animation, was, to, move, his, studio, to, Hollywood, in, 1923., Los, Angeles, had, become, the, center, of, live-action, filmmaking,, but, the, animation, industry, remained, rooted, in, New, York, (with, a, few, studios, scattered, throughout, the, Midwest,, like, Disney's)., Accompanying, him, on, his, move, from, Kansas, City, were, Hugh, Harman, and, Rudy, Ising,, who, would, eventually, found, the, Warner, Bros., and, MGM, animation, houses., These, three, studios, were, to, become, the, leaders, of, the, animation, industry., Disney's, decision, to, move, to, California, was, a, pivotal, turning, point, in, the, development, of, animation, as, a, business., Disney, Studio's, artistic, achievements, derived, from, a, sort, of, symbiotic, relationship, between, Walt, and, his, employees., Like, other, studio, heads,, Walt, received, all, the, public, attention, and, praise, for, the, studio's, work,, but, unlike, many, of, his, fellow, producers, he, was, at, least, partly, responsible, for, the, studio's, accomplishments., He, was, certainly, a, cinematic, visionary,, and, can, be, justly, credited, for, introducing, the, latest, innovations, in, sound, and, color., Walt, was, the, one, who, steered, cartoons, away, from, the, "rubber, hose", style, of, the, silent, era, (dubbed, thus, because, of, the, way, characters, moved, without, regard, to, anatomy,, as, if, all, their, limbs, were, rubber, hoses), and, encouraged, his, artists, to, develop, a, realistic,, naturalist, style, of, animation, in, the, early, 1930s., He, was, the, moving, force, behind, such, groundbreaking, films, as, "Snow, White, and, the, Seven, Dwarfs", (1937),, the, first, full-length, animated, feature,, and, "Pinocchio", (1940),, a, film, whose, intricate, levels, of, technical, brilliance, many, animators, feel, has, never, been, surpassed., But, it, was, up, to, the, studio, artists, to, make, Disney's, ideas, reality., It, was, Freddie, Moore, who, led, the, movement, towards, realistic, motion, in, cartoons, with, his, re-definition, of, Mickey, Mouse, in, such, films, as, "The, Band, Concert", (1935)., Disney, features, like, "Lady, and, the, Tramp", (1955), and, "The, Jungle, Book", (1967), could, never, have, succeeded, without, the, polished, character, animation, of, Ollie, Johnston,, Frank, Thomas,, Eric, Larson,, and, others., Vladimir, Tytla's, rendering, of, the, demon, Chernabog, in, the, Night, on, Bald, Mountain, sequence, of, "Fantasia", (1940), might, well, be, the, greatest, work, of, animation, ever., These, extraordinarily, talented, men,, in, alliance, with, the, vision, of, their, leader,, accomplished, what, Winsor, McCay, had, deemed, impossible:, high, art, in, a, studio, setting., The, downside, to, all, this, was, of, course,, once, again,, the, studio, head, received, all, the, recognition, for, his, artist's, work., In, Disney's, case,, however,, it, doesn't, seem, to, be, attributable, to, greed, on, the, executive's, part., Walt, certainly, didn't, mind, all, the, attention,, but, he, seems, to, have, recognized, his, artist's, importance, to, his, success., Yet, to, this, day, the, Disney, staff, remain, unknown, to, the, public, at, large, (do, you, know, that, David, Hand, directed, "Snow, White"?)., It, seems, to, be, an, unfortunate, side, effect, in, the, development, of, animation, studios, that, individual, contributions, to, the, medium, should, go, uncredited., The, men, behind, Warner, Bros., cartoon, juggernaut, "Looney, Tunes", and, "Merrie, Melodies", have, managed, to, beat, the, odds, and, achieve, a, degree, of, prominence, in, the, public, eye., Then, again,, maybe, that's, because, they, have, such, unusual, and, distinct, monikers, like, Friz, Freleng,, Tex, Avery,, and, Chuck, Jones., But, to, claim, thus, would, be, to, belittle, their, accomplishments,, and, for, once, in, the, history, of, animation's, Golden, Age, the, names, of, the, artists, outshine, the, name, of, the, producer., "Looney, Tunes", began, in, 1930, when, Disney, vets, Hugh, Harman, and, Rudy, Ising, teamed, with, producer, Leon, Schlesinger, to, make, cartoons,, to, be, distributed, by, Warner, Bros., Three, years, later, Harman, and, Ising, left, to, form, the, MGM, cartoon, studio,, and, Schlesinger, and, his, artists, continued, on, their, own., Unlike, other, studio, heads, who, craved, the, limelight,, Schlesinger, (and, his, successor, Eddie, Selzer), seems, to, have, been, concerned, only, with, making, money., He, left, it, to, his, directors, and, animators, to, meet, the, press,, and, gave, them, complete, artistic, freedom, at, the, office....so, long, as, it, was, under, budget., The, Warners, artists, used, their, creative, freedom, to, take, the, medium, in, new, directions., Directors, Tex, Avery, and, Bob, Clampett, broke, from, the, Disney, tradition, that, the, other, studios, had, begun, to, mimic, and, imbibed, their, films, with, highly, exaggerated, slapstick, comedy., In, Avery's, "Porky's, Duck, Hunt", (the, first, appearance, of, Daffy, Duck,, 1937), and, Clampett's, "Porky, in, Wackyland", (1938),, the, characters, appear, at, first, to, be, of, the, naturalist, Disney, school,, but, are, constantly, distorted, beyond, all, rationality,, defying, every, law, of, physics, for, comedic, effect., The, other, Warners, artists, immediately, picked, up, on, the, style,, and, eventually, every, other, studio,, even, Disney,, adopted, the, method., Slapstick, ultimately, proved, to, be, the, theatrical, genre, animation, was, best, suited, for., Like, Disney,, the, Warner, Bros., studio, turned, the, assembly-line-art, system, to, their, advantage, and, collaborated, their, talents, to, take, the, art, to, a, higher, level., Nowhere, is, this, better, exlempified, than, in, the, creation, and, development, of, Bugs, Bunny,, arguably, the, greatest, cartoon, character, ever., It, took, over, 10, years, and, 30, films, for, Bugs', personality, to, coalesce, into, the, suave, and, wily, comic, hero, that, he, is, today., During, that, period, he, was, continually, tweaked, by, various, directors, and, redesigned, several, times, by, different, animators,, notably, Bob, McKimson., By, 1950, Warners', three, animation, units, had, reached, a, consensus, as, to, who, Bugs, was, and, how, he, looked;, while, each, unit, made, it's, own, cartoons,, it, was, the, same, Bugs, Bunny, every, time., Without, the, tandem, talents, of, Jones,, Freleng,, et.al.,, it, is, unlikely, that, Bugs, would, have, been, as, fully, fleshed-out, a, character, as, he, eventually, became., It, was, when, animation, finally, made, the, leap, to, television, that, the, art, truly, began, to, suffer, for, business's, sake., The, great, Hollywood, studios, of, the, 30s,, 40s,, and, 50s, had, been, manned, by, people, genuinely, interested, in, making, quality, cinema., The, denizens, of, the, TV, animation, houses, of, the, 60s,, 70s,, and, 80s, only, cared, that, the, product, was, there, to, market., The, quality, of, writing, was, poor,, and, the, animation, itself, was, often, so, limited, it, barely, qualified, as, animation, at, all., McCay's, prophecy, had, finally, come, to, pass., Cartoons, made, exclusively, for, television, had, been, around, since, Jay, Ward's, "Crusader, Rabbit", in, 1949,, but, production, of, TV, animation, didn't, really, hit, it's, stride, until, about, 1960,, when, most, of, the, cinematic, cartoon, studios, had, shut, their, doors., Bill, Hanna, and, Joe, Barbara,, former, MGM, directors, and, creators, of, Tom, and, Jerry,, dominated, the, market, almost, from, it's, inception, and, continued, to, do, so, through, the, 1970s., Unfortunately,, Hanna, and, Barbara, never, understood, that, just, because, something, works, once,, that, doesn't, mean, the, same, thing, will, work, again, and, again., In, their, 20, years, together, at, MGM, they, never, made, anything, except, Tom, and, Jerry, cartoons., But, at, least, Tom, and, Jerry, had, been, well, animated, and, cleverly, written., The, duo's, television, hits, are, considerably, lesser, in, quality, (one, gets, the, feeling, they, succeeded, merely, because, there, was, nothing, better, on),, and, the, myriad, self-imitations, of, every, successful, show, they, had, were, downright, abysmal., Despite, it's, flat,, one-dimensional, characters, and, campy,, formulatic, stories,, "Scooby-Doo", proved, extremely, popular, in, 1969,, so, Hanna-Barbara, made, "Speed, Buggy",, "Jabber, Jaw",, and, "The, Clue, Club",, which, were, all, variations, on, the, same, characters, and, theme., "The, Flintstones", begat, "The, Jetsons",, and, "The, Smurfs", begat, "The, Snorks"., It, was, a, process, that, stunted, creativity,, giving, the, artists, even, less, of, a, chance, to, infuse, life, into, their, work., Other, TV, cartoon, studios, like, Filmation, and, DIC, proved, little, better, or, even, worse, than, Hanna-Barbara., Desperate, to, conquer, as, much, air, time, as, possible,, the, studios, churned, out, series, after, series, without, any, regard, to, aesthetic., The, situation, improved, in, the, second, half, of, the, 1980s, when, the, two, big, studios, of, old,, Disney, and, Warner, Bros.,, entered, the, market., Shows, like, Disney's, "DuckTales", (1986), and, Warners', "Tiny, Toon, Adventures", (1989), were, considerably, better, than, anything, their, competitors, were, producing., Yet, they, still, fell, utterly, short, of, the, great, cartoons, made, for, the, movies, in, the, first, half, of, the, century., The, budget, restraints, and, hurried, deadlines, of, the, television, industry, simply, prohibited, artists, from, crafting, the, kind, of, art, their, cinematic, predecessors, achieved., Finally, in, the, 1990s, the, artists, in, the, television, cartoon, industry, began, to, figure, out, how, to, work, effectively, with, the, limitations, of, the, field., 1992, saw, the, debut, of, Warner, Bros., "Batman:, The, Animated, Series.", Despite, the, fact, that, the, animation, was, contracted, to, various, Oriental, studios, (by, the, mid, 80s, the, practice, was, almost, universal, in, television, production....it, continues, to, be, so, today), the, show's, creators, Bruce, Timm,, Paul, Dini,, Eric, Radomski,, and, others, managed, to, infuse, the, series, with, a, distinct, visual, style., Combined, with, the, deep, characterizations, and, strong, stories,, "Batman", was, a, first-rate, cartoon., While, they, did, not, attract, as, much, publicity, as, Disney's, theatrical, department,, the, Warner, Bros., TV, artists, were, just, as, important, to, the, art, of, animation,, demonstrating, that, even, a, television, cartoon, series, was, capable, of, artistic, achievement., Back, on, the, big, screen, the, medium, faced, a, different, set, of, problems., Since, the, advent, of, television, people, were, no, longer, spending, all, day, at, the, movies,, and, short, subjects, were, gradually, dropped, from, the, billings., While, animation, never, completely, disappeared, from, theaters,, by, the, 1960s, most, studios, had, closed, down;, the, ones, that, didn't, suffered, from, severe, declines, in, quality., Only, Disney, retained, it's, level, of, excellence,, but, Disney, had, ceased, full-time, production, of, short, subjects, by, the, mid-50s,, earlier, than, anyone, else., While, there, was, the, occasional, Non-Disney, animated, feature,, no, other, studio, was, producing, them, on, a, regular, basis., By, the, 1980s, no, studio, was, producing, shorts, full-time,, and, even, the, Disney, movies, had, lost, their, appeal., The, new, generation, of, Disney, artists, breathed, life, back, into, animation, with, films, like, "Who, Framed, Roger, Rabbit?", (1988), and, "The, Little, Mermaid", (1989)., These, well-crafted, cartoons, were, celebrations, of, animation's, glory, days,, and, the, public, proved, just, as, nostalgic, as, the, artists, themselves., The, new, Disney, crew, proved, that, the, studio, system, was, still, capable, of, turning, out, great, art., In, fact,, the, major, flaw, of, the, studio, system,, lack, of, artist, recognition,, dissipated., Gone, were, the, producer-moguls, of, old,, and, with, no, Walt, Disney, public, attention, finally, shifted, to, the, artists, themselves., While, not, exactly, household, names,, directors, John, Musker, and, Ron, Clements, and, animators, like, Glen, Keane, and, Andreas, Deja, certainly, received, more, press, than, Disney, vets, like, Milt, Kahl, or, Wolfgang, Reitherman, did, in, their, heyday., It, was, inevitable,, in, spite, of, Winsor, McCay's, warnings,, that, animation, would, become, a, "trade", in, the, form, of, the, studio, system., The, complexities, of, bringing, moving, drawings, to, life, on, the, screen, are, too, time-consuming, and, too, expensive, for, it, to, have, developed, otherwise., Fortunately,, through, the, years, there, have, been, many, individuals, working, in, the, field, who, have, been, careful, not, to, let, business, logistics, overwhelm, the, artistic, potential, of, the, medium., The, collective, nature, of, the, studio, may, prevent, the, artists, from, receiving, the, amount, of, praise, an, artist, working, solo, garners,, but, the, art, attained, is, no, less, great., As, long, as, there, are, creative, men, and, women, behind, the, drawing, desk,, the, animated, cartoon, will, continue, to, be, the, best, of, both, worlds:, a, trade, and, an, art., --, In, 1999,, Michael, Crandol, entered, this, essay, into, a, contest, sponsored, by,
