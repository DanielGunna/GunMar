there, too.), From, the, YouTube, Page:, I, began, writing, my, Harry, Potter, fantasy, back, in, 2004, or, maybe, even, 2003., It, isn’t, because, of, writer’s, block, that, it, took, so, long, to, finish;, it’s, just, that, I, would, put, it, on, the, back, burner, for, weeks,, months,, and, at, one, point, even, years, at, a, time, to, focus, on, being, a, pianist!, But, whenever, I, would, bring, it, out, again,, it, would, immediately, transport, me, back, into, the, magical, world, of, Hogwarts, and, all, of, those, friends’, adventures., This,, I, think,, is, largely, due, to, John, Williams’s, irresistible, main, theme, that, is, woven, throughout, the, scores, to, all, the, movies,, even, the, later, sequels, whose, scores, he, didn’t, write, himself., It’s, called, “Hedwig’s, Theme”, (named, for, the, owl, that, is, Harry’s, constant, companion, throughout),, and, is,, for, my, money,, one, of, JW’s, more, successful, tunes, in, a, career, of, hugely, successful, tunes., This, theme, is, the, basis, for, my, fantasy., It, started, out, as, almost, —, and, I, say, “almost”, very, pointedly,, because, there, are, also, a, few, fun, quotes, from, other,, not, unrelated,, music, —, a, theme, and, variations,, but, then,, at, a, certain, point,, I, discovered, that, it, wanted, to, go, somewhere, else;, after, a, few, variations,, it, seems, to, come, to, a, kind, of, resting-place,, where, it, wonders, about, the, main, material, for, a, few, measures,, and, then, takes, off, in, a, flurry, of, other, themes,, some, of, which, have, been, hinted, at, before., It, builds, to, a, huge, climax, using, the, “Family, Portrait”, material,, which, then, abates, a, little, and, then, builds, up, again, into,, yes:, a, fugue., (I, had, to.), The, fugue, uses, all, of, the, Harry-Potter-related, material, we’ve, heard, so, far., Then, this, builds, to, an, even, bigger, climax, ,, where, a, surprise, (and,, again,, not, unrelated), theme, gets, aired, for, a, few, measures,, but, then, it, keeps, going, until, it, seems, as, if, the, very, fabric, of, the, universe, gets, ripped, in, half., Out, of, that, mist, creeps, Hedwig’s, Theme, in, a, haze, of, disorientation;, after, considering, all, that, has, come, before,, it, comes, down, and, touches, ground, again., Where, it, touches, down, is,, of, course,, anyone’s, guess!, I, hope, you, have, as, much, fun, listening, to, my, “Fantasy, on, Themes, from, Harry, Potter”, as, I’ve, had, writing, it., And,, though, it, took, nearly, seven, years, to, write,, it, only, takes, about, eleven,
