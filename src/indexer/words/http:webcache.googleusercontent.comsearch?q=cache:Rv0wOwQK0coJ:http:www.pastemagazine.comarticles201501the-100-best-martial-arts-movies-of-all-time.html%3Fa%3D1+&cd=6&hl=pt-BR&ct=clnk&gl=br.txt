Fighting,, whether, sanctioned, or, no-holds-barred,, is, without, a, doubt, the, oldest, form, of, competition, that, mankind, has, ever, engaged, in., At, times,, it, has, been, a, necessary, tool, of, survival—kill, or, be, killed—and, that, proved, an, extremely, effective, motivation, and, crucible, for, enhancing, mankind’s, fighting, prowess., Technology, rapidly, came, into, play, and, has, been, seen, out, to, its, inevitable, conclusion,, which, removes, man, from, the, equation, almost, entirely., Today,, robotic, drones, are, poised, to, do, much, of, our, fighting, for, us—whether, we, ultimately, end, up, in, a, Robot, Jox, scenario, where, wars, are, decided, by, giant, mech, battles, is, a, valid, (and, awesome), question., And, yet,, despite, all, of, our, sophistication, and, technology,, we, still, fight, by, hand, as, well., Some, is, driven, by, necessity., Others, fight, professionally,, and, have, only, continued, to, expand, the, complete, picture, of, what, a, fighter, is., Look, at, the, exponential, growth, in, sophistication, from, the, early, days, of, mixed, martial, arts, to, how, the, sport, has, become, in, 2015,, going, from, big, guys, winging, punches, at, one, another, to, a, beautiful,, scientific, system, of, mixed, grappling, and, striking, styles., The, audience, has, never, been, bigger,, because, on, some, level,, we, love, fighting,, if, only, because, it, reminds, us, of, our, most, primal, roots, that, have, long, been, shelved, and, put, aside, by, civilization., And, nowhere, is, appreciation, for, the, beauty, of, fighting, more, apparent, than, in, the, wide,, storied, genre, of, martial, arts, cinema., Violence, is, the, selling, point, of, these, films,, but, seeing, as, that, violence, is, achieved, through, trickery,, stunt, work, and, movie, magic,, it’s, not, truly, the, audience’s, bloodlust, that, drives, the, industry., It’s, an, appreciation, for, the, beauty, of, violence,, a, reminder, of, the, exceptional, abilities, derived, through, training, and, a, celebration, of, ancient,, classical, storytelling,, in, the, vein, of, “Avenge, me!”, No, genre, reveres, classic, themes, as, this, one, does,, because, at, their, root, they, speak, to, us, like, cinematic, comfort, food,, and, they, provide, excuses, for, what, people, have, really, wanted, to, see, all, along:, The, action., And, so,, let, us, celebrate, the, martial, arts, genre, from, its, top, to, its, bottom,, old, and, new., Epic, and, modest., Comedic, and, tragic., Grave, and, absurd,, all, represented, in, equal, measure., These, films, contain, many, wondrous, sights:, Monks, training, their, bodies, to, repel, bullets., Men, with, prosthetic, iron, hands, shooting, poison, darts., Flying, heads., Incredibly, silly, ninja, costumes., It’s, all, here., But, please, note,, don’t, look, for, Seven, Samurai,, Yojimbo, or, The, Sword, of, Doom, here., Although, they’re, all, great, films,, we, wanted, this, list, to, focus, squarely, on, our, conception, of, “martial, arts, cinema,”, which, has, little, in, common, with, a, great, samurai, drama, by, Akira, Kurosawa., These, films, are, action-packed, fighting, spectacles,, but, above, all,, they’re, just, plain, fun., 100., Ninja, Terminator, Year:, 1985, Director:, Godfrey, Ho, This, is, a, list, of, the, 100, greatest, martial, arts, films, of, all, time,, but, at, the, tail, end,, let, us, make, a, small, space, for, those, flicks, that, are, enjoyable, but, unquestionably, of, extremely, low, quality., And, oh, my,, Ninja, Terminator, is, certainly, that., Perhaps, the, single, most, infamous, film, in, the, legendarily, cheap, career, of, Hong, Kong, z-film, auteur, Godfrey, Ho,, it, displays, most, of, his, trademarks—primarily, footage, from, multiple,, unrelated, movies, spliced, together, to, create, a, sort, of, “movie, loaf”, of, unrelated, fight, scenes, and, nonsensical, dubbing., Half, of, the, movie, revolves, around, American, actor, Richard, Harrison, seeking, a, cheap, plastic, statue, that, grants, super, ninja, powers,, while, an, unrelated, plot, features, one, of, screendom’s, great, badass, heroes,, “Jaguar, Wong,”, vs., some, guy, in, a, bizarre, blonde, wig., At, this, point,, you, may, be, thinking, “It, will, make, more, sense, when, I’m, actually, watching,”, but, you, would, be, fatally, wrong., All, in, all,, though,, Ninja, Terminator, is, hilariously, mangled, viewing., —Jim, Vorel, 99., Battle, Wizard, Year:, 1977, Director:, Hsueh, Li, Pao, By, the, end, of, the, ’70s,, Hong, Kong, kung, fu, cinema, had, reached, the, apex, of, its, classical, period, and, began, to, fork, paths, wildly,, hurtling, down, a, road, of, ever-increasing, decadence, and,, finally,, absurdity., One, of, the, main, offshoots, were, films, in, the, vein, of, Battle, Wizard,, which, combined, a, hodgepodge, of, Eastern, and, Western, mysticism, and, magic, into, stories, that, otherwise, resemble, classic, period, piece, kung, fu, films., The, result, is, like, throwing, several, movies, in, a, blender, and, just, hitting, “puree”—flying, wizards, hurling, lightning, bolts,, ghosts,, monsters, vs., the, flying, fists, of, proud, kung, fu, warriors., The, only, way, to, truly, understand, is, to, just, witness, a, few, minutes, of, a, film, like, Battle, Wizard., Is, that, a, kung, fu-fighting, guy, in, a, gorilla, suit?, Yep., A, fire-breathing, wizard, with, extendable, wooden, chicken, legs?, Sure., A, man, swallowing, a, glowing, frog, whole?, Of, course., This, is, Battle, Wizard,, fool., —J.V., 98., Ninja, III:, The, Domination, Year:, 1984, Director:, Sam, Firstenberg, You, will, quickly, suss, out, that, a, lot, of, the, “fun-bad”, movies, at, the, bottom, of, the, list, are, ninja-centric:, This, is, not, a, coincidence., In, the, 1980s,, ninjas, came, into, the, vogue, as, bad, movie, villains, du, jour, in, both, American, and, cheap, z-grade, Chinese, cinema,, even, though, the, depiction, had, pretty, much, nothing, to, do, with, historical, ninjitsu., On, the, positive, side,, it, gave, us, Teenage, Mutant, Ninja, Turtles., On, the, negative,, the, likes, of, Ninja, III:, The, Domination,, but, few, of, these, films, are, as, campily, bad, as, this, one., The, story, revolves, around, an, aerobics, instructor, (all, women, in, ’80s, films, are, aerobics, instructors), who, is, possessed, by, the, spirit, of, an, evil, ninja, who, can, only, be, defeated, in, one-on-one, ninja, combat., Soon,, swords, are, levitating,, exorcisms, are, happening,, and, a, hapless, executive, just, trying, to, have, a, nice, round, of, golf, finds, himself, hunted, by, bloodthirsty, golf, ninjas., —J.V., 97., Legend, of, the, 7, Golden, Vampires, Year:, 1974, Director:, Roy, Ward, Baker, Certainly, one, of, the, weirdest, co-studio, crossovers, to, come, out, of, the, ’70s,, Legend, of, the, 7, Golden, Vampires, is, the, product, of, veteran, Hong, Kong, kung, fu, factory, The, Shaw, Brothers, teaming, up, with, Hammer, Studios,, the, makers, of, classic, British, ’50s, and, ’60s, Frankenstein, and, Dracula, films., In, fact,, this, is, actually, the, final, Hammer, “Dracula”, in, their, long, series,, and, the, only, one, to, (thank, god), not, star, Christopher, Lee, as, the, count., Instead,, the, inane, story, is, about, Dracula, traveling, to, rural, China,, where, he, takes, control, of, a, coven, of, seven, Chinese, vampires, with, desiccated,, beef, jerky, faces., A, 61-year-old, Peter, Cushing, returns, to, the, series, as, heroic, Van, Helsing, to, give, one, more, go, of, it,, but, because, his, brittle, bones, weren’t, capable, of, much, more, than, standing, at, that, point,, he’s, also, backed, up, by, a, family, of, kung-fu, brothers, with, cheap, tin-foil, weaponry., This, led, to, the, film’s, hilarious, American, title:, The, Seven, Brothers, and, Their, One, Sister, Meet, Dracula., Catchy!, —J.V., 96., Miami, Connection, Year:, 1987, Director:, Richard, Park, Late, ’80s?, Check., Motorcycle-riding, taekwondo, synth, rock, bands?, Check., Ninja, drug, smuggler, gangs?, That’s, a, big, check., Miami, Connection, is, one, of, the, most, deliriously, entertaining, and, inexplicable, films, to, ever, disappear, for, a, few, decades, before, being, rediscovered,, as, it, blissfully, was, by, The, Alamo, Drafthouse, in, the, late, 2000s., This, alternatingly, sincere, and, conceited, vanity, project, was, a, labor, of, love, from, Y.K., Kim,, a, taekwondo, proponent, and, motivational, speaker, who, really, seemed, to, believe, that, his, film, about, positivity,, music, and, severed, limbs, would, help, clean, up, the, streets., It, most, assuredly, failed, at, this,, but, on, the, plus, side, it, gave, us, incredible,, genuinely, catchy, songs, like, Friends, Forever, and, the, spectacle, of, Y.K., Kim, pretending, he, knows, how, to, play, guitar., —J.V., 95., Crippled, Masters, Year:, 1979, Director:, Joe, Law, “Martial, arts”, is, a, sprawling,, overarching, film, genre, that, encompasses, several, large, offshoots, and, dozens, of, very, niche, micro-genres., How, niche?, Well,, niche, enough, to, support, the, term, “cripsploitation”, for, movies, like, Crippled, Masters., Unlike, other, films, of, the, period, that, often, portrayed, otherwise, able-bodied, actors, as, handicapped, fighters,, however,, Crippled, Masters, stars, two, genuinely, handicapped, people—a, man, with, no, arms, and, a, man, with, no, legs., They, both, play, kung, fu, students, who, are, crippled, by, their, cruel, master, and, train, for, years, before, seeking, their, revenge., I, won’t, lie, to, you—it’s, a, genuinely, disturbing, flick, to, watch, at, times,, but, there’s, some, legit, physical, talent, on, display., And, to, answer, the, obvious, question:, Yes,, the, guy, with, no, legs, eventually, sits, on, the, shoulders, of, the, guy, with, no, arms, to, form, a, Voltron-like, super, fighter., Obviously., -—J.V., 94., Undisputed, 2, Year:, 2006, Director:, Isaac, Florentine, Ah,, direct-to-video, martial, arts., Few, genres, are, so, direct, in, appeasing, their, fan-base:, There’s, no, attempted, subterfuge, about, who, the, audience, is, here., The, men, who, watch, these, flicks, aren’t, watching, for, the, story;, they’re, watching, for, the, action,, and, action, is, the, bar, by, which, they’re, all, judged., In, this,, Undisputed, 2, delivers, thanks, to, its, dual, stars,, Michael, Jai, White, and, Scott, Adkins., The, story, is, a, half-serious, attempt, at, sequelizing, the, 2002, Wesley, Snipes/Ving, Rhames, prison, boxing, movie,, but, in, reality, this, is, simply, name, appropriation, by, a, director, who, wanted, to, make, a, flashy, martial, arts, flick., Michael, Jai, White, plays, a, boxer, fighting, for, his, freedom,, but, once, again:, Doesn’t, matter., You, know, what, does, matter?, Spin-kicks., Spin-kicks, and, broken, legs, and, slow-motion, spin-kicks., —J.V., 93., Undisputed, 3, Year:, 2010, Director:, Isaac, Florentine, As, it, turns, out,, the, breakout, character, of, Undisputed, 2, is, actually, the, Russian, villain, Boyka,, who, here, takes, on, the, hero, role., This, sequel, makes, even, less, of, an, attempt, to, hide, its, desire, to, simply, be, a, collection, of, individual, fight, scenes,, and, that, actually, makes, for, an, even, more, entertaining, exercise, in, film, violence., It, features, that, greatest, of, martial, arts, structuring, devices:, The, tournament., Ever, since, Enter, the, Dragon,, it’s, been, the, premiere, way, of, showcasing, random, fights, without, having, to, muck, around, with, plot,, and, that’s, what, this, film, is, all, about., The, tournament, gives, Boyka, a, variety, of, fighters, with, different, styles, to, contend, against,, and, we, continue, to, be, rewarded, with, the, Undisputed, series’, primary, export:, Absurdly, impractical, and, undeniably, beautiful, spin-kicks., —J.V., 92., Enter, the, Ninja, Year:, 1981, Director:, Menahem, Golan, Have, you, ever, seen, someone, dress, as, a, ninja, for, Halloween?, Or, any, ninja, costume, in, general?, If, so,, you, pretty, much, have, Enter, the, Ninja, to, thank., This, is, a, genuinely, terrible, film,, but, a, hugely, influential, and, entertaining, one, as, well., It, is,, in, short,, the, film, that, firmly, established, most, of, the, iconic, ninja, tropes, in, the, West—the, stereotypical, black,, masked, outfits,, the, throwing, stars,, the, katanas., Also, notable, as, perhaps, the, first, of, the, “This, guy’s, white,, he, can’t, be, a, true, ninja!”, films,, which, would, be, copied, incessantly, for, years., It’s, also, notable, for, introducing, Sho, Kosugi, to, an, American, audience,, the, guy, who, would, go, on, to, become, the, iconic, ninja, in, nearly, a, dozen, other, films., Enter, the, Ninja, might, well, be, one, of, the, most, imitated, films, of, the, entire, 1980s., —J.V., 91., Zu:, Warriors, from, the, Magic, Mountain, Year:, 1983, Director:, Tsui, Hark, One, thing, no, one, can, fault, Tsui, Hark, for, is, his, boundless, ambition,, which, is, why,, next, to, Stephen, Chow,, Hark’s, contributions, to, the, canon, of, martial, arts, films, are, some, of, its, biggest, and, most, confusingly, bloated., Zu:, Warriors, from, the, Magic, Mountain, may, be, the, ballsiest, of, all, of, the, Hong, Kong, director’s, epic, feats,, an, attempt, to, wed, the, action, flicks, of, his, home, with, the, kind, of, big, budget, fantasy, pieces, beloved, by, Western, audiences, in, the, ’80s,, and, later, made, ubiquitous, by, directors, like, Jim, Henson and, Wolfgang, Peterson., Although, practically, incomprehensible, at, times,, Zu, takes, a, standard, mythological, story—that, of, gods, who, inhabit, a, mountain, fortress-like, home, and,, in, the, process, of, defending, that, home, from, a, benevolent, enemy,, take, in, a, wayward, but, stubbornly, idealistic, mortal—and, stuffs, it, with, enough, special, effects, to, choke, even, the, most, dedicated, workhorse, of, a, fan., Gelatinous, skull, spirits, and, metal, wing, capes, and, weird, asteroids, where, wiggly, souls, are, reborn:, best, to, let, it, just, happen., That, Tsui, Hark, also, tapped, into, the, core, of, what, makes, the, goofiest, martial, arts, films, tick, is, something, that,, more, than, 30, years, later,, is, still, a, testament, to, a, director, who, made, a, film, more, veteran, directors, wouldn’t, touch, with, a, 10-foot,, bamboo,, 8-diagram-nurtured, pole., —Dom, Sinacola, 90., American, Ninja, Year:, 1985, Director:, Sam, Firstenberg, This, is, what, happens, when, American, audiences, see, Enter, the, Ninja, and, ask, “Could, the, ninja, be, more, American?, And, can, we, do, away, with, the, dubbing?”, Still, produced, by, Golan-Globus,, it, takes, the, ninja, story, and, gives, it, a, corny, American, twist—our, hero, is, now, Private, Joe, Armstrong,, who, “chooses, to, enlist, in, the, U.S., Army, rather, than, go, to, prison, and, finds, himself, fighting, off, ninjas, on, a, base, in, the, Philippines.”, Ask, any, Filipino—those, islands, are, rife, with, ninja., You, can’t, swing, a, nunchuck, in, the, Philippines, without, hitting, a, ninja,, I’m, telling, you., It, was, followed, by, four, sequels, and, an, unrelated, movie, called, American, Samurai, from, the, same, director, because, hey,, why, the, hell, not., You’re, gonna, want, to, showcase, Michael, Dudikoff, as, much, as, you, can—“HE, POSSESS, GREAT, SKILLS,”, after, all., —J.V., 89., Only, The, Strong, Year:, 1993, Director:, Sheldon, Lettich, Many, of, the, films, so, far, have, been, profoundly, ’80s,, but, Only, the, Strong, is, the, early, ’90s., It, feels, like, the, Full, House, of, martial, arts, films,, chock, full, of, positivity,, smiling,, day-glo, colors, and, life-lessons, galore., Showcasing, the, dance-infused, Brazilian, martial, art, of, capoeira,, it, stars, future, Iron, Chef, chairman, Mark, Dacascos, as, a, soldier-turned-teacher, who, must, clean, up, an, exceedingly, rowdy, class, of, inner-city, ne’er, do, wells, by, teaching, them, self-worth, and, occasionally, by, punching, them, in, the, face., It’s, like, an, after-school, special, collided, with, a, kung, fu, movie., The, incredibly, oily,, metrosexual, villain, Silverio, is, particularly, memorable—I, love, that, the, thing, to, send, him, into, a, rage, in, the, final, battle, is, having, part, of, his, luxurious,, flowing, hair, cut, off, by, a, sword, swipe., Thank, god, Mark’s, students, are, there, to, sing, a, catchy, tune, and, fill, him, with, fighting, spirit!, —J.V., 88., Mystery, of, Chessboxing,, aka, Ninja, Checkmate, Year:, 1979, Director:, Joseph, Kuo, Classic, Hong, Kong, kung, fu, in, style, but, somewhat, unusual, in, its, delivery,, Mystery, of, Chessboxing, is, the, sort, of, film, that, was, churned, out, of, China, in, the, ’70s,, many, of, which, are, now, forgotten., A, protagonist, seeking, revenge, for, his, slain, father, is, the, stuff, of, kung, fu, cliché,, but, the, flick, does, manage, to, stand, out, for, a, couple, of, reasons., First, is, the, odd, form, of, kung, fu, that, the, hero, learns,, which, takes, its, cues, from, the, movements, of, Xiangqi,, also, called, Chinese, chess., Second, (and, most, importantly), is, the, film’s, villain,, the, epically, titled, “Ghost-Faced, Killer,”, who, hunts, his, targets, before, throwing, down, a, decorative, “ghost-faced, killing, plate”, and, dispatching, them, with, his, trademark, Five, Elements, style., The, name, is, of, course, the, inspiration, for, Wu-Tang, Clan, member, Ghostface, Killah,, who, also, appears, on, their, kung, fu, song, “Da, Mystery, of, Chessboxin.”, —J.V., 87., Hard, To, Kill, Year:, 1990, Director:, Bruce, Malmuth, Apparently, 1990, was, the, year, big, puffy, guys, practicing, karate, won, over, the, hearts, of, America., A, massive, box, office, success,, but, an, equally, massive, critical, failure,, Hard, To, Kill, basically, solidified, Steven, Seagal, as, an, inexplicable, Hollywood goldmine., How, this, came, about, is, perhaps, one, of, cinema’s, greatest, modern, mysteries,, because, watching, Steven, Seagal, slowly, fight, bad, guys,, pretend, he’s, in, a, coma,, pretend, he’s, waking, from, a, coma,, pretend, he’s, training, through, two, separate, montages,, pretend, he’s, a, buff,, sexy, Lothario, through, two, separate, love, scenes, (two, uncomfortably, handsy, love, scenes),, and, then,, in, a, legitimately, disturbing, final, scene,, wherein, Mega, Creep, Seagal, derives, sinister, pleasure, out, of, hunting, down, the, Senator, who, murdered, his, wife,, pretends, that, he, is, literally, hard, to, kill,, a, specter, of, a, man, haunting, evildoers’, dreams., There, is, absolutely, nothing, impressive, about, Steven, Seagal, as, an, actor,, let, alone, as, a, martial, artist—there, is, only, weirdness., Relentless,, excessive, weirdness., And, yet—watchability., And, the, closest, we’ll, ever, get, to, seeing, Seagal, without, a, shirt., And, one-liners., So, many, one-liners., —D.S., 86., Tai, Chi, Zero, Year:, 2012, Director:, Stephen, Fung, A, 3D, spectacle, down, to, its, fat, nuts, and, bolts,, Tai, Chi, Zero, recognizes, no, bounds,, no, lines,, and, no, walls, preventing, it, from, being, anything—and, everything—it, wants, to, be., A, breathless, mess, of, steampunk,, underground, comics,, slapstick,, farce,, historical, romance,, and, top, hats,, all, duct-taped, to, a, restless, skeleton, of, fantasy, cinema,, Tai, Chi, Zero, has, its, precisely, placed, thumbs, in, pretty, much, every, proverbial, pie., A, proper, heir, to, Stephen, Chow’s, broadly, imagined, kung, fu, world,, Fung, is, a, filmmaker, who, seems, limitless, in, potential., Stay, tuned:, his, Kickboxer, reboot, emerges, later, this, year., There’s, no, doubt, he’ll, kill, it., —D.S., 85., Shaolin, Soccer, Year:, 2002, Director:, Stephen, Chow, Set, in, an, alternate, universe, where, the, Three, Stooges, were, down-on-their-luck, monks, and, kung, fu, nothing, more, than, a, silly, distraction, from, more, lucrative, adult, matters,, Shaolin, Soccer, somehow—between, impromptu, dance, numbers,, confusing, body, dynamics,, self-help, homilies,, a, whole, lot, of, hilarious, screaming,, and, an, utter, commitment, to, CGI—tells, a, warm-hearted, tale, about, how, martial, arts, is, so, much, more, than, a, way, to, kick, your, enemies, in, the, face, really, hard., It’s, a, way, of, life., As, such,, Stephen, Chow, shines,, suffusing, every, shot, and, every, bit, of, visual, minutiae, with, the, unbridled, excitement, of, both, those, who, make, action, flicks, and, those, who, adoringly, watch, them., Though, he’d, later, go, on, to, perfect, his, madcap, brand, of, big-budget,, beat-em-up, fantasy,, Shaolin, Soccer, is, nearly, perfect, as, an, example, of, a, martial, arts, film, that, seems, to, exist, on, its, own, space-time, continuum., —D.S., 84., Teenage, Mutant, Ninja, Turtles, Year:, 1990, Director:, Steve, Barron, Akin, more, to, a, creeping, chambara, flick, or, a, meditative, piece, of, kung-fu, canon, than, cash-grabbing, kids’, fodder,, the, first, live-action, attempt, at, a, Ninja, Turtles, movie, now, seems—after, decades, of, reboots, and, big-budget, spectacles, geared, at, children, but, tailored, to, functionally, no, one, (as, any, movie, Michael, Bay produces, typically, is)—a, movie, worthy, of, its, workmanlike, martial, arts, action., Once, you, get, past, the, explicitly, turtle-based, finishing, moves, (like, the, shell-smushing, knock-outs), and, the, Domino’s, Pizza, plugs,, what’s, left, is, a, brooding, narrative, and, surprisingly, extended,, unadorned, fight, scenes., Although, Teenage, Mutant, Ninja, Turtles, is, still, staunchly, a, product, of, its, time, (featuring, a, young,, greasy, Sam, Rockwell as, “Head, Thug,”, no, less),, it’s, also, a, handsome,, even, appealingly, gritty, film,, shot, with, sepia, filters, and, samurai, silhouettes,, and, threaded, throughout, by, the, kinds, of, panoramic, melees, that, all, these, years, later, M., Night, Shyamalan, attempted, with, The, Last, Airbender, and, then, failed., Look, especially, to, the, brawl, in, April’s, family’s, antique, shop, to, witness, how, four, grown, men, in, turtle, costumes—that, have, gotta, weigh, a, ton—combatting, a, bunch, of, ninjas, can, best, serve, director, Barron’s, unexpected, talent, at, flushing, out, visual, space, in, order, to, make, a, dead, premise, feel—seriously—lived, in., Plus,, this, marks, the, only, time, you’ll, ever, find, Corey, Feldman, on, a, list, like, this., —D.S., 83., Sword, Stained, With, Royal, Blood, Year:, 1981, Director:, Chang, Cheh, This, is, the, first, film, on, the, list, both, directed, by, prolific, kung, fu, auteur, Chang, Cheh, and, starring, the, Venom, Mob,, but, there, will, be, several, more., The, Venom, Mob, were, a, group, of, Shaw, Brothers, martial, artists, who, rose, to, fame, in, the, late, ’70s, and, became, some, of, the, biggest, stars, in, their, business, for, several, years., Sword, Stained, With, Royal, Blood, is, one, of, their, minor, classics,, but, displays, many, of, the, classic, trademarks,, with, beautifully, choreographed, action, sequences,, wonderful, athleticism, and, a, mix, of, different, physical, styles., The, story, is, a, bit, of, a, sprawling, coming-of-age, tale, about, an, exiled, young, boy, who, must, train, in, kung, fu, and, one, day, confront, his, father’s, betrayers—classic, kung, fu, stuff., Expect, flying, swords, and, acrobatics, galore., —J.V., 82., The, Bride, With, White, Hair, Year:, 1993, Director:, Ronny, Yu, As, much, romance, as, martial, arts,, The, Bride, With, White, Hair, is, nonetheless, filled, with, ultra-stylized,, gory,, head-scratching, mayhem., In, some, sense,, it, has, a, Romeo, and, Juliet, tinge, of, doomed, lovers,, if, those, lovers, had, the, ability, to, fly, and, attack, people, with, prehensile, hair., The, title, character, is, a, young, woman, who, undergoes, a, terrible, transformation, when, rejected, by, her, lover,, using, her, newfound, powers, to, seek, out, those, who, have, wronged, her., The, whole, thing, is, shot, in, a, very, gauzy, style, with, cold, colors, and, odd,, unnatural, lighting, that, makes, it, feel, like, an, especially, vivid, nightmare., It’s, a, film, that, waffles, between, silly, melodrama, and, even, sillier, action, at, the, drop, of, a, hat,, which, is, something, one, can, often, find, in, the, wuxia, martial, arts, subgenre, where, this, at, least, partially, resides., It’s, difficult, to, define,, but, wuxia, films, typically, feature, this, sort, of, mix, of, historical, swashbuckling, and, romance, over, the, training, and, fistfights, of, other, martial, arts, movies., —J.V., 81., Equilibrium, Year:, 2002, Director:, Kurt, Wimmer, In, Equilibrium,, Taye, Diggs, plays, a, future, fascist, law, enforcement, officer, named, Brandt,, and, near, the, climax, of, the, film,, Brandt, gets, his, face, cut, off., That’s, his, whole, face,, impeccably, separated, from, his, head,, hair-, to, jaw-line., This, follows, a, kind, of, lightning-quick,, future, samurai, sword, fight, in, which, Christian, Bale’s, character,, the, heroically, named, John, Preston,, has, singlehandedly, massacred, his, way,, gun, in, one, hand, and, sword, in, the, other,, through, one, law, enforcement, officer, after, another,, determined, to, wrench, humanity, from, the, binds, of, a, totalitarian, state, that, has, outlawed—you, guessed, it—feelings., Much, like, Taye, Diggs’, face,, Equilibrium, is, quite, pretty, in, its, action,, very, symmetrical., But, also, like, his, face,, the, fact, that, I, just, gave, away, a, meaty, part, of, the, climax, should, be, easily, disconnected, from, whether, or, not, you, should, still, watch, Equilibrium., You, should:, it’s, all, as, simultaneously, bonkers, and, well-mannered, as, the, moment, in, which, Taye, Diggs’, face, slides, off, the, front, of, his, head, like, salami, from, a, meat, slicer., —D.S., 80., The, Karate, Kid, Year:, 1984, Director:, John, G., Avildsen, Ralph, Macchio’s, crane-legged, Karate, Kid, would, become, an, icon, of, the, ’80s,, as, would, Pat, Morita, as, Mr., Miyagi,, the, sensei, who, trains, the, bullied, Daniel, LaRusso, in, martial, arts., Although, many, of, the, scenes, can, feel, a, little, worn, and, trope-laden,, that’s, mostly, due, to, how, much, the, film, has, been, copied, in, the, years, since, its, release., It, was, the, sort, of, feature, that, defined, karate, to, an, entire, generation, of, young, kids, and, must, have, inspired, countless, dojo, openings, and, yellow, belt, ceremonies., It, also, features, one, of, the, great, villains, of, ’80s, cinema, in, the, merciless, Cobra, Kai, coach,, Sensei, John, Kreese:, “Sweep, the, leg,, Johnny.”, —Josh, Jackson, 79., Kickboxer, Year:, 1989, Director:, Mark, DiSalle, and, David, Worth, Like, an, unofficial, sequel, to, 1988’s, Bloodsport—but, more, a, refining, than, a, new, adventure, for, that, movie’s, Frank, Dux, (Jean-Claude, Van, Damme)—Kickboxer, is, meatier,, meaner,, and, sweatier, than, its, comparatively, tame, predecessor., In, the, course, of, two, years,, Van, Damme, had, starred, in, four, action, films,, his, less, dependable, two, (Black, Eagle, and, the, confounding, Cyborg), sandwiched, between, a, pair, of, nearly, identical, films, that, pretty, much, soldered, Van, Damme’s, fully-formed, cinematic, persona, to, his, blocky,, unblemished,, well-bred, Belgian, forehead., It, could, be, said, that, every, Van, Damme, movie, is, pretty, much, one, Van, Damme, movie,, but, Kickboxer, claims, that, this, idea, isn’t, such, a, bad, one., If, time, is, just, a, flat, circle,, let, us, relish, the, moment, that, Van, Damme’s, mutantly, macho, Kurt, Sloane, high-kicks, the, smarmy, grin, off, the, face, of, psychotic, rapist, Tong, Po, (Michel, Qissi)—over, and, over, and, over, again,, as, if, it, were, only, the, first, time., —D.S., 78., The, Cave, of, Silken, Web, Year:, 1967, Director:, Ho, Meng, Hua, The, “martial, arts”, genre, has, room, for, all, kinds—serious, and, light-hearted,, mature, and, family, friendly., The, Cave, of, Silken, Web, is, technically, supposed, to, be, the, latter,, but, wow,, is, it, surreal, to, watch., A, take, on, the, famous, “Journey, to, the, West”, story, (which, will, come, up, again, on, this, list),, it’s, about, a, monk, on, a, long, journey, with, his, protectors,, who, include, a, pig, man, and, the, “Monkey, King,”, who, looks, pretty, much, as, you, would, expect., The, villains, are, spider, demons, who, take, the, guise, of, attractive, women, and, scheme, to, achieve, eternal, life, by, eating, the, pure, flesh, of, the, monk., There’s, even, a, musical, number, by, the, spider, women, about, how, they, can’t, wait, to, eat, this, guy—pretty, damn, weird, stuff,, but, oddly, compelling., Like, many, other, Shaw, Brothers, films, of, the, period,, the, production, values, are, actually, pretty, high, and, the, color, photography, really, pops., —J.V., 77., Best, of, the, Best, Year:, 1989, Director:, Bob, Radler, A, hilariously, sincere, American, cheese-fest,, Best, of, the, Best, is, essentially, Cool, Runnings,, except, the, stakes, are, a, life-and-death, martial, arts, tournament, against, that, evil, foreign, superpower, we, all, love, so, much:, Korea., It’s, a, story, about, an, American, team, of, martial, artists, thrown, together, from, the, dregs, of, society—“they’re, a, ragtag, bunch, of, misfits!”, There’s, the, street, fighter, from, Detroit,, the, guy, who’s, a, cowboy, for, some, reason,, the, grizzled, veteran/widower,, and,, of, course,, the, young, kid, seeking, vengeance, for, the, death, of, his, brother, at, the, hand, of, the, Korean, leader,, who,, I, shit, you, not,, wears, an, eyepatch, while, fighting., The, ending, in, particular, is, pure, schmaltz:, Rather, than, give, in, to, hate, and, kill, his, opponent, in, the, ring,, our, hero, lets, Team, Korea, win, to, keep, his, honor., And, then, the, Koreans, apologize,, hand, the, Americans, their, medals,, and, everyone, hugs, it, out., With, James, Earl, Jones, as, the, coach, who, yells, stuff!, —J.V., 76., Dragon, Lord, Year:, 1982, Director:, Jackie, Chan, By, 1982,, Jackie, Chan, was, fairly, well, known, to, Hong, Kong, audiences, as, an, ascendant, performer, who,, along, with, the, likes, of, Sammo, Hung,, was, introducing, a, new, dimension, of, comedic, martial, arts, films., An, absolutely, superior, athlete, and, stunt, coordinator,, he, had, already, starred, in, more, traditional, kung, fu, comedies, such, as, the, original, Drunken, Master,, and, was, now, experimenting, with, expanding, his, stunt, action, sequences, in, a, period, setting., The, fanatical, director, brought, an, insane, work, ethic, to, projects, such, as, Dragon, Lord,, which, quite, honestly, features, one, of, the, more, silly,, childlike, premises, in, the, genre’s, history:, Chan’s, character, gets, mixed, up, with, a, bunch, of, thugs, after, the, kite, he’s, flying, accidentally, gets, away, from, him, and, lands, in, their, headquarters., It’s, absolutely, absurd,, but, the, stunt, work, is, Chan, at, his, hyperkinetic, best., —J.V., 75., Dragon:, The, Bruce, Lee, Story, Year:, 1993, Director:, Rob, Cohen, The, details, of, Bruce, Lee’s, life, tend, to, be, contentious,, and, his, philosophies, interpreted, to, serve, the, ends, of, whomever, is, examining, them,, but, Dragon:, The, Bruce, Lee, Story, does, a, good, job, of, simply, celebrating, the, life, of, the, most, famous, martial, artist, of, all, time., Jason, Scott, Lee, is, inherently, likable, as, Bruce,, in, a, story, that, spans, from, his, childhood, to, his, time, in, the, United, States, and, breakthrough, on, American, television, in, The, Green, Hornet., The, film, is, unfortunately, tinged, with, tragedy,, both, from, Lee’s, death, at, 32, and, that, of, his, son, Brandon, at, 28, on, the, set, of, The, Crow,, only, two, months, before, its, release., Nevertheless,, it, was, received, well, and, manages, to, come, off, as, more, of, a, loving, tribute, than, an, attempt, to, profiteer, on, Lee’s, name., —J.V., 74., Dance, of, the, Drunk, Mantis, Year:, 1979, Director:, Yuen, Woo-ping, Sequel, structure, wasn’t, all, that, well-defined, in, kung, fu, cinema,, and, it, was, sometimes, difficult, to, tell, which, films, were, supposed, to, be, direct, references, to, others,, especially, for, American, audiences., Case, in, point:, Dance, of, the, Drunk, Mantis, is, essentially, a, sequel, of, sorts, to, the, classic, Drunken, Master,, not, because, Jackie, Chan’s, character, is, in, it, but, because, of, the, returning, Yuen, Siu-tien,, who, played, his, master,, Beggar, So., Turns, out,, this, guy, ran, out, on, his, family,, and, he, returns, to, find, a, new,, adoptive, son, called, “Foggy.”, When, a, challenger, shows, up, using, an, imposing, “Drunk, Mantis”, style, and, threatens, Beggar, So,, Foggy, has, to, learn, an, entirely, new, style, of, kung, fu, referred, to, as, “sickness, boxing”, to, counter, the, movements, of, the, unpredictable,, drunk-style, fighters., It’s, a, classic, showcase, of, drunken, kung, fu, movements, ,, which, always, strike, a, beautiful, balance, between, bawdy, humor, and, delicate, ballet., —J.V., 73., The, Last, Dragon, Year:, 1985, Director:, Michael, Schultz, The, Last, Dragon, is, the, funniest, martial, arts, movie, you’ve, likely, never, seen,, an, outrageous, blend, of, kung, fu, and, blaxploitation, movie, tropes, fused, into, the, tale, of, Bruce, Leroy,, the, titular, last, dragon., Underappreciated, in, its, day, as, a, hilarious, satire, on, multiple, genres,, the, film, has, now, become, a, bona, fide, cult, classic,, especially, for, the, amazing, villain, Sho’Nuff,, the, self-proclaimed, “Shogun, of, Harlem.”, There’s, no, other, way, to, say, it:, Sho’Nuff, is, one, of, the, greatest, film, villains, of, all, time., As, a, style, icon, and, source, of, one-liners,, few, can, compare., There’s, absolutely, nothing, serious, about, The, Last, Dragon,, but, for, students, of, the, genre, it’s, a, magical, diversion, for, a, movie, night, with, friends., —J.V., 72., Unleashed, Year:, 2005, Director:, Louis, Leterrier, In, his, second, go, directing, a, script, penned, by, futurist, action, maestro, Luc, Besson,, Louis, Leterrier, strikes, absurd, gold, by, telling, the, story, of, a, street-fighting, orphan, (Jet, Li), who’s, raised, by, the, mob, to, be, an, attack, dog., Wrapping, an, ageless, Li’s, neck, with, a, dog, collar, and, watching, the, veteran, Hong, Kong, star, medievally, pound, the, living, daylights, out, of, one, unfortunate, henchman, after, another,, Letterier, casts, Bob, Hoskins, as, the, mob, boss, behind, Li’s, enslavement;, Hoskins,, bless, him,, is, totally, devoted, to, the, boundless, evil, his, Irish, character, affords, him,, making, Jet, Li’s, fight—literally—for, his, freedom, a, truly, odd, thing, to, behold., In, classic, Besson, fashion,, unrelenting, fight, scenes, are, punctuated, by, painful, schmaltz,, but, what, compensates, for, a, lagging, middle, section—in, which, Li, learns, how, to, be, a, real, person, from, a, too-well-suited, Morgan, Freeman (playing, a, wise,, old, blind, man…seriously)—is, Li’s, surprisingly, touching, charm, as, the, socially, awkward, but, physically, unmatched, bearer, of, tragic, circumstances., Of, course,, in, the, wrong, light,, the, whole, thing, could’ve, been, an, offensive, fluke,, but, the, absolute, commitment, of, everyone, involved, elevates, Unleashed, to, the, status, of, overlooked,, undeniably, bat-shit, action, classic., —D.S., 71., Clan, of, the, White, Lotus, Year:, 1980, Director:, Lo, Lieh, Clan, of, the, White, Lotus, is, pure,, vintage, kung, fu,, and, excellent,, archetypal, film, that, is, only, bumped, down, the, list, slightly, because, it’s, practically, a, remake, of, the, earlier, Executioners, from, Shaolin, in, most, respects., The, great, Gordon, Liu, stars, as, a, monk, out, for, revenge, (naturally),, but, it’s, really, the, villain,, Priest, White, Lotus,, who, steals, the, show., Portrayed, by, director, Lo, Lieh,, he, projects, such, a, perfect, sense, of, menace, and, sheer, invincibility, that, Liu, has, to, train, in, multiple, new, and, inventive, styles, to, even, stand, a, chance., It’s, a, great, film, of, progression,, as, the, repeated, battles, between, the, two, show, the, evolution, in, Liu’s, technique, as, he, attempts, to, assail, the, stone, wall, that, is, White, Lotus., Visually,, it, looks, exactly, like, what, a, novice, would, picture, in, his, or, her, head, when, someone, says, “kung, fu, movie.”, —J.V., 70., The, Victim, Year:, 1980, Director:, Sammo, Hung, Kung, fu, movies, can, sometimes, come, off, as, weirdly, compartmentalized, between, humor, and, really, dramatic,, serious, action., Such, is, the, case, with, Sammo, Hung’s, The, Victim., In, typical, Hung, fashion,, he, plays, a, comedic, character, named, “Fatty”, who, indentures, himself, to, a, brave, martial, artist, after, the, guy, bests, him, in, combat., Fatty, is, merely, a, sidekick/comic, relief,, however—his, master, is, the, film’s, true, protagonist,, and, his, own, story, is, much, more, melodramatic,, revolving, around, the, woman, that, both, he, and, his, adoptive, brother,, a, gang, leader,, desire., When, she, commits, suicide, in, an, attempt, to, end, the, fighting, and, keep, everyone, safe,, they, end, up, in, an, epic,, knock-down,, drag-out, kung, fu, battle, that, ends, with, a, rather, spectacular, finishing, move—a, pro, wrestling-style, giant, swing., It’s, an, especially, gritty,, hard-hitting, confrontation., —J.V., 69., Last, Hurrah, For, Chivalry, Year:, 1979, Director:, John, Woo, Before, he, was, iconically, known, for, the, likes, of, Hard, Boiled, and, the, “gunkata”, genre,, director, John, Woo, dabbled, in, classical, kung, fu, and, wuxia, pictures., Many, of, the, themes, are, the, same,, though—killers, for, hire,, deception,, organized, crime, and, revelations, about, who, is, really, working, for, whom., Here, though,, instead, of, cops, and, robbers, it’s, swordsmen, and, kung, fu, masters., Last, Hurrah, For, Chivalry, is, definitely, a, film, that, leans, on, its, stuntwork, and, choreography, rather, than, any, story, of, particular, interest,, but, lovers, of, stage, combat, will, certainly, appreciate, the, fast, and, furious, swordplay., The, slashing, sound, effects, are, beyond, ridiculous,, but, that’s, to, be, expected,, and, the, creative, use, of, props, elevates, these, swordfights, to, a, sublime, level., —J.V., 68., Kung, Fu, Hustle, Year:, 2004, Director:, Stephen, Chow, Stephen, Chow, is, probably, the, biggest, name, in, martial, arts, comedy, since, the, days, of, Sammo, Hung,, and, Kung, Fu, Hustle, will, likely, remain, one, of, his, most, well-regarded, films, both, as, a, director, and, performer., Gleefully, kooky,, it, combines, occasional, song, and, dance, with, extremely, exaggerated, kung, fu, parody, in, telling, the, tale, of, a, young, man, who, ends, up, overthrowing, a, large, criminal, organization,, the, “Deadly, Axe, Gang.”, This, is, not, a, complex, film—rather,, it’s, simply, intended, as, popcorn, entertainment, at, its, most, absurd., The, action, has, no, basis, in, reality,, being, closer, to, a, real-world, depiction, of, Looney, Tune, physics., The, characters, are, broad, pastiches, and, references, to, famous, actors, from, the, genre’s, history, abound., With, comedy, that, teeters, decidedly, on, the, juvenile, or, inscrutable, side,, it’s, a, film, that, some, will, dismiss, off-hand,, but, Chow’s, style, has, always, and, will, probably, always, be, “entertain, first,, make, sense, later.”, That’s, what, he, does,, and, he, does, it, better, than, anyone, else., —J.V., 67., 2, Champions, of, Shaolin, Year:, 1980, Director:, Chang, Cheh, Another, Venom, Mob, film, by, Chang, Cheh,, except, this, one, comes, with, a, Shaolin, twist., It’s, one, of, the, few, Venom, films, to, star, burly, Lo, Mang, as, the, primary, hero,, although, he, still, perishes, at, the, end, as, he, seemingly, always, does, in, their, films., The, plot, revolves, around, two, warring, clans:, the, honorable, Shaolin, fighters, and, the, deplorable, Wu, Tangs,, who, use, seemingly, magical, throwing, knives, that, bend, the, hell, out, of, the, laws, of, aerodynamics., A, convoluted, series, of, alliances, and, allegiances, are, forged, and, tested,, leading, to, a, final, fight, that, goes, full, Hamlet, and, kills, pretty, much, everybody., It’s, bloody, good, fun, from, the, Shaw, Brothers, with, a, well-balanced, variety, of, action, elements, and, styles, that, don’t, run, too, strongly, in, any, one, direction., —J.V., 66., Mr., Vampire, Year:, 1985, Director:, Ricky, Lau, This, flick, will,, within, moments,, have, you, checking, your, drink, to, be, sure, you, haven’t, been, drugged., Responsible, for, first, bringing, the, so-called, jiangshi, subgenre, into, vogue,, Mr., Vampire, is, an, utterly, bizarre, but, compellingly, original, creation, that, blends, a, classic, kung, fu, movie, with, horror, and, elements, of, ancient, Chinese, folklore/mythology., The, vampires, in, question, (there’s, more, than, one), are, the, Eastern, variety, of, “hopping”, vamp,, which, move, by, holding, their, arms, straight, out, in, front, of, them, and, jumping, around, with, little, bunny, hops., Oh,, and, you, can, repel, them, by, holding, your, breath., The, movie, is, a, cinematic, fever, dream,, which, a, few, seconds, of, the, trailer,, with, its, flying, heads, and, hopping, vampires,, should, make, abundantly, clear., —J.V., 65., The, Transporter, Year:, 2002, Director:, Louis, Leterrier, Before, The, Transporter,, Jason, Statham, was, more, cockney, thug, than, lithe, action, beast,, but, after, The, Transporter, came, the, frenetic, shitstorm, of, Crank,, followed, by, War,, which, pitted, him, against, none, other, than, Jet, Li—so, we, can, pretty, much, thank, Louis, Leterrier, for, believing, in, Statham’s, martial, arts, prowess, enough, to, give, him, both, the, right, playground, to, inhabit, and, the, license, to, take, it, apart., Imagine, him, a, gruffer, cousin, to, Jean-Claude, Van, Damme,, just, as, given, to, finding, himself, shirtless,, but, more, apt, to, preserve, his, mopey, loner, status—at, least, until, some, beautiful, upstart, maiden, enters, his, life, and, throws, herself, at, him., In, that, sense,, Statham’s, Frank, Martin, is, the, ideal, distillation, of, Eastern, martial, arts, archetypal, heroes, into, the, glossy, neons, of, a, Western, action, spectacle:, soundless,, sexless, and, merciless,, his, physicality, leaves, no, room, for, personality., Watch, only, the, scene, in, which, Frank, tip-toes, on, bicycle, pedals, through, an, oil, slick,, roundhousing, every, dumb, face, in, his, impressive, radius, to, propel, body, after, body, away, on, inky, skids,, to, witness, a, lovable, killing, machine, portrayed, in, as, empirical—as, perfect—a, way, as, we, can, ever, expect, out, of, The, Transporter’s, more, traditional, Asian, forebears., —D.S., 64., Bloodsport, Year:, 1988, Director:, Newt, Arnold, There, are, tomes, to, be, written, and, classes, to, be, taught, on, the, perplexing, existence, of, Bloodsport,, but, perhaps, the, film, is, best, summarized, in, one, moment:, the, infamous, Scream., Because, in, these, 40, seconds, or, so,, the, heart, and, soul, of, Bloodsport, is, bared, with, little, concern, for, taste,, or, purpose,, or, respect, for, the, physically, binding, laws, of, reality—in, this, moment, is, a, burgeoning, movie, star, channeling, his, best, attributes, (astounding, muscles;, years, of, suppressed, rage;, the, juxtaposition, of, grace, and, violence, that, is, his, well-oiled, and, cleanly, shaven, corporeal, form), to, make, a, go, at, real-live, Hollywood acting., Although, Bloodsport, is, the, movie, that, announced, Jean-Claude, Van, Damme, and, his, impenetrable, accent, to, the, world—as, well, as, serving, as, the, crucible, for, (seriously), every, single, plot, of, every, Van, Damme, movie, to, come—it’s, also, a, defining, film, of, the, decade,, positioning, martial, arts, as, certifiable, blockbuster, action, cinema., Schwarzenegger, and, Stallone?, These, were, beefy, mooks, that, could, believably, be, action, stars., Van, Damme, set, the, bar, higher:, his, body, became, a, better, and, bloodier, weapon, than, any, hand-cannon, that, previous, mumbling,, ’80s, box-office, draws, could, ever, wield., —D.S., 63., Sister, Street, Fighter, Year:, 1974, Director:, Kazuhiko, Yamaguchi, Sister, Street, Fighter, is, the, second, sequel, to, Sonny, Chiba’s, The, Street, Fighter,, and, in, truth, it, may, actually, be, more, exciting,, if, not, more, iconic., Chiba, appears, in, the, film, in, a, supporting, role, instead, of, as, his, Terry, Tsurugi, character, from, the, first, two, films,, but, the, actual, star, of, the, show, is, Sue, Shiomi, as, Tina,, a, young, woman, searching, for, her, missing, brother,, a, drug, agent, who, goes, missing, while, investigating, a, criminal, organization., It’s, a, classic, team-up, as, Chiba, and, Shiomi’s, characters, infiltrate, the, organization, and, set, up, a, final, battle, with, the, villain,, who, uses, a, claw, weapon, in, seeming, imitation, of, the, villain, from, Bruce, Lee’s, Enter, the, Dragon., Simply, a, satisfying, story, with, a, fittingly, high, body, count,, it, features, a, wide, array, of, martial, art, styles, in, the, villain’s, stable, of, hired, killers,, which, make, for, an, action-packed, conclusion., —J.V., 62., Kung, Fu, Panda, Year:, 2008, Director:, John, Stevenson, Kung, Fu, Panda, isn’t, just, a, good, movie—it’s, a, good, kung, fu, movie., The, title, isn’t, pandering,, because, the, film, truly, respects, its, source, material., Jack, Black’s, character, may, as, well, be, Sammo, Hung, or, Jackie, Chan, in, one, of, his, early, roles., All, of, the, classical, elements, are, there—an, obnoxious, pupil, who, becomes, a, fighting, machine., A, team, of, (literally), animal-based, martial, artists, with, varying, styles., An, unbeatable,, rampaging, villain, in, the, vein, of, Ghost-Faced, Killer., And, a, secret, technique, that, the, hero, needs, to, learn, in, order, to, conquer, that, villain., It’s, a, funny,, vibrant, film, as, easily, enjoyed, by, children, as, adults,, and, one, that, the, adult, viewers, should, feel, no, embarrassment, for, enjoying, as, much, as, they, do., If, you, like, classical, martial, arts, filmmaking,, Kung, Fu, Panda, is, probably, the, most, faithful, animated, twist, on, the, genre, that, anyone, has, pulled, off, so, far., Too, bad, the, same, can’t, be, said, of, its, overblown, sequel., —J.V., 61., Man, of, Tai, Chi, Year:, 2013, Director: Keanu, Reeves , It’s, still, a, phrase, that, lodges, in, the, throat:, “Director:, Keanu, Reeves.”, But, for, anyone, who, left, John, Wick, loose-limbed, and, exhausted, due, to, the, sheer, grace, of, Reeves’, action, chops,, it, should, come, as, absolutely, no, surprise, that, the, man—the, one, and, only, Neo—can, direct, the, fuck, out, of, a, martial, arts, movie., With, little, frills,, barely, a, plot,, a, Tai, Chi, phenom, in, Tiger, Chen, (who, also, served, as, Reeves’, teacher, and,, for, Kill, Bill,, Uma, Thurman’s, stunt, double),, a, strong, woman, character, who, seems, smarter, than, all, the, ’roided-out, dudes, beating, each, other, senseless, surrounding, her,, and, Reeves’, ever-present, sonic, mangling, of, the, English, language,, Man, of, Tai, Chi, is, pretty, much, exactly, what, the, title, suggests:, an, exhilarating,, inertial, obsession, both, with, movement, as, art, as, power, and, with, those, who, wield, it, inimitably., Testament, to, Reeves’s, intelligence, as, a, self-didact, who, just, wants, to, do, right, by, those, folks, who, put, their, trust, in, him, over, the, course, of, his, many-decade, career,, Man, of, Tai, Chi, is, exactly, what, you, most, hoped, for, when, you, first, saw, who, directed, it., That, it’s, awesome, is, surprising—and, it’s, even, better, for, that., —D.S., 60., Kiss, of, the, Dragon, Year:, 2001, Director:, Chris, Nahon, Jet, Li, was, a, Hong, Kong, superstar, who, came, across, the, sea, to, America,, likely, with, hopes, of, a, Jackie, Chan-like, career, trajectory, in, his, mind., However,, after, a, few, poorly, received, American, films, such, as, Romeo, Must, Die,, it, became, clear, he, probably, wouldn’t, be, that, sort, of, crossover, star., Kiss, of, the, Dragon, brought, things, back, down, to, Earth, a, bit,, in, a, John, Woo-style, feature, starring, Li, as, a, Chinese, intelligence, agent, hunting, for, a, drug, lord, in, Paris., Of, his, American, films,, it, probably, relies, the, least, on, CGI, or, wirework,, although, some, is, clearly, evident, in, what, is, likely, the, film’s, most, famous, moment—when, a, pinned-down, Li, kicks, a, pool, ball, out, of, the, pocket, and, again, in, mid-air, to, disarm, a, gunman., The, rest, of, the, action, is, fast-paced, and, violent,, mixing, gunplay, and, a, greater, than, average, prevalence, of, broken, necks., —J.V., 59., The, Prodigal, Son, Year:, 1981, Director:, Sammo, Hung, Another, film, directed, by, Sammo, Hung,, Prodigal, Son, reins, in, the, comedy, for, once, to, present, a, unique, story, about, privileged, children, and, the, price, of, true, knowledge., Yuen, Biao, stars, as, Chang,, the, son, of, a, wealthy, man, who, believes, himself, to, be, a, kung, fu, master., However,, because, he, lacks, any, real, skill,, his, father, has, clandestinely, been, bribing, all, of, his, opponents, to, lose., When, the, ruse, is, revealed,, Chang, must, join, up, with, a, traveling, circus, troupe, and, its, Wing, Chun-employing, leader, to, learn, true, kung, fu., It’s, a, more, mature, turn, from, Hung,, who, co-stars, as, one, of, Chang’s, tutors,, and, the, action, choreography, is, expansive,, free-flowing, and, beautiful., With, that, said,, the, guy, with, no, eyebrows, still, sort, of, creeps, me, out., —J.V., 58., The, Raid, 2:, Berendal, Year:, 2014, Director:, Gareth, Evans, Nearly, five, years, in, gestation,, The, Raid, 2, feels, like, the, exact, kind, of, movie, that, Gareth, Evans, has, always, dreamed, of, making., Or…scratch, that:, this, is, the, kind, of, movie, that, every, fan, of, martial, arts, cinema, has, always, dreamed, of, watching—the, pure, and, unhindered, manifestation, of, brutal, hand-to-hand, action, shot, with, unrepentantly, magnanimous, scope., Where, the, original, film, exposed, the, world, to, a, rapid-fire, form, of, Indonesian, martial, arts, called, Pencak, silat,, The, Raid, 2, made, that, style, of, fighting, the, only, key, to, survival, in, a, society, on, the, verge, of, total, nihilism., Expanding, from, an, occupied, office, building, to, the, whole, of, the, criminal, underworld,, The, Raid, 2, takes, the, surviving, characters, from, the, first, film, and, pushes, them, toward, a, tragic, and/or, exhausted, end., Practically, every, scene, is, the, result, of, filmmaking, bravura,, but, perhaps, the, most, trenchant, is, one, in, which, hero, Rama, (Iko, Uwais),, barely, holding, himself, together, after, hours, of, fighting,, walks, slowly, back, through, the, now-quiet, graveyard, of, defeated, bodies, he, left, in, his, wake, not, long, before., It’s, a, humbling, moment,, that, the, calm, after, the, storm, is, just, a, sad, reflection, on, all, the, pain, inflicted, during, the, storm, itself., Self-aware, and, yet, unstoppable, despite, that,, The, Raid, 2, is, a, new, standard, for, action, cinema., —D.S., 57., Knockabout, Year:, 1979, Director:, Sammo, Hung, Knockabout, is, like, the, perfect, template, of, a, Sammo, Hung, movie:, Simple,, crowd-pleasing,, good-natured, and, infinitely, rewatchable,, like, martial, arts, comfort, food., Hung, directs, and, co-stars, as, a, “fat, beggar,”, very, much, in, the, vein, of, Drunken, Master’s, Beggar, So,, without, the, intoxication., Really,, though,, Knockabout, is, truly, the, Yuen, Biao, appreciation, film—one, of, the, “Seven, Little, Fortunes”, that, included, Jackie, Chan, and, Hung,, Biao, is, beloved, by, genre, fans, but, not, nearly, well, known, enough, to, the, wider, world,, which, is, a, real, shame., Like, Chan,, his, lithe, athleticism, and, comedic, chops, make, him, instantly, likable,, but, in, terms, of, physicality, he, might, be, an, even, more, acrobatic, (if, not, intimidating), fighter., Here,, he’s, training, with, Hung, in, order, to, hunt, down, the, man, who, killed, his, brother, (fresh, idea!),, but, hey,, it, gives, us, an, excuse, for, some, great, training, sequences, featuring, monkey, style, kung, fu, and, the, amazingly, acrobatic, jump, rope, sequence., It’s, the, kind, of, thing, you, never, see, in, modern, martial, arts, films,, and, this, kind, of, pure, athletic, showmanship, is, sorely, missed., —J.V., 56., Red, Cliff, Year:, 2008, Director:, John, Woo, When, we, think, of, John, Woo,, we, tend, to, think, of, gun, ballads, and, Chow, Yun-Fat., We’re, not, wired, to, think, of, large-scale, portrayals, of, warfare,, much, less, period, dramas, set, during, the, end, of, the, Han, Dynasty., Magnolia, split, the, film, more, or, less, in, twain, for, its, U.S., release;, you, won’t, find, the, full, 288-minute, version, on, Netflix Instant,, but, Red, Cliff, feels, complete, even, with, roughly, half, its, content, rotting, on, the, cutting, floor., This, is, a, towering, film,, one, that’s, filled, with, allusion, and, metaphor,, stratagem, and, scheming,, sentimentality, and, philosophy,, and, eye-popping, battle, sequences, that, afford, Woo, plenty, of, room, to, harmonize, historical, accuracy, with, the, signature, flourishes, that, make, him, an, action, maestro., —Andy, Crump, 55., The, Invincible, Armour, Year:, 1977, Director:, See-Yuen, Ng, The, plot, of, The, Invincible, Armour, is, a, bit, on, the, inscrutable, side,, revolving, around, assassination, and, people, being, framed, for, various, crimes,, but, none, of, that, really, matters, because, the, majority, is, spent, indulging, in, some, cheesy, kung, fu, goodness., The, key, technique, here, is, “iron, armour,”, a, method, of, hardening, and, toughening, the, body, to, shrug, off, blows., There’s, lots, of, great, training, sequences, and, montages, of, both, the, heroes, and, villains, employing, these, techniques,, whether, it’s, dipping, themselves, in, boiling, water,, headbutting, spiked, balls, on, chains, or, simply, reclining, onto, spear, points,, which, the, trailer, reminds, us, is, “exciting, and, fantastic!”, The, fact, that, the, villain’s, single, weak, point, turns, out, to, be, his, groin, makes, for, an, especially, hilarious, conclusion, that, literally, involves, his, junk, being, crushed, ...TO, DEATH!, Accompanied, by, helpful, visual, metaphors., —J.V., 54., Snake, in, the, Eagle’s, Shadow, Year:, 1978, Director:, Yuen, Woo-ping, The, directorial, debut, of, influential, director/choreographer, Yuen, Woo-ping,, Snake, in, the, Eagle’s, Shadow, was, also, one, of, Jackie, Chan’s, first, starring, roles,, predating, his, star-making, turn, in, Drunken, Master., Chan, plays, an, orphan, adopted, into, a, kung, fu, school,, where, he, is, abused, and, beaten, up, by, the, teachers, and, students, regularly, until, a, beggar, teaches, him, snake-style, kung, fu., He, then, becomes, a, champion/defender, of, the, school, before, being, roped, into, a, plot, by, eagle-claw, kung, fu, practitioners, to, kill, off, all, the, snake-style, users., In, short,, it’s, classic, kung, fu, stuff,, very, much, about, battles, between, iconic, styles—mantis-style, users, also, show, up, for, a, fight, at, one, point., Chan, hadn’t, quite, gotten, into, his, comedic, period, yet,, and, it’s, fascinating, to, see, the, young, performer, (24, years, old, at, the, time), at, his, physical, best,, but, still, sitting, on, plenty, of, untapped, potential., —J.V., 53., Shaolin, Year:, 2011, Director:, Benny, Chan, It’s, pretty, rare, that, one, can, look, back, on, the, history, of, a, genre,, pick, out, a, classic, style, of, film,, and, say,, “Let’s, lovingly, recreate, it, as, it, would, have, been, made, in, the, modern, era.”, Look, at, horror:, How, well, did, that, work, for, Van, Helsing, or, The, Wolfman?, But, Shaolin, somehow, manages, to, pull, that, off,, a, modern, revitalization, of, the, classic, “Shaolin, temple”, film, subtype., It, integrates, tropes,, such, as, a, man, on, the, run, begging, entry, into, the, temple,, with, the, expected, training, sequences, established, by, The, 36th, Chamber, of, Shaolin., But, it, also, gets, the, best, it, can, from, its, modern, effects, budget,, and, features, Jackie, Chan, in, the, most, sensible, way, one, can, use, him, in, the, 2010s,, which, is, as, fluid, comic, relief., This, is, the, kind, of, premise, that, could, have, simply, felt, like, nostalgia, or, a, cash-grab,, but, is, pulled, off, with, excitement, and, reverence, in, equal, measure., —, —J.V., 52., Fearless, Year:, 2006, Director:, Ronny, Yu, After, his, somewhat, underwhelming, Hollywood period,, Jet, Li, returned, to, Hong, Kong, to, pull, off, his, last, great, historical, kung, fu, film,, Fearless., One, can, tell, that, the, story, of, Huo, Yuanjia,, a, martial, artist, who, triumphed, over, a, variety, of, international, fighters, at, a, time, when, China’s, national, identity, was, flagging,, is, an, important, one, to, him., Fittingly,, Li, imparts, one, of, his, best, acting, performances, to, the, film,, which, tells, the, tale, of, how, Yuanjia, learned, his, skills, and, realizes, he, must, stand, up, for, his, nation’s, reputation., The, film, ends, with, a, great,, tragic, fight, sequence, as, Yuanjia, takes, on, an, honorable, Japanese, swordsman, but, is, simultaneously, poisoned, by, scheming, aristocrats., The, choreography, is, beautiful, but, appreciably, restrained, in, reality,, which, was, rare, to, see, in, a, high-budget, film, in, the, years, following, Crouching, Tiger,, Hidden, Dragon., —J.V., 51., Chocolate, Year:, 2008, Director:, Prachya, Pinkaew, Chocolate, is, a, pretty, odd, premise, that, succeeds, because, the, action, is, just, so, good., One, might, summarize, it, thusly:, “It’s, like, Rain, Man,, except, with, more, muy, thai.”, As, in,, the, lead, character, is, an, autistic, savant,, except, instead, of, counting, toothpicks,, her, talents, mostly, lay, in, kicking, people, in, the, face., Casting, is, critical, to, its, success;, lead, Yanin, “Jeeja”, Vismistananda, is, an, ostensibly, adorable, waif,, which, makes, her, appear, as, a, most, unlikely, butt-kicker., After, a, childhood, spent, mnemonically, absorbing, martial, arts, movies,, however,, she, turns, into, a, tool, of, vengeance, unleashed, upon, the, gangster, threatening, her, mother., The, fight, scenes, are, over-the-top, ridiculous, but, thankfully, wireless,, which, makes, for, a, stylish,, exuberant, film., —J.V., 50., Executioners, From, Shaolin, Year:, 1977, Director:, Lau, Kar-leung, If, you, remember, the, story, of, Pai, Mei,, the, white, lotus,, that, David, Carradine, tells, to, Uma, Thurman, around, the, campfire, in, Kill, Bill,, then, you, essentially, know, the, story, of, this, film., Tarantino’s, double-film, is, filled, to, the, brim, with, references, to, classic, kung, fu, cinema,, not, least, of, which, is, Gordon, Liu’s, Pai, Mei, character,, who, is, an, absolutely, iconic, villain, in, Executioners, from, Shaolin., A, true, monster,, he, butchers, the, monks, of, the, Shaolin, Temple, with, his, nigh-invincibility,, and, is, only, brought, down, eventually, by, characters, who, have, trained, for, decades, specifically, to, find, his, few, vulnerabilities., Pai, Mei’s, mastery, of, his, bodily, functions,, referred, to, as, “internal, kung, fu,”, make, him, one, of, the, most, imposing, villains, in, the, history, of, the, genre,, and, make, this, film, a, classic, element, of, the, genre’s, lore., Bonus:, Gordon, Liu, appears, as, a, badass, monk, in, the, beginning, who, sacrifices, himself, against, a, small, army, of, fighters, to, help, his, Shaolin, brothers, escape., —J.V., 49., 3, Evil, Masters,, aka, The, Master, Year:, 1980, Director:, Chin-Ku, Lu, This, is, a, film, that, feels, a, bit, smaller, in, scope, that, some, of, the, other, Shaw, Bros., epics, on, the, list,, with, a, smaller, overall, cast, of, characters, and, a, bit, less, pageantry,, but, the, story, and, action, are, both, wonderful., The, plot, concerns, a, kung, fu, school, being, taken, over, by, the, titular, three, evil, masters,, each, of, whom, has, weird,, distinctive, stylistic, flourishes., The, protagonist, is, your, typical, young, pupil, who, needs, to, learn, a, variety, of, techniques, if, he’s, going, to, set, things, right, at, the, school., A, variety, of, dependable,, familiar, performers, appear,, particularly, Chen, Kuan, Tai,, who, has, a, great, early, scene, where, he, fights, all, three, of, the, evil, masters, at, once., I, particularly, love, the, guy, in, green,, who, uses, his, long, braid, of, hair, as, a, whip, throughout, the, fight., Dude, smashes, through, a, table, with, his, hair!, Watch, that, clip, and, simply, appreciate, the, long,, uninterrupted, take, that, begins, at, 3:30,, it’s, a, thing, of, beauty., —J.V., 48., Kill, Zone, –, SPL, Year:, 2005, Director:, Wilson, Yip, “SPL”, stands, for, San, Po, Lang,, three, characters, from, Chinese, astrology, that,, depending, on, their, alignment, in, the, heavens,, can, foretell, both, good, and, evil, tidings., So, proceeds, Kill, Zone,, a, prototypical, Hong, Kong, crime, flick, that,, like, any, salient, martial, arts, hybrid, post-2000,, devolves, into, the, shady, moral, gray, of, umpteen, different, action, genres, to, prove, a, point, about, the, malleable, nature, of, our, modern, moral, compass., Namely:, all, signs, point, to, nothing—no, hope,, no, love,, no, redemption;, violence, only, begets, more, violence,, and, every, action, has, an, equal, but, opposite, reaction., It’s, no, major, revelation, plot-wise,, but, when, director, Yip, pulls, in, veteran, Sammo, Hung, to,, despite, the, girth, of, age,, weave, circles, of, devastation, around, thugs, half, his, age,, everything, feels, exactly, as, it, should., Then,, cue, Donnie, Yen,, who, will, later, play, the, definitive, Ip, Man,, here, a, whirlwind, of, limbs, in, a, brutal, knife, vs., baton, alley, fight., In, its, final, moments,, Kill, Zone’s, scorched, earth, policy, leaves, only, the, innocent, alive;, maybe, this, is, how, every, martial, arts, movie, should, end., —D.S., 47., Way, of, the, Dragon,, aka, Return, of, the, Dragon, Year:, 1972, Director:, Bruce, Lee, Way, of, the, Dragon, stands, as, the, only, film, that, Bruce, Lee, ever, finished, directorial, duties, on,, passing, away, before, he, could, complete, The, Game, of, Death, or, the, co-credit, he, might, have, shared, on, Enter, the, Dragon., It, stands,, therefore,, as, perhaps, the, most, accurate, and, complete, piece, of, work, that, Lee, personally, envisioned,, a, story, about, a, Hong, Kong, fighter, who, travels, to, Rome, in, order, to, protect, a, family, restaurant, being, threatened, by, the, mob., As, one, would, expect,, it, has, some, great, fights,, but, nobody, has, quite, the, same, presence, on, camera, as, Lee., If, there’s, one, thing, most, viewers, would, take, away, from, this, one, today,, it’s, the, fact, that, this, film, contains, one, of, the, holy, grails, of, martial, arts, battles:, Bruce, Lee, vs., Chuck, Norris,, the, final, opponent,, which, takes, place, among, the, ruins, of, the, Roman, Colosseum., That, classic, fight, is, no, doubt, worth, the, price, of, admission, alone—just, feel, the, tension, as, both, of, them, warm, up, and, crack, their, knuckles, before, the, battle, begins., —J.V., 46., Five, Fingers, of, Death, Year:, 1972, Director:, Chang-hwa, Chung, Enter, the, Dragon, is, often, the, martial, arts, film, cited, as, being, the, start, of, the, kung, fu, craze, in, America,, but, in, reality, it, was, Five, Fingers, of, Death, that, kickstarted, the, genre, in, the, U.S., a, year, earlier, as, an, unexpected, drive-in, hit., As, such,, the, dubbed, version, at, least, is, a, little, more, naive, in, its, presentation, and, attitude, toward, the, martial, arts,, treated, with, a, sort, of, aloof,, mystic, reverence., At, it’s, core, though,, there’s, an, excellent, story, here,, starring, the, great, Lo, Lieh, as, a, young, pupil, who, shuffles, between, masters, as, he, attempts, to, learn, the, necessary, skills, to, defeat, a, local, tyrant, and, win, the, hand, of, the, girl, he, loves., It, proved, extremely, influential—once, again,, Kill, Bill, borrows, elements, here,, in, particular, its, instantly, recognizable, battle, music,, which, was, itself, lifted, from, the, 1967, TV, series, Ironside., Perhaps, most, importantly,, films, like, this, one, paved, the, way, for, martial, arts, cinema, to, soon, explode, into, crossover, popularity, in, the, U.S.,, with, Bruce, Lee, as, the, standard-bearer., —J.V., 45., Flash, Point, Year:, 2007, Director:, Wilson, Yip, Flash, Point, could, probably, have, gotten, away, with, spending, its, whole, running, time, simmering, through, its, central, cat-and-mouse, crime, yarn,, so, long, as, it, still, ended, with, Donnie, Yen, and, Collin, Chou, beating, the, tar, out, of, each, other., Theirs, is, a, brawl, for, the, ages,, a, knock-down,, drag-out, scrap, between, two, titans, of, the, martial, arts, genre, that, holds, back, nothing, in, the, brutality, department., Luckily, for, us,, Wilson, Yip, makes, the, rest, of, Flash, Point, just, as, propulsive, and, exciting, as, its, climax,, but, the, film’s, real, draw, lies, in, seeing, its, two, biggest, stars, lock, horns, in, one, cataclysmic, struggle.—A.C., 44., Journey, to, the, West:, Conquering, the, Demons, Year:, 2013, Director:, Stephen, Chow, and, Derek, Kwok, Every, list, of, this, nature, needs, a, lot, of, Chow., Although, the, Hong, Kong, director’s, Western, breakthrough,, the, bonkers, Shaolin, Soccer,, gives, you, a, good, idea, of, what’s, on, the, director’s, mind,, the, even, bonkers-ier, Journey, to, the, West, is, a, better, place, to, start., Monumentally, popular, in, China,, breaking, all-time, box, office, records, (even, beating, out, Transformers, 4,, so, you, know, this, shit, means, business),, Journey, is, based, on, a, Chinese, literary, classic, of, the, same, name,, but, saturated, with, Chow’s, now, infamous, wit,, slapstick, and, barely, containable, glee, at, the, possibility, of, fantasy, filmmaking., Every, scene, is, an, elaborate, tour, de, force, of, stunts, and, battles, and, exaggerated, athleticism—just, like, every, scene, in, every, film, of, his, to, come, before—but, Journey, takes, that, extra, step, to, imbue, its, traditional, genre, tropes, with, grotesquerie, and, phantasmagorical, imagination,, transforming, a, pretty, basic, story, about, one, monk’s, path, to, enlightenment, into, Terry, Gilliam’s, wet, dream,, replete, with, pig, monsters, and, monkey, spirits, and, steampunk, and, practically, everything, in, between., So, much, more, than, a, martial, arts, flick,, this, feels, like, a, super-gifted, filmmaker, doing, exactly, what, he, was, born, to, do., —D.S., 43., The, Big, Boss,, aka, Fists, of, Fury, Year:, 1971, Director:, Lo, Wei, This, is, where, it, all, started, for, a, young, man, named, Bruce, Lee,, his, first, starring, vehicle, in, a, Hong, Kong, action, movie., Set, in, contemporary, time,, this, isn’t, some, Shaolin, temple, period, piece, but, a, pretty, grimy,, modern, crime, movie, that, just, happens, to, feature, some, martial, arts., James, Tien, was, ostensibly, supposed, to, be, the, film’s, star, power,, but, it, was, clear, that, Bruce, Lee, had, a, magnetism, that, made, him, lightning, in, a, bottle—you, can’t, look, away, when, he’s, on, screen., The, action, isn’t, quite, fully, developed,, but, you, can, just, see, the, raw,, seething, potential, in, him,, both, as, an, actor, and, the, most, famous, martial, artist, who’s, ever, lived., The, film, is, more, than, a, little, goofy, and, its, low-budgetness, can, make, it, a, little, bit, tougher, to, watch, today,, but, it’s, worthwhile, to, see, the, birth, of, the, legend., —J.V., 42., The, Brave, Archer, Year:, 1977, Director:, Chang, Cheh, The, Brave, Archer, is, a, true, martial, arts, epic, by, Chang, Cheh, and, the, Shaws,, taking, full, advantage, of, a, large, budget, and, access, to, expansive,, lavish, sets., Long, and, sprawling,, it’s, pretty, hard, to, sum, up, in, only, a, few, sentences,, but, suffice, to, say, it, centers, around, a, young, man, played, by, the, great, Alexander, Fu, Sheng, who, searches, for, several, parts, of, a, mystical, kung, fu, manual, while, also, competing, against, another, suitor, for, the, affections, of, a, woman, he, has, loved, his, whole, life., There, are, dozens, of, characters,, and, the, film, feels, a, bit, like, a, “best-of”, genre, piece,, with, many, recognizable, faces, who, pass, through, and, play, bit, parts., Probably, best-suited, to, viewers, who, are, well-steeped, in, the, kung, fu, genre, in, particular,, it’s, an, iconic, adventure, film, that, spawned, multiple, sequels, before, the, tragic, death, of, Fu, Sheng, in, a, car, crash, at, only, 28, years, old., He, was, truly, a, talent, taken, before, his, time,, but, The, Brave, Archer, stands, as, a, testament, to, his, skills, as, a, performer., —J.V., 41., The, Matrix, Year:, 1999, Director:, Andy, Wachowski, and, Lana, Wachowski, There, is, not, much, to, say, about, the, film, that, made, cyberpunk, not, stupid,, or, that, made, Keanu, Reeves a, respectable, figure, of, American, kung, fu,, or, that, finally, made, martial, arts, films, a, seriously, hot, commodity, outside, of, Asia., The, Matrix, is—next, to, the, Wu-Tang, Clan—what, proved, to, a, new, generation, that, martial, arts, films, were, worth, their, scrutiny,, and, in, that, reputation, is, bred, college, classes,, heroes’, journeys,, and, impossible, expectations, for, special, effects., While, there, are, plenty, better,, there, is, no, movie, in, the, canon, of, martial, arts, films, bigger, than, The, Matrix,, and, even, today, we, still, have, this, film, to, thank, for, so, much, of, what, we, love, about, modern, kinetic, cinema., This, is, our, red, pill;, everything, else, is, an, illusion, of, greatness, and, everything, else, is, an, allusion, to, what, the, Wachowskis, accomplished., —D.S., 40., Legendary, Weapons, of, China, Year:, 1982, Director:, Lau, Kar-leung, This, film, is, a, bit, of, a, storytelling, Gordian, knot,, but, all, of, the, interconnected, plots, means, tons, of, colorful, characters, and, combat., The, main, plot, revolves, around, a, group, of, “spiritual, boxers”, martial, artists, attempting, to, train, their, bodies, to, resist, the, bullets, of, Western, imperialist, guns., These, villains, are, also, hunting, down, former, members, of, the, group, who, have, since, admitted, that, stopping, a, bullet, by, flexing, your, abs, probably, isn’t, possible., The, real, attraction, is, the, incredible, array, of, styles:, Ti, Tan, the, impenetrable, monk, played, by, Gordon, Liu,, Maoshan, “magic, boxers”, and, more., And, as, if, that’s, not, enough,, you, also, have, the, reason, for, the, title:, This, film, highlights, the, styles, and, uses, of, traditional, Chinese, weaponry, better, than, any, other, on, the, list., There’s, 18, different, weapons, in, total, that, are, featured,, many, during, the, epic, final, scene, where, the, hero, and, villain, cycle, through, all, of, the, legendary, weapons, as, they, probe, the, strengths, and, weaknesses, of, each, bit, of, armament., It’s, one, of, the, only, scenes, of, its, kind,, and, it’s, magnificent., —J.V., 39., Dragon, Gate, Inn, Year:, 1967, Director:, King, Hu, An, influential, film, that, one, might, call, the, birth, of, the, modern, wuxia, epic,, Dragon, Gate, Inn, was, actually, made, in, Taiwan,, despite, being, set, in, historical, China., It’s, a, story, of, family,, as, several, orphaned, children, of, a, deposed, general, are, on, the, run, from, a, band, of, hired, killers., As, they, flee, for, the, country’s, borders,, a, trap, is, waiting, for, them, at, the, Dragon, Gate, Inn., But, when, a, brother-sister, team, of, martial, artist, allies, arrive,, they, help, even, the, odds, for, the, refugees., The, action, is, stylish, and, heavy, on, the, swordplay., I’ve, always, been, amused, by, this, scene, in, particular,, when, a, bevy, of, four, swordsman, try, to, overwhelm, the, old, master, by, running, around, him, in, a, circle, in, order, to, disorient, him., —J.V., 38., Wing, Chun, Year:, 1994, Director:, Yuen, Woo-ping, Michelle, Yeoh, would, become, well-known, six, years, later, with, the, release, of, cross-cultural, smash, hit, Crouching, Tiger,, Hidden, Dragon,, but, she, was, a, star, in, martial, arts, cinema, from, the, 1980s, onward,, and, Wing, Chun, is, one, of, the, best, overall, star, vehicles, for, her, great, physical, (and, comedic), talents., Tonally,, it’s, sort, of, an, unusual, film,, as, much, romantic, comedy, as, it, is, martial, arts, movie,, but, without, sacrificing, the, gravitas, of, the, action, sequences., It, manages, to, be, both, charming,, as, the, story, of, a, country, woman, protecting, her, village,, and, a, thrilling, collection, of, set-pieces, largely, practical, in, their, special, effects., It’s, hard, not, to, fall, in, love, a, little, bit, with, Yeoh, by, the, end—she’s, as, beautiful, as, she, is, talented., —J.V., 37., Riki-Oh:, The, Story, of, Ricky, Year:, 1991, Director:, Lam, Nai-choi, Adapted, from, a, Japanese, manga, and, one, of, the, few, films, on, this, list, that, should, definitely, not, be, watched, in, its, original, language,, Riki-Oh, is, a, hallucinatory, smorgasbord, of, flying, viscera, and, exploding, bone, fragments—either, a, deadpan, attempt, to, translate, gratuitous, comic, book, violence, to, the, screen,, and, thereby, comment, on, the, kind, of, jading, culture, perpetuated, by, martial, arts, media,, or, just, a, movie, made, by, a, seriously, crazy, person., My, bet’s, on, the, latter,, and, only, that,, because, there, is, palpable,, irrepressible, glee, in, the, punching, open, of, an, obese, man’s, stomach,, or, the, vice-like, obliterating, of, another, man’s, skull,, or, how,, when, another, fighter, blocks, Ricky’s, jab,, that, poor, guy’s, fist, splinters, into, a, fine, red, mist, spritzed, between, shards, of, ulna., It, is, all—all, of, it—just, totally, fucking, insane:, watch, with, your, friends,, laugh, with, your, friends,, cheer, with, your, friends, when,, at, the, very, end,, Ricky—spoiler, alert—through, the, sheer, power, of, his, inhuman, awesomeness,, punches, down, a, 30-foot, concrete, wall., Because, that, happens., —D.S., 36., The, Duel, Year:, 1971, Director:, Chang, Cheh, In, the, U.S.,, this, early, Chang, Cheh, feature, was, known, as, Duel, of, the, Iron, Fist,, and, although, badass-sounding,, it’s, blatantly, inaccurate,, as, the, amount, of, traditional, kung, fu, in, this, film, is, on, the, light, side., Rather,, The, Duel, is, something, more, unique,, a, moody, and, well-acted, crime, drama, that, still, has, tons, of, bloody, martial, arts, action, sequences,, many, of, them, being, knife, fights., The, film, features, perhaps, the, two, biggest, stars, of, the, day,, Ti, Lung, and, David, Chiang,, as, the, participants, in, the, titular, duel,, and, this, was, a, pretty, big, deal., Both, had, typically, played, heroes, in, the, past,, and, both, had, been, paired, together, as, allies., For, the, Chinese, audience,, seeing, the, two, of, them, finally, come, to, blows, in, a, duel, to, the, death, was, a, bit, like, watching, Macho, Man, Randy, Savage, turn, against, Hulk, Hogan, and, break, up, the, Mega, Powers., David, Chiang, alone, kills, nearly, 100, people, in, this, freaking, movie., —J.V., 35., Come, Drink, With, Me, Year:, 1966, Director:, King, Hu, (with, Sammo, Hung), With, a, female, protagonist, (Cheng, Pei-pei), at, the, head, of, an, army, of, warrior, women, and, the, Shaw, Brothers’, stamp, early, on, in, the, production, company’s, run,, Come, Drink, With, Me, not, only, broke, the, wuxia, mold,, it, practically, created, it., Without, the, film,, there, would, have, been, no, Kill, Bill, (Quentin, Tarantino, has, even, been, rumored, for, years, to, have, a, remake, in, his, docket);, in, fact,, without, this, film’s, meager, success, in, the, U.S.,, later, bolstered, by, the, Weinstein, Brothers, commitment, to, bringing, martial, arts, classics, to, cult-inclined, Western, audiences,, there, are, few, other, films, of, its, ilk, that, would, have, ever, been, embraced, outside, of, China, and, Hong, Kong., Achingly, tender, in, moments,, with, fight, scenes, that, more, resemble, sophisticated,, choreographed, dance, than, realistic, brawls,, the, influence, of, Come, Drink, With, Me, can’t, be, overstated., Even, if, you’ve, never, seen, it,, when, you, think, of, martial, arts, film,, you, think, of, something, akin, to, this., —D.S., 34., Swordsman, 2, Year:, 1992, Director:, Ching, Siu-tung, Colorful,, complex, and, engaging,, Swordsman, 2, is, a, great, star, vehicle, for, a, young, Jet, Li, and, perhaps, the, best, Chinese, wuxia, movie, of, the, ’90s, in, the, classical, sense., It’s, a, sweeping, historical, drama, with, a, rather, confusing, plot,, but, suffice, to, say, there, are, multiple, clans, vying, for, possession, of, a, scroll—total, macguffin, stuff,, really., It’s, a, great, excuse, to, get, a, bunch, of, martial, artists, together, and, let, them, have, at, it, in, really, dramatic,, superpowered,, ham-handed, ways:, I, love, when, the, ninjas, show, up, and, attack, the, camp, at, night, by, hurling, both, throwing, stars, and, SACKS, FULL, OF, SCORPIONS, at, their, opponents., There’s, tons, of, flashy, swordplay, as, you, would, expect, in, a, great, wuxia, film,, and, lots, of, wire-aided, fight, scene, craziness., Martial, arts, fans, tend, to, praise, films, almost, exclusively, for, realism, and, real, acrobatics,, but, Swordsman, 2, is, a, great, example, of, the, mystical, artistry, that, good, wire-work, does, bring, to, the, film, when, used, to, set, a, visual, aesthetic, properly., —J.V., 33., Ong-Bak:, The, Thai, Warrior, Year:, 2003, Director:, Prachya, Pinkaew, After, a, decade-long, trend, toward, ever, more, prominent, wire, work, and, special, effects,, Tony, Jaa’s, 2003, Thai, star, vehicle, Ong-Bak, was, a, return, to, insane, stunts, (all, performed, by, Jaa, himself), and, hard-hitting, action., Featuring, an, utter, lack, of, both, wire-fu, and, CGI,, Ong-Bak, is, a, jaw-dropping, viewing, experience., Although, the, story, is, little, more, than, an, excuse, to, trek, across, Thailand, (both, Bangkok, and, the, countryside), in, a, constant, stream, of, crazy, chase, sequences, and, even, crazier, fights,, the, film, is, so, unashamed, of, being, exactly, what, it, is, and, nothing, more, that, one, can’t, help, but, smile, and, fully, resign, to, being, blown, away, by, some, of, the, most, impressive, displays, of, martial, arts—and, physicality, in, general—to, hit, the, screen, in, the, new, millennium., —K., Alexander, Smith, 32., The, Raid:, Redemption, Year:, 2011, Director:, Gareth, Evans, When, future, generations, look, back, upon, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, and, seek, a, way, to, understand, the, claustrophobia, and, fear, that, defined, so, much, of, our, popular, media, of, the, time,, let, them, look, upon, The, Raid, and, weep., Essentially, one, extended, action, set-piece,, paced, with, super-human, precision, to, both, incite, and, then, maximally, exploit, one’s, heightened, dopamine, levels,, The, Raid, leaves, no, headspace, for, hesitation—once, you’re, in,, you’re, at, its, mercy,, and, the, film’s, only, relief, awaits, at, the, top, of, an, apartment, block, ruled, by, one, of, Jakarta’s, scrappiest,, psychopathic-iest, crime, bosses., The, Raid, is, what, martial, arts, cinema, looks, like, in, our, young, century:, bleak,, dystopian, and, hyper-violent., This, is, brutality, at, its, barest., —D.S., 31., Fist, of, Fury,, aka, The, Chinese, Connection, Year:, 1972, Director:, Lo, Wei, Bruce, Lee’s, second, feature, is, a, definite, upgrade, over, the, rawness, of, The, Big, Boss,, sporting, a, bigger, budget,, better, production, and, a, story, more, important, to, Lee’s, values., His, character,, Chen, Zhen,, becomes, a, Chinese, folk, hero, when, he, stands, up, to, the, invading, Japanese, occupiers—especially, in, the, classic, scene, where, he, breaks, a, sign, permitting, “no, Chinese, and, no, dogs”, in, the, local, park., This, is, the, film, where, Bruce, Lee, truly, arrived, in, a, fully, formed, state,, and, if, there’s, a, precise, moment, when, that, happens,, it’s, the, classic, dojo, fight, where, Chen, shows, up, at, the, Japanese, training, facility, and, absolutely, goes, to, town, on, everyone, inside., It’s, iconic,, like, so, many, Bruce, Lee, moments., Do, you, know, how, you, can, tell, just, how, iconic, he, is?, Literally, every, piece, of, clothing, he, wore, in, a, film, has, become, a, visual, symbol, for, decades, to, come,, whether, it’s, a, simple, white, shirt,, or, this, film’s, navy, blue, suit,, or, of, course, the, yellow, tracksuit, from, The, Game, of, Death., That’s, how, you, know, the, guy, is, a, legend., —J.V., 30., Mad, Monkey, Kung, Fu, Year:, 1979, Director:, Lau, Kar-leung, Another, Lau, Kar-leung, classic, for, the, Shaw, Brothers,, Mad, Monkey, Kung, Fu, is, just, an, inherently, likable, film, that, deftly, balances, feats, of, athleticism, with, broad, humor., Hsiao, Ho,, a, martial, artist, who, does, not, get, the, recognition, that, he, deserves,, stars, as, a, young, street, urchin, and, thief, who, is, taken, in, by, a, street, entertainer, who, performs, alongside, a, trained, monkey., He, learns, kung, fu, from, his, new, teacher,, and, combines, it, with, the, monkey’s, movements, in, some, great, training, sequences., Eventually,, he, must, use, his, new, style, of, monkey, kung, fu, to, seek, out, a, local, brothel, owner, who, is, holding, a, young, woman, hostage., Hsiao, Ho, is, wonderfully, expressive, in, the, role,, and, his, acrobatics, in, particular, are, top-notch., He, plays, the, part, of, the, long-suffering,, then, overconfident,, then, humbled, student, perfectly., —J.V., 29., The, Street, Fighter, Year:, 1974, Director:, Shigehiro, Ozawa, Trivia, blurb:, The, Street, Fighter, was, the, first, film, to, ever, receive, an, X-rating, in, the, U.S., strictly, for, violence—a, full, 16, minutes, had, to, be, cut, out, to, get, an, R-rating., Damn!, This, is, the, film, that, made, a, star, of, Sonny, Chiba,, who, you, will, again, recognize, as, the, wizened, sword-maker, Hattori, Hanzo, in, Kill, Bill., He, plays, a, truly, unique, protagonist, in, this, film,, an, anti-hero, who, is, far, more, “anti”, than, hero,, most, of, the, time., A, hired, killer,, his, character,, Terry, Tsurugi,, has, pretty, much, nothing, that, one, would, call, a, “moral, code,”, but, the, audience, is, moved, into, his, favor, when, the, villains, who, are, trying, to, employ, him, instead, decide, to, have, him, rubbed, out., Truth, be, told,, Chiba, isn’t, the, most, compelling, actor, in, the, world, here,, but, man, does, he, just, have, the, look., The, rage, and, intensity, in, his, face, goes, a, long, way,, and, they, got, mileage, out, of, it, for, multiple, sequels., You, can’t, deny, that, the, film, is, a, classic., —J.V., 28., Magnificent, Butcher, Year:, 1979, Director:, Yuen, Woo-ping, Magnificent, Butcher, has, the, slapstick, and, bawdy, humor, that, one, usually, expects, from, a, Sammo, Hung, star, vehicle,, but, it, also, knows, how, to, be, deadly, serious, at, the, same, time,, which, makes, it, rather, unique., Hung, stars, as, a, literal, butcher, who, has, learned, the, ways, of, kung, fu, from, folk, hero, Wong, Fei-hung,, played, here, by, the, truly, magnificent, Kwan, Tak-hing,, who, was, 74, at, the, time, but, puts, on, an, incredible, physical, performance., The, calligraphy, scene, in, particular, is, legendary—a, rival, master, comes, in, to, challenge, Wong, Fei-hung,, who, defends, himself, with, skill, and, humor, while, simultaneously, completing, a, piece, of, calligraphy, It’s, in, an, awe-inspiring, display., Butcher, Wing,, meanwhile,, reunites, with, his, long-lost, brother, and, must, help, him, rescue, his, kidnapped, wife., The, film, may, feature, Sammo, Hung’s, best, overall, one-on-one, fight, scene, against, Lee, Hoi, San,, really, showcasing, the, portly, performer’s, acrobatics., Sammo, Hung, really, was, one-of-a-kind., —J.V., 27., Warriors, Two, Year:, 1978, Director:, Sammo, Hung, Wing, chun, is, a, very, influential, style, of, martial, arts, when, it, comes, to, film,, but, it, might, be, surprising, for, martial, arts, fans, to, know, that, true,, traditional, wing, chun, is, actually, quite, rare, on, screen., Warriors, Two,, a, modest,, straightforward, story, of, a, young, man, training, in, martial, arts, to, protect, a, town,, is, one, of, those, few, films, well-regarded, as, featuring, quite, a, lot, of, authentic, wing, chun,, in, the, style, which, master, Ip, Man, would, have, taught, to, a, young, Bruce, Lee., It’s, a, small-scale, film, featuring, director, Sammo, Hung, in, a, supporting, role,, but, the, stars, of, the, show, are, Casanova, Wong, as, the, hero, and, especially, his, master,, Bryan, Leung., Leung,, who, has, appeared, in, numerous, kung, fu, roles, and, continues, to, perform, to, this, day,, is, affectionately, known, to, fans, as, “Beardy,”, but, this, happens, to, be, one, of, the, rare, roles, where, he’s, quite, beardless., —J.V., 26., Rumble, in, the, Bronx, Year:, 1995, Director:, Stanley, Tong, Here’s, a, weird, factoid:, Jackie, Chan, was, 41, years, old, in, 1995,, when, Rumble, in, the, Bronx, succeeded, in, making, him, an, American, film, star., He’d, already, been, a, star, in, China, for, more, than, a, decade,, but, can, you, think, of, any, other, martial, artists, who, turn, into, a, big, deal, for, the, first, time, after, their, 40th, birthdays?, The, irrepressibly, youthful, Chan, plays, a, Hong, Kong, cop, who, comes, to, New, York, for, a, wedding, and, gets, sucked, into, a, criminal, underworld., It, wasn’t, Chan’s, first, American, film,, but, it, was, the, one, that, finally, synthesized, the, trademark, Chan, dynamic:, Fast, pace,, lots, of, physical, comedy, and, death-defying, stunt, work., Don’t, look, for, compelling, acting, here,, because, Rumble, in, the, Bronx, is, as, cheesy, as, they, come., Do, look, for, classic, stunts,, like, Chan, leaping, off, a, building, and, onto, a, fire, escape, with, no, wires, or, nets., Or, the, epic, fight, in, the, villain’s, headquarters, and, its, hilarious, use, of, props,, especially, refrigerators., —J.V., 25., Wheels, on, Meals, Year:, 1984, Director:, Sammo, Hung, Wheels, on, Meals, is, a, silly,, silly, movie,, but, damn,, is, the, action, amazing., As, far, as, trios, go,, it’s, harder, to, get, better, than, Jackie, Chan,, Yuen, Biao, and, Sammo, Hung,, although, Hung’s, role, in, this, one, is, minimal., Rather,, it, all, comes, down, to, some, incredible, fight, scenes, featuring, Chan, and, Benny, “The, Jet”, Urquidez,, a, real-life, American, kickboxing, champion, who, makes, the, perfect, dance, partner, for, Chan, in, several, high-octane, brawls., Their, final, confrontation, isn’t, just, a, great, scene,, it, might, be, the, best, one-on-one, fight, scene, of, Chan’s, career,, and, Benny, The, Jet, is, just, as, good, as, Chan., In, fact,, it’s, The, Jet, who, pulls, off, one, of, the, coolest, fight, scene, feats, I’ve, ever, seen,, the, supposedly, unintentional, (and, unfaked), “candle, kick,”, where, a, missed, spin, kick, generates, such, force, that, it, blows, out, all, of, the, lit, candles, on, a, candelabra, several, feet, away., You, really, have, to, see, it, to, believe, it., Oh,, and, there’s, also, a, story, about, a, kidnapped, girl,, but, the, kicks, are, far, more, interesting., —J.V., 24., The, Grandmaster, Year:, 2013, Director:, Kar, Wai, Wong, Kar, Wai, Wong, will, indefatigably, make, anything, elegant,, and, so, it’s, a, given, that, The, Grandmaster, is, a, gorgeously, paced, historical, epic, told, in, patient, piecemeal., A, loose, chronicle, of, the, nascent, legend, of, Yip, Man,, the, film, skirts, the, line, between, noir-ish, tragedy, and, chiaroscuro, thriller,, rarely, leaving, room, to, discern, the, difference., From, an, opening, set-piece, that, will, leave, you, wondering, why, any, other, director, since, would, ever, bother, capturing, rain, droplets, in, slo-motion,, to, one, masterfully, orchestrated, balsa-wood-tower, of, martial, arts, prowess, after, another,, there, is, little, left, to, say, about, Wong’s, directing, other, than, the, cliché:, this, is, balletic, action, filmmaking—heartfelt, and, beautiful, but, never, so, far, removed, from, the, brutality, of, the, action, at, hand, that, it, romanticizes, the, pummeling, of, so, many, hapless, foes., There, are, penalties, to, these, punches, and, consequences, to, these, kicks—there, should, be, little, doubt, that, The, Grandmaster, is, not, just, a, masterpiece, of, its, genre, but, one, of, Kar, Wai, Wong’s, best., That, Netflix is, only, streaming, the, dumbed-down, American, version, shouldn’t, keep, you, from, enjoying, what, brilliance, is, on, display,, but, by, all, means,, seek, out, the, Chinese, original., —D.S., 23., Martial, Club, Year:, 1981, Director:, Lau, Kar-leung, Martial, Club, opens, with, a, pretty, damn, weird, sequence, of, Lau, Kar-leung, instructing, the, audience, on, the, finer, points, of, “lion, dancing.”, It’s, odd,, but, soldier, on, through, it, and, you’ll, find, two, of, the, more, fun,, creative, fights, in, the, annals, of, classic, kung, fu, in, this, modest,, low-budget, throwback, story., The, first, is, an, all-out, brawl, in, a, theater, that, sends, bodies, flying, in, all, directions, as, members, of, multiple, schools, clash., The, second, is, the, really, iconic, one,, as, Gordon, Liu, takes, on, Wang, Lung, Wei, in, a, truly, unique, location—the, ultra-cramped, alleyway, between, two, buildings., As, the, fight, progresses, and, they, drive, deeper, into, the, alley,, space, becomes, tighter, and, tighter, until, the, two, have, only, a, foot, or, two, in, which, to, conduct, combat., It, completely, changes, the, aesthetic, of, a, traditional, kung, fu, battle,, and, the, choreography, evolves, with, it., It’s, simply, one, of, the, most, memorable, one-on-one, fight, scenes, in, classic, Hong, Kong, cinema., —J.V., 22., Heroes, of, the, East,, aka, Shaolin, Challenges, Ninja, Year:, 1978, Director:, Lau, Kar-Leung, Gordon, Liu, is, our, hero, in, the, classic, Heroes, of, the, East,, but, it’s, not, quite, the, Gordon, Liu, we’re, used, to., Quite, honestly,, the, Gordon, in, this, movie, is, a, dick—he, marries, a, Japanese, woman, and, tries, to, convert, her, to, more, “ladylike”, martial, arts, before, offending, all, the, prominent, martial, artists, in, her, country, and, ending, up, in, a, series, of, duels, with, them., The, film, is, unconventional, in, portraying, the, Japanese, not, as, outright, villains, but, simply, aggrieved,, honorable, fighters., What, we, get, from, that, set-up, is, a, fascinating, contrast, in, styles,, and, fights, that, pit, balanced, elements, of, combat, against, one, another—for, example,, Chinese, drunken, boxing, vs., Sino-Okinawan, karate., Or, Japanese, weapons, such, as, the, sai, against, Chinese, butterfly, swords., It’s, simply, fun,, classic, stuff,, and, a, story, that, doesn’t, feel, like, it’s, been, told, a, million, times, before., Personal, favorite:, Gordon, takes, on, a, ninja-looking, dude, wielding, “the, Japanese, crab, technique.”, It, involves, a, lot, of, scuttling, side-to-side, and, tiny, little, shuffle-steps,, and, it, will, probably, make, you, chuckle., —J.V., 21., One-Armed, Swordsman, Year:, 1967, Director:, Chang, Cheh, If, this, list, was, ranked, purely, in, terms, of, which, films, were, most, influential, to, their, genres,, One-Armed, Swordsman, would, be, up, near, the, tip-top,, along, with, The, Chinese, Boxer,, which, also, starred, Swordsman’s, Jimmy, Wang., As, for, wuxia,, though,, this, is, like, the, ur-film,, the, one, that, defined, so, many, of, the, stylistic, conventions, for, decades, to, come,, such, as, the, dangerous,, brooding, anti-hero, and, the, swordplay/limb-hacking, action, sequences., So,, so, many, films, were, made, in, the, following, years, about, one-armed, fighters,, and, Chang, Cheh’s, classic, was, behind, it, all., That, can, make, it, seem, a, little, cliché-laden, today,, but, it’s, still, a, charming, film, to, watch,, and, a, classic, story, never, truly, goes, out, of, style., I, especially, like, the, villains’, “sword, lock”, devices, that, can, catch, a, sword, blade, and, lock, it, in, position., —J.V., 20., Kid, With, the, Golden, Arm, Year:, 1979, Director:, Chang, Cheh, Another, Venom, Mob, film, from, Chang, Cheh,, and, one, of, the, best., It, mixes, up, the, usual, casting, somewhat, by, putting, the, beefy, Lo, Mang, as, the, titular, “Kid, With, the, Golden, Arm,”, who, is, the, primary, antagonist, and, not, the, hero, as, one, might, expect., It, was, a, shift, for, Lo, Mang,, who, usually, played, characters, who, were, sort, of, powerful,, likable, galoots,, but, he, shines, by, giving, what, is, likely, his, best, performance, in, a, story, about, a, gang, of, outlaws, who, plot, to, intercept, a, large, shipment, of, gold., The, heroes, are, a, team, of, familiar, Chang, Cheh, faces, assembled, to, stop, Golden, Arm, and, his, gang:, ever-present, hero, Kuo, Chui, is, a, drunken, master,, while, there’s, also, some, fighters, specializing, in, sword, and, axe, combat., Honestly,, Kid, With, the, Golden, Arm, isn’t, particularly, complex, or, even, all, that, original,, but, it’s, pure,, unadulterated, old-school, kung, fu, fun., —J.V., 19., A, Touch, of, Zen, Year:, 1971, Director:, King, Hu, If, King, Hu’s, Dragon, Gate, Inn, established, a, lot, of, the, hallmarks, of, classic, wuxia,, then, A, Touch, of, Zen, elevated, things, to, the, next, level., A, film, of, style,, grace, and, gravitas,, A, Touch, of, Zen, is, unusual, in, that, it, features, a, veritable, non-combatant, as, its, lead, protagonist,, although, he, is, surrounded, by, many, others, who, know, how, to, fight., Beyond, its, choreography, and, effects, (which, won, it, the, first-ever, award, at, Cannes for, a, Chinese-language, film),, this, three-hour, epic, (it’s, very, long), is, also, noted, for, its, strong, themes, of, spirituality, and, the, tenants, of, Buddhism,, which, have, rarely, been, explored, in, detail, even, in, the, years, since., Truly, influential, in, many, ways,, it, is, perhaps, best, encapsulated, in, the, famous, bamboo, forest, swordfight,, which, gave, birth, to, so, many, similar, fights, over, the, years,, to, the, point, where, “bamboo, forest, fight”, is, one, of, the, most, common, of, all, wuxia, tropes., Films, like, Crouching, Tiger,, Hidden, Dragon, and, House, of, Flying, Daggers, owe, much, to, this, one., —J.V., 18., Police, Story, Year:, 1985, Director:, Jackie, Chan, Remember, that, scene, in, The, Blues, Brothers, where, Jake, and, Elwood, drive, the, Bluesmobile, through, a, mall, and, wreck, it, up, good?, That’s, basically, what, Jackie, Chan, does, to, a, shopping, center, in, Police, Story,, except, it’s, with, his, own, two, hands., Seriously,, there’s, enough, breakaway, glass, in, that, one,, nine-minute, fight, scene, for, 10, martial, arts, movies., Chan, plays, a, cop, (again), who, goes, after, bad, guys, (again)., Why, complicate, the, plot, synopsis, any, more, than, that?, The, only, sensible, way, to, rank, Jackie, Chan, movies, is, simply, to, focus, on, the, action, and, the, death-defying, stunts,, which, all, the, films, in, the, Police, Story, series, have, in, spades., Chan, has, called, the, first, Police, Story, his, greatest, film,, though,, and, who, are, we, to, argue?, —J.V., 17., Tai, Chi, Master, Year:, 1993, Director:, Yuen, Woo-ping, Leave, it, to, Jet, Li, to, invent, Tai, Chi., Another, potboiler, plot, filmed, with, epic, scale, and, impeccable, grace,, Yuen, Woo-ping’s, Tai, Chi, Master, pits, the, mild-mannered, Junbao, (Li), against, childhood, friend, and, wildcard, Tienbo, (Chin, Siu, Ho), in, a, rapidly, escalating, yarn, about, what, happens, when, great, power, is, grabbed, without, responsibility., See, also:, Michelle, Yeoh, transubstantiating, table, legs, into, stilts,, upon, which, she, balances, while, attempting, to, brain, an, opponent, with, a, lute;, an, extended, high-wire, act, dappling, the, side, of, an, executioner’s, tower,, alternately, kept, up, and, torn, apart, mid-brawl, by, Junbao, and, a, furious, Tienbo,, respectively;, and, a, final, battle, atop, precariously, bouncy, netting,, Tienbo, literally, getting, his, come-uppance., Also?, Junbao, handles, a, ball, of, wind-bonded, leaves, as, a, raver, would, a, pair, of, glowsticks., Every, set-piece, Yuen, sets, his, eye, to, is, a, dead-serious, lark,, halfway, between, hilarity, and, awe,, so, that, by, the, time, Junbao’s, kung, fu, is, an, equal, match, to, Tienbo’s,, their, showdown, is, settling, nothing, less, than, an, ultimate, power, struggle, between, good, and, evil., —D.S., 16., Shogun, Assassin, Year:, 1980, (or, 1972), Director:, Robert, Houston, Shogun, Assassin, is, bizarre, to, explain,, hilarious, to, watch, and, incredibly, entertaining, from, start, to, finish,, a, garish, but, gorgeous, piece, of, exploitation, cinema, that, transcends, its, grimy, aesthetic, and, becomes, something, absolutely, beautiful., Shogun, Assassin, is, the, American, name, for, the, film,, which, is, assembled, from, footage, clipped, together, from, two, 1972, Japanese, samurai, films, adapted, from, a, popular, manga, called, Lone, Wolf, and, Cub., The, American, release,, however,, completely, transforms, the, experience, by, cutting, down, the, story, to, its, barest, necessities,, adding, voiceover, narration, from, the, point, of, view, of, a, toddler,, and, preserving, all, the, fight, scenes, in, their, hyper-violent, glory., It, sounds, terrible,, but, in, terms, of, pure, entertainment, and, humor, (some, purposeful,, some, inadvertent),, it’s, almost, impossible, to, beat., The, tale, of, a, father, on, the, run, with, his, young,, vulnerable, son, just, gets, more, and, more, ridiculous, from, start, to, finish,, and, the, body, count, is, too, high, to, count., The, film, was, such, a, huge, influence, on, the, style, of, Quentin, Tarantino, that, you, can, actually, hear, some, of, it, in, Kill, Bill, Vol., 2—it’s, the, bedtime, movie, that, Uma, Thurman, watches, with, her, daughter,, which, is, even, funnier, when, you’ve, seen, it, and, realize, just, how, inappropriate, Shogun, Assassin, is, for, children, …, the, father, and, son, are, referred, to, in, the, trailer, as, “the, greatest, team, in, the, history, of, mass, slaughter.”, —J.V., 15., Fist, of, Legend, Year:, 1994, Director:, Gordon, Chan, Jet, Li, is, one, of, the, few, kung, fu, practitioners, who, can, make, the, claim, that, he’s, played, his, own, teacher, and, student—his, character, Chen, Zhen, is, the, student, of, Huo, Yuanjia,, who, he, then, played, 12, years, later, in, Fearless., Fist, of, Legend,, on, the, other, hand,, is, essentially, a, remake, of, Bruce, Lee’s, Fist, of, Fury,, another, tale, pitting, Chinese, nationalist, against, the, oppression, of, Japanese, invaders, in, the, Second, Sino-Japanese, War., There’s, nothing, too, fancy, about, the, story:, “You, killed, my, master,, and, I’m, going, to, get, to, the, bottom, of, it.”, What’s, fancy, is, the, fighting,, because, oh, man,, can, Jet, Li, kick, some, serious, ass, in, this, one., Through, most, of, the, film,, he’s, seriously, on, another, level,, until, he, meets, the, seemingly, superpowered, Japanese, guy, who, is, the, final, villain., I, actually, prefer, one, of, the, earlier, fights,, though,, when, Jet, takes, on, an, entire, school, of, Japanese, karate, students—and, then, punches, their, master, right, on, the, bottom, of, the, foot, in, a, particularly, goofy, bit, of, violence., —J.V., 14., The, 8, Diagram, Pole, Fighter, Year:, 1983, Director:, Lau, Kar-leung, If, there, is, one, Shaw, Brothers, kung, fu, film, with, which, to, ever, start,, let, The, 8, Diagram, Pole, Fighter, be, it., An, epitome, of, brisk,, unadorned, Hong, Kong, martial, arts, pulp,, the, film, stars, a, steely-eyed, Gordon, Liu, as, a, lauded, general, who, must, abandon, his, rage, to, become, a, monk—at, least, until, it, comes, time, to, avenge, his, family’s, murder, at, the, hands, of, another, traitorous, general., No, trope, goes, untouched,, from, one, warrior’s, lapse, into, insanity,, to, the, whole, film’s, lapse, into, ever-mounting, madness—a, bloody, spree, of, what-ifs, carry, 8, Diagram, Pole, Fighter, to, its, vague, and, body-littered, conclusion., Because, revenge, will, never, bring, your, murdered, loved, ones, back, to, life,, right?, Still,, there’s, no, harm, in, trying,, and, if, that, means, you, need, to, turn, a, bale, of, bamboo, poles, into, a, makeshift, bamboo-pole-shooting, cannon,, then, so, be, it., And, if, that, also, means, that, you, need, to, graphically, rip, out, your, enemies’, teeth, by, making, them, chomp, down, on, those, same, bamboo, poles, and, then, forcefully, rip, the, whole, package, from, unwilling, jaws,, then, so, be, that,, too., And, god, forbid, you’ll, be, required, to, cleave, off, a, nipple, of, two., This, is, just, what, happens, when, you, mess, with, a, monk, dead-set, on, breaking, his, vows., —D.S., 13., Master, of, the, Flying, Guillotine, Year:, 1976, Director:, Jimmy, Wang, Master, of, the, Flying, Guillotine, is, a, hallucinogenic, delight,, the, kind, of, inspired, lunacy, that, people, who, have, never, seen, kung, fu, probably, picture, in, their, heads, when, it’s, brought, up…except, crazier., A, Jimmy, Wang, vehicle, (the, same, guy, from, One, Armed, Swordsman),, it’s, more, notable, for, its, awesome, villain,, the, titular, user, of, the, flying, guillotine., What’s, the, flying, guillotine,, you, ask?, Only, the, coolest, weapon, in, martial, arts, cinema, history., It’s, essentially, an, oversized, hat,, attached, to, a, chain,, that, is, thrown, over, a, victim’s, head., When, the, chain, is, yanked,, the, hat, spins, and, the, inner, blades, neatly, cut, off, the, victim’s, head, like, a, circular, saw., Jimmy, Wang’s, duels, with, both, the, master, and, his, lackeys, are, presented, seriously,, but, they’re, equally, funny, because, the, villains, are, so, out, there., Particularly, great:, The, “yoga, master”, who, can, extend, his, arms, like, Dhalsim, in, Street, Fighter, 2,, because, that’s, how, yoga, works,, right?, —J.V., 12., Ip, Man, Year:, 2008, Director:, Wilson, Yip, 2008’s, Ip, Man, was, finally, the, moment, when, the, truly, excellent, but, never, fairly, regarded, Donnie, Yen, came, into, his, own,, playing, a, loosely, biographical, version, of, the, legendary, grandmaster, of, Wing, Chun, and, teacher, of, a, number, of, future, martial, arts, masters,, one, of, whom, was, Bruce, Lee., The, film, takes, place, in, 1930s, Foshan, (a, city, famous, for, martial, arts, in, southern/central, China),, where, the, unassuming, master, tries, to, weather, the, 1937, Japanese, invasion, and, occupation, of, China, peacefully,, but, is, eventually, forced, into, action—limb-shattering,, face-pulverizing, action., This, semi-historical, film, succeeds, gloriously:, both, as, cinematic, triumph, and, as, martial, arts, fan-bait., —K.A.S, 11., Kill, Bill, Vol.1, and, Vol., 2, Year:, 2003,, 2004, Director:, Quentin, Tarantino, The, greatness, of, Kill, Bill, Vol., 1, was, in, its, finely, tuned, balance, between, acting, as, an, homage, to, classic, martial, arts, movies, (both, Chinese, and, Japanese), and, as, a, blistering, entry, into, the, genre, canon, on, its, own, visceral,, offbeat, merits., In, the, early, 2000s,, there, was, perhaps, no, cinematic, experience, like, it, (well,, at, least, until, Vol., 2, arrived)., The, gory, but, graceful, tea, house, battle, with, the, Crazy, 88;, the, intensely, claustrophobic, kitchen, showdown—these, are, only, two, excellent, examples, of, everything, that, makes, a, martial, arts, movie, superb., That, Tarantino, filled, two, movies, with, this, stuff, of, greatness, makes, for, some, truly, transcendent, viewing., —K.A.S., 10., Iron, Monkey, Year:, 1993, Director:, Yuen, Woo-ping, One, might, reasonably, call, Iron, Monkey, the, quintessential, Hong, Kong, martial, arts, film, of, the, ’90s,, well, known, in, the, U.S., as, well, thanks, to, the, enterprising, efforts, of, a, young, Quentin, Tarantino,, who, convinced, Miramax, to, give, it, a, successful, U.S., release., However,, one, should, really, see, the, original, Chinese, version, in, its, unedited, state, for, the, performances, by, Yu, Rongguang, as, the, vigilante, Iron, Monkey, and, Donnie, Yen, at, his, best, as, the, father, of, a, boy, who, would, go, on, to, become, one, of, China’s, greatest, folk, heroes, (and, subject, of, many, films, as, well)., Purely, entertaining,, Iron, Monkey, never, takes, itself, overly, seriously,, striking, an, easygoing, balance, between, hyper-kinetic,, somewhat, unrealistic, action, and, a, broadly, appealing,, Robin, Hood-like, story., It’s, the, definition, of, a, kung, fu, people-pleaser., —J.V., 9., Tom-Yum-Goong,, aka, The, Protector, Year:, 2005, Director:, Prachya, Pinkaew, If, what, you, want, out, of, a, martial, arts, movie, is, to, just, watch, an, invincible, engine, of, destruction, wreck, his, way, through, everything, in, his, path,, then, Tom-Yum, Goong, is, your, movie., Tony, Jaa, is, nothing, short, of, incredible, as, a, physical, specimen, and, performer,, in, a, movie, where, the, primary, plot, point, is, driven, by…stolen, elephants?, What?, Oh,, no, matter—who, cares, when, Jaa’s, insane, blend, of, muy, thai, and, capoeira, is, carving, up, legions, of, goons?, The, action, is, realistic,, impactful, and, on, a, whole, other, level, in, terms, of, brutality., Exhibit, A:, The, scene, where, Jaa, takes, it, upon, himself, to, break, the, arms, and, legs, of, everyone, he, comes, into, contact, with., Exhibit, B:, Perhaps, the, greatest, single-shot, fight, scene, in, movie, history,, as, Jaa, ascends, from, the, bottom, of, a, tower, to, the, top,, fighting, dozens, of, mooks, in, a, single,, unbroken, shot, that, lasts, four, minutes., Absolutely, gorgeous,, and, insanely, ambitious, to, even, attempt., The, format, of, the, scene, actually, brings, the, audience, out, of, the, film, slightly,, making, us, aware, of, the, cameraman, following, Jaa,, which, only, gives, us, a, greater, appreciation, for, the, stunt, work, and, movie, magic, involved., —J.V., 8., Five, Element, Ninjas,, aka, Chinese, Super, Ninjas, Year:, 1982, Director:, Chang, Cheh, This, was, Cheh’s, swan, song, with, the, Shaw, Brothers,, as, tastes, were, changing, and, leaving, the, costumed, period, pieces, behind—but, man,, it’s, a, doozy., Responding, to, the, out-there, stylistic, choices, of, the, town,, the, director, apparently, said, “I’ll, just, outdo, everyone,”, and, he, produced, one, of, the, most, ludicrous, (but, awesome), kung, fu, films, ever, made., This, is, the, essence, of, Saturday, morning, kung, fu, theater, in, America,, but, if, you, only, saw, it, that, way,, it’s, doing, the, film, a, disservice,, because, you’re, likely, to, miss, out, on, the, surprising, and, sometimes, comical, gore, of, the, fight, scenes., The, story, revolves, around, a, few, young, fighters, seeking, vengeance, against, a, ninja, clan, that, massacred, their, classmates,, but, it’s, the, villains, that, really, stand, out., Each, group, of, ninjas, has, their, own, absurd, costumes, and, ridiculous, quirks., Gold, ninjas, use, their, shields, to, blind, enemies., Water, ninjas, use, snorkels, and, pull, opponents, down, underwater, to, drown, them., Fire, ninjas, use, smoke, shields, to, hide, and, move., Wood, ninjas, pose, as, trees, and, use, claws, to, slash, and, tear., And, finally,, the, supremely, goofy, Earth, ninjas, are, somehow, able, to, tunnel, through, solid, soil, like, freaking, earthworms, and, explode, out, of, the, ground, with, an, almighty, bang., Five, Element, Ninjas, is, as, crazy, as, kung, fu, gets,, but, you’ve, got, to, love, it, for, its, entertaining, excesses., —J.V., 7., Drunken, Master, 2,, aka, The, Legend, of, Drunken, Master, Year:, 1994, Director:, Chia-Liang, Liu, 1994’s, Drunken, Master, II, (released, in, the, U.S., as, The, Legend, of, Drunken, Master), is, Jackie, Chan’s, best, movie—by, far., It, features, everything, uniquely, awesome, about, Chan’s, martial-arts, movie, stardom, while, showcasing, each, of, his, prime, elements, (fluidity, of, motion/technique,, comedic, timing,, sheer, athleticism), better, than, in, any, one, of, his, other, cinematic, punch-outs,, including, the, original, 1978, Drunken, Master, (starring, an, obviously, much, younger, Chan)., Here, he, leads, as, Wong, Fei, Hung,, a, Chinese, folk, hero, who, employs, his, Zui, Quan, (Drunken, Boxing), skills, to, stop, the, corrupt, British, consul, set, on, illegally, exporting, Chinese, artifacts, out, of, the, country., Although, nearly, all, the, action, sequences, are, wonderfully, exhaustive, and, memorable,, the, final, fight, is, a, breathless, show-stopper., —K.A.S., 6., Crouching, Tiger,, Hidden, Dragon, Year:, 2000, Director: Ang, Lee , Ang, Lee’s, Oscar-winning, epic, is, not, only, the, highest-grossing, foreign, film, ever,, but, it, also, happens, to, be, yet, another, foreign, film, that, changed, the, cinematic, landscape:, a, kung, fu, flick, with, pulpy, soul, and, a, romantic, heart., Chow, Yun-Fat,, Michelle, Yeoh, and, Zhang, Ziyi, play, 19th-century, warriors, whose, loyalty, and, vitality, are, tested, by, a, series, of, events, that, lead, each, to, contemplate, their, many, life, decisions, that, brought, them, to, that, point., Beyond, the, entrancing, and, lyrical, storytelling,, Crouching, Tiger, stands, as, a, rare,, beautiful, beacon, of, hope:, a, foreign, film, that, was, actually, universally, embraced, by, Western, audiences., Here’s, to, hoping, that, happens, more, often., —Jeremy, Medina, 5., Crippled, Avengers, Year:, 1978, Director:, Chang, Cheh, In, a, time, when, exploitation, cinema, seemed, the, standard, for, cheap, movie, houses, the, world, over,, no, martial, arts, flick, got, much, better, than, this, Shaw, Brothers, staple,, which, eventually, adopted, the, much, more, PC, title,, Return, of, the, 5, Deadly, Venoms., The, blind, one,, the, deaf, mute,, the, one, without, legs,, and, the, brain-damaged, “idiot”:, together,, they, make, an, unstoppable, force, of, vengeance, against, the, local, martial, arts, master, who, crippled, them,, and, his, son,, who, ironically, lost, his, arms, at, a, young, age,, and, so, sports, dart-shooting, cast-iron, facsimiles., In, other, words,, Crippled, Avengers, plays, it, cool,, allowing, our, disfigured, heroes, few, but, important, victories, for, most, of, the, film,, building, up, to, its, final, 25-minute, series, of, fight, scenes,, in, which, a, blind, man,, a, deaf, mute,, a, man, with, iron, prosthetic, legs,, and, an, acrobatic, “idiot”, combine, their, individual, strengths, to, defeat, a, kung, fu, master, with,, basically,, robot, arms., Movies, like, this, are, the, reasons, we, get, up, in, the, morning., —D.S., 4., Once, Upon, A, Time, In, China, Year:, 1991, Director:, Tsui, Hark, Undoubtedly, Tsui, Hark’s, masterpiece,, and, a, high-water, mark, for, both, historical, Asian, action, movies, and, martial, arts, cinema, in, general,, Once, Upon, A, Time, In, China, is, a, film, of, epic, scope, told, through, small, moments, and, even, smaller, gestures., Although, there, are, only, so, many, words, to, use, to, describe, how, Tsui,, in, barely, 10, years,, had, established, himself, as, an, incomparable, master, of, the, Golden, Age, of, Hong, Kong, cinema,, there, are, probably, no, words, worth, using, to, properly, convey, the, effortless, beauty, of, some, of, Tsui’s, images,, scattered, generously, throughout, this, film., Even, within, its, opening, credits,, which, quietly, observe, folk, hero, Wong, Fei-hung, (Jet, Li), as, he, trains, a, militia, to, defend, his, homeland, from, an, impending, Western, menace,, Tsui’s, knack, for, finding, near, spiritual, grace, in, the, rigors, of, martial, arts, training, is, obvious:, the, golden, sun,, the, reflective, sand,, the, silhouettes, of, healthy, bodies, against, the, surf—this, is, only, one, tiny, glimpse, of, Tsui’s, visual, prowess., That, we, then, later, get, the, privilege, of, watching, Jet, Li,, in, a, short-brimmed, straw, sunhat,, fight, off, a, gang, of, thugs, with, an, umbrella, is, a, many-splendored, thing., —D.S., 3., Enter, the, Dragon, Year:, 1973, Director:, Robert, Clouse, What, remains, to, be, said, about, Enter, the, Dragon?, Bruce, Lee’s, most, essential, film, draws, upon, the, classic, tournament, structure, to, give, a, variety, of, interesting, fights, (even, for, a, confused-looking, John, Saxon),, but, it, also, shines, in, any, of, the, other, moments, where, it’s, following, Lee, as, he, snoops, around, Han’s, fortress,, uncovering, his, drug, manufacturing, schemes., Jim, Kelly, is, also, valuable, as, a, second, talented, performer,, in, the, role, that, would, make, him, a, blaxploitation, icon., There’s, no, shortage, of, iconic, moments, and, fights,, such, as, the, final, duel, with, a, claw-handed, Han,, but, perhaps, the, best, is, when, Lee, fights, his, way, through, a, few, dozen, henchmen, in, the, bowels, of, the, fortress,, including, a, young, Jackie, Chan,, who, gets, his, neck, snapped., You’ve, also, got, to, feel, for, that, poor, mook, who, sees, Bruce, Lee, wielding, nunchucks, and, says, to, himself,, “No, problem,, I, can, take, him.”, —J.V., 2., The, 36th, Chamber, of, Shaolin, Year:, 1978, Director:, Lau, Kar-leung, And, this, is, why, any, kung, fu, fan, will, always, love, Gordon, Liu., The, 36th, Chamber, of, Shaolin, is, as, classic, as, it, gets—the, definitive, Shaolin, movie,, without, a, doubt,, and, the, source, of, Liu’s, nickname,, “Master, Killer.”, He, plays, a, young, student, who, is, wounded, when, his, school, is, culled, by, the, Manchu, government,, so, he, flees, to, the, refuge, of, the, Shaolin, temple., After, toiling, as, a, laborer,, he, is, finally, granted, the, right, to, learn, kung, fu,, which, begins, the, film’s, famous, training, sequences., It’s, the, rare, film, where, those, training, sequences, actually, outshine, the, traditional, fights,, because, they’re, just, so, beautiful,, fluid, and, inventive., In, each, of, the, 36, chambers,, San, Te, must, toil, to, discipline, his, body,, mind,, reflexes, and, will., They, make, up, the, whole, center, of, the, film,, and, are, unforgettable., The, film, just, has, a, gravitas—it, imbues, kung, fu, with, a, great, dignity,, because, true, kung, fu, can, only, be, attained, through, the, greatest, of, sacrifice., —J.V., 1., Five, Deadly, Venoms, Year:, 1978, Director:, Chang, Cheh, This, is, what, vintage, kung, fu—and, martial, arts, cinema,, with, it—is, all, about., The, mythology, alone, is, exquisite:, Five, Deadly, Venoms, is, the, first, Venom, Mob, film,, and, gave, each, of, them, a, name, for, the, rest, of, their, careers., There’s, the, blinding, speed, of, The, Centipede,, the, trickery, and, guile, of, The, Snake,, the, stinging, kicks, of, The, Scorpion,, the, wall-climbing, and, gravity-defying, acrobatics, of, The, Lizard, and, the, nigh-invincibility, of, The, Toad,, along, with, the, so-called, “hybrid, venom”, protagonist,, who, is, a, novice, in, all, of, the, styles., It’s, a, film, typical, of, both, Chang, Cheh, and, the, Shaw, Brothers—high, budget,, great, costumes,, beautiful, sets, and, stylish, action., Is, it, on, the, cheesy, side?, Sure,, but, how, many, great, martial, arts, films, are, completely, dour?, Five, Deadly, Venoms, is, emblematic, of, an, entire, era, of, Hong, Kong, cinema, and, the, joy, they, took, in, delivering, beautiful, choreography, and, timeless, stories, of, good, vs., evil., It’s, everything, that’s, wonderful, about, martial, arts., —J.V., ShareTweetSubmitPinMore, G+, LinkedIn, Tumblr, StumbleUpon, Tags, geek, kung, fu, kung, fu, movies, lists, martial, arts, martial,
