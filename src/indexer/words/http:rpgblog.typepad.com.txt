Well,, here, it, is: , I, have, decided, to, suspend, my, involvement, with, RPG , Blog, for, now. , With, a, family, and, career, to, consider,, you, only, have, so, much, time, to, spread, around. , Right, now,, I, feel, I, need, to, devote, as, much, of, my, hobby, time, as, I, can, to, Palladium's, fledgling, Megaversal, Ambassador, program. , It, is, something, I, believe, in,, something, I, want, to, make, strides, in,, and, the, best, way, I, feel, I, can, continue, to, introduce, folks, into, this, hobby.,  ,   ,   , Now,, it, isn't, as, bad, as, all, that: , I'll, still, be, doing, reviews, regularly, at, The, RPG, Site, and, RPGNet,, and, RPG, Blog, will, likely, return, as, soon, as, I, figure, out, a, format, that, is, easier, on, my, scarce, free, time. , My, email, address, will, likely, remain, the, same, for, now, as, well,, so, please,, keep, the, mail, coming--sooner, or, later,, RPG, Blog, will, return--different,, but, still, excited, about, gaming, as, ever. , Thanks, to, everyone, for, reading,, and, we'll, see, you, around, soon!, December, 04,, 2006, in, Site, Announcements, |, Permalink, |, Comments, (11), November, 13,, 2006, Quick, Announcement,  ,

believe, I've, mentioned, (repeatedly),, HinterWelt, is, one, of, my, favorite, companies,, so, let, me, take, this, opportunity, to, pimp, their, Sky, Is, Falling, sale. , For, the, next, week,, save, 50%, on, any, file, in, their, catalog. , I, would, recommend, checking, out, Roma, Imperious,, for, one, (or, if, you've, already, picked, that, up,, try, Nebulon, or, Supers, Inc., November, 07,, 2006, in, Bargains, |, Permalink, |, Comments, (1), November, 03,, 2006, Failed, Gnomish, Weaponry,  ,   ,   , While, I'm, working, on, getting, some, reviews, up,, here's, a, short, article, I, wrote, over, at, The, RPG, Site, a, while, back:, One, of, my, favorite, races, in, all, of, fantasy, gaming, has, to, be, the, gnomes., I, prefer, the, incarnation, that, sees, them, as, endless, tinkerers,, inventing, often, useless, items, for, often, invention's, sake, alone,, keepers, of, strange, technology,, the, ultimate, examples, of, inspiration, without, application., If, nothing, else,, gnomes, make, it, very, easy, to, introduce, some, unorthodox, items, and, weaponry, to, your, games., If, your, group, is, getting, bored, of, standard, longswords, and, shortbows, but, can't, afford/obtain, those, rune, weapons, yet,, perhaps, its, time, to, visit, your, friendly, local, gnomes,, who, promise, "Technology, Indistinguishable, From, Magic, Or, Your, Money, Back!", (note:, refund, offer, not, good, in, most, realms)., Here, are, a, few, of, the, more, ludicrous, items, that, have, made, appearances, at, my, table,, either, as, a, player, or, GM, through, the, years:, The, Switch-Lance, Idea:, Don't, have, the, room, to, carry, a, full, lance,, or, are, you, a, demi-human, who, just, isn't, tall, enough, to, port, one, around, when, you, aren't, riding?, The, Switch-Lance, makes, porting, about, the, lance, a, breeze, during, horseless, adventure, periods!, Simply, push, a, button, on, the, handle,, and, watch, the, Switch-Lance, expand!, Pros: , Easy, to, carry,, as, advertised. , Push-button, operation, also, allowed, for, surprise, impalement, of, enemies., Cons:, Had, a, tendency, in, gameplay,, when, the, button, was, pressed,, to, fire, out, at, a, speed, that, would, drag, small, demihumans, along, with, it, on, a, failed, strength, check., Also,, a, fumble, roll, indicated, that, the, user, accidentally, fat-fingered, the, button,, retracting, his, Switch-Lance, in, mid-melee,, leaving, him, defenseless., Character, Deaths, Caused:, 1, (plus, one, critical, injury), The, Lightning, Rod, Idea:, Perhaps, one, of, the, cruelest, tricks, ever, played, on, a, stupid, player,, the, Lightning, Rod, was, purchased, by, a, non-spell, user, who, wished, to, have, some, magic, power., He, mentioned, control, of, the, elements,, and, the, Gnomes,, misunderstanding,, provided, him, with, a, "Lightning, Rod",, a, slim,, long, metallic, wand, that, "one, only, had, to, hold, above, their, head, in, a, storm, to, witness, results"., And, so, the, very,, very, gullible, player, did., Once., Pros:, Assuming, one, can, persuade, an, enemy, to, hold, The, Lightning, Rod, over, his, head, in, an, empty, field, during, a, thunderstorm,, a, devastating, weapon., Cons: , That, didn't, happen., Character, Deaths, Caused: , 0, Melted, Eyebrow, Tally: , 2, The, Steam-Driven, Crossbow, Idea:, Marketed, by, a, gnomish, alchemist, who, felt, steam, power, could, revolutionize, the, face, of, warfare,, the, Steam-Driven, Crossbow, was, to, be, the, ultimate, weapon,, sending, heavy, shafts, shooting, across, the, battlefield, at, insane, rates, of, fire., With, only, one, of, the, puppies, (only, 16700, gold, for, the, prototype, model),, a, single, man, could, take, the, place, of, an, entire, company, of, regular, crossbowman., Pros: , Devastating, range,, incredible, power,, miraculous, rate, of, fire., Cons:, With, the, addition, of, the, steam-driven, parts,, the, crossbow, weighed, upwards, of, 420, pounds,, the, main, part, being, a, small, boiler, that, had, a, tendency, to, vent, steam, on, a, fumble, roll., Casualties:, 0.5, (a, near-death, experience, during, a, boiler, explosion)., Unhappy, Human, Customers:, 0, Happy, Ogre, Customers:, 1, Happy, Ogre, Customers, After, Said, Boiler, Explosion: , 0, And, the, less, that's, said, the, better, about, such, items, as, the, Personal, Backpack, Airship,, the, Black, Powder, Sword, Launcher,, the, Black, Powder, Sword, Launcher, Mark, II,, the, Automatic, Portable, Sword, Repair, Assembly,, and, the, infamous, Heat-Seeking, Caltrop., November, 03,, 2006, in, Miscellania, |, Permalink, |, Comments, (0), November, 02,, 2006, The, Ultimate, Game, Table, Goes, To, Auction,  ,   ,   , Thanks, to, reader, Tomas,, otherwise, I, would, have, completely, blanked, this, one. , As, featured, on, many, sites, such, as, this, one, as, well, as, publications, like, Dragon,, the, Ultimate, Game, Table, has, until, now, existed, as, a, near-masturbatory, fantasy, for, "The, GM/Gaming, Group, That, Must, Have, Everything". , According, to, agyris.net,, the, Ultimate, Game, Table, will, be, going, up, for, auction, on, e-bay, within, the, next, couple, of, weeks, (target, date: , November, 12th). , Those, of, us, without, the, disposable, income, to, compete, may, simply, console, ourselves, with, the, thought, that, such, a, thing, is, needlessly, extravagant, and, totally, unrelated, to, quality, gaming,, but, inside,, you, know, we, weep.,  ,   ,   , Some, very, cool, reviews, are, in, the, pipelines,, by, the, way--thanks, to, everyone, for, submitting, such, interesting, products, for, review! , I, know, we, get, backlogged, sometimes,, and, I, thank, you, for, your, patience., November, 02,,

entertainment, out, there, (along, with, JimBobOz's, Big, List, of, Links), recently, published, this, Top, Secret, flowchart, from, Dragon, #40. , If, that, doesn't, make, you, want, to, run, right, out, an, run, some, old-school, Spycraft,, James, Bond, 007,, Ninjas, &, Superspies,, or, Top, Secret, itself,, I'd, like, to, know, what, would.,  ,   ,  , Oh,, and, Happy, Halloween! , Hope, everyone, has, a, fun, and, safe, night, tonight. , And, please, don't, smash, my, pumpkin, this, year., October, 31,, 2006, in, Free, RPG, Resources, |, Permalink, |, Comments, (2), October, 30,, 2006, Petition, Over, Rate, Hikes,  ,   ,   , Now, I'm, fully, aware, online, petitions, usually, manage, little, aside, from, letting, folks, vent,, but, this, is, one, I, thought, I'd, bring, up, (if, for, that, reason, alone). , When, DriveThruRPG, and, RPGNow, announced, their, merger, last, week, into, OneBookShelf,, one, piece, of, baggage, included, with, that, was, that, there, would, be, a, publisher, commission, hike, (upwards, of, 30%,, I, am, informed), effective, December, 1,, 2006. , That, means, a, big, sting, to, a, lot, of, quality, pdf-only, and, pdf-using, publishers,, many, of, whom, would, likely, have, to, look, at, price, hikes, themselves. ,  ,   ,   , One, of, the, best, things, about, RPGNow, up, to, this, point, has, been, being, able, to, find, some, absolute, gems, for, as, low, as, a, buck, or, two. , DTRPG, has, traditionally, had, higher, prices,, and, that's, not, a, trend, I'd, like, to, see, carry, over. , Don't, get, me, wrong: , I'm, not, saying, this, is, the, end, of, the, world,, but, it, is, going, to, be, a, major, pain, to, a, lot, of, small, publishers. , This, petition, is, meant, to, send, a, strong, message, to, OneBookShelf, that, we,, fans, and, publishers, alike,, find, this, completely, unacceptable. , Will, they, listen? , Doubtful,, but, time, will, tell,, and, if, you, dislike, the, idea, of, publishers, and, gamers, getting, slapped, pretty, hard, with, price, hikes,, take, a, moment, and, put, your, signature, to, the, petition. , Hey,, like, I, said,, if, nothing, else,, its, a, way, to, vent,, right?, P.S.--Keep, in, mind, e23, remains, independent, and, will, be, pursuing, no, commission, hikes., October, 30,, 2006, in, Articles/News, |, Permalink, |, Comments, (10), October, 26,, 2006, Free, Tibet...the, RPG,  ,   ,   , -Vajra, Enterprises, may, not, exactly, be, a, household, name, (yet),, but, they, do, one, thing, better, than, any, other, gaming, company: , release, huge, "lite", versions, of, their, games. , They've, kept, this, up, with, a, 169-page, lite, version, of, their, Tibet, RPG. , Called, the, Monastic, Edition ,, the, game, is, fully, playable, in, this, form--and, there's, even, theme, music, and, an, instructional, video, you, can, download. , Tibet, definitely, doesn't, fit, in, your, standard, RPG, genres,, but, definitely, contains, a, lot, more, adventure, and, intrigue, than, you, might, originally, think., October, 26,, 2006, in, Free, RPGs, |, Permalink, |, Comments, (2), October, 24,, 2006, I.C.E., Motivational, Poster, Contest:, 1, Week, Left,  ,   ,   , I, was, going, to, sit, on, this, one, to, increase, my, chances, of, winning,, but, my, entries, are, pretty, much, lame,, so, here's, a, reminder: , Iron, Crown,, inspired, by, the, fakey, motivational, poster, thread, at, RPGnet,, is, sponsoring, a, motivational, poster, contest, of, their, own. , Create, the, best, motivational, poster, (the, I.C.E., crew, will, be, the, judges),, and, win, a, $50, gift, certificate, from, the, I.C.E., online, store. , Sites, like, Despair,, Inc., make, the, posters, easy, to, design,, so, the, only, part, left, to, you, is, the, whole, creative, aspect. , Better, hurry,, though--the, contest, submissions, will, only, be, accepted, through, October, 31. , The, contest, has, been, going, on, for, the, better, part, of, the, month,, and, you, can, see, the, entries, up, to, this, point, here., October, 24,, 2006, in, Articles/News, |, Permalink, |, Comments, (5), October, 23,, 2006, So, Much, For, Buffy...,  ,   ,   , Well,, I'm, back, in, the, States,, friends,, and, for, those, of, you, out, there, who, love, Eden, Studios', Buffy, and, Angel, RPGs,, I, have, some, bad, news. , It, would, seem, that, Eden, was, unable, to, come, to, an, agreement, with, Fox, to, renew, their, RPG, license, for, those, games. , This, also, means, that, the, Angel/Buffy, books, currently, in, production, will, not, see, the, light, of, day,, either,, so, no, holding, your, breath, waiting, on, those, (with, the, exception, of, Eden, Studios, Presents, #3,, I'm, told). , It's, a, good, thing, there, was, an , announcement, on, this, front;, considering, that, given, Eden's, infamous, lag, times, between, releases,, folks, may, not, have, realized, the, lines, were, cancelled, for, another, year, or, so, (I, kid!)., October, 23,, 2006, in, Articles/News, |, Permalink, |, Comments, (0), October, 19,, 2006, And, Now,, For, A, Quick, Break,  ,   ,   , Hey, kiddos,, I'm, in, the, middle, of, moving--I, fly, out, of, country, this, Saturday,, and, will, resume, my, blogging, ways, soon, thereafter, as, I, return, to, blessed, civilian, life, once, more. , In, the, meantime,, happy, gaming,, and,, as, always, if, there's, something, cool, out, there, you've, seen, (small-market,, large-market,, indie,, traditional,, whatever,, so, long, as, it, rocks),, drop, me, a, line, and, we'll, see, if, we, can't, help, get, the, word, out. , Catch, you, on, the, flip, side, (yeah,, I, still, say, that)., October, 19,, 2006, in, Site, Announcements, |, Permalink, |, Comments, (4), October, 16,, 2006, Credo,  ,   ,   , (Um....I, said, "Credo")., Anyhow,, today, is, a, bit, of, a, cop-out, post,, as, the, Zachary, Moving, Experience, goes, into, full-swing. ,  ,   ,   , Sometimes, it's, good, to, just, talk, about, what, we, believe,, right, or, wrong,, big, or, small,, fairly, or, unfairly,, and, so, I'll, point, you, to, this, thread,, where, folks, are, taking, an, opportunity, to, do, just, that. , I, think, in, certain, quarters, of, the, hobby,, folks, have, sort, of, bogged, themselves, down, into, trench, warfare,, not, willing, to, consider, moving, from, their, position,, but, at, the, same, time, afraid, to, engage, any, other, position. , Courtesy, and, decorum, can, be, wonderful, things,, but, when, people, are, worried, about, ramifications, for, speaking, out, or, are, procedurally, or, methodically, limited, to, partial,, hamstrung, arguments, and, the, same, points, over, and, over, again,, stagnation, sets, in. , That's, when, you, begin, to, see, the, same, ten, discussions, repeatedly,, each, side, edging, forth,, laying, down, the, same, worn, old, arguments,, and, retreating, into, their, trench,, and, all, of, it, curtailed, into, meritless,, meaningless, noise. ,  I, don't, know, about, you,, but, that's, not, the, type, of, community, I, want, to, be, a, part, of. , Be, willing, to, listen,, say, your, piece,, and, don't, be, afraid, to, tell, the, truth, as, you, see, it. , Consideration, still, has, its, place,, but, it, should, never, stifle, the, movement, of, ideas. , After, all,, very, few, worthy, agreements, and, accords, came, about, without, at, least, a, little, shouting., :),  ,   ,   , I, guess, you, can, add, that, to, my, credo., October, 16,, 2006, in, Miscellania, |, Permalink, |, Comments, (3), October, 15,, 2006, 0one, Games, Blueprint, Series,  ,   ,   , Today, I, want, to, do, a, review, not, of, a, single, product,, but, of, a, product, line. , Oone, Games, is, a, leader, (if, not, the, leader), in, game, maps, and, map, products,, and, I, have, nothing, but, good, things, to, say, about, their, Blueprints, series. , Each, in, this, line, presents, a, blueprint, map, of, a, structure, or, area. , Now,, I, really, enjoy, making, my, own, maps,, but, I, also, know, my, limitations. , And, the, fact, is,, when, I, look, at, something, like, The, Great, City, (free, preview, here), or, Dwarven, Stronghold,, I, see, something, that, will, not, only, impress, the, heck, out, of, my, players,, but, works, to, get, the, wheels, in, my, head, moving, as, well. , I, also, appreciate, the, fact, that, there, are, dozens, to, pick, from--some, exotic,, some, mundane,, all, really, nicely, done.,  ,   ,   , Perhaps, the, best, feature, of, these, maps, (aside, from, the, near-flawless, cartography, employed), is, the, cheap, price. , I, can, pick, up, most, maps, in, this, series, for, under, $2,, which, makes, it, perfect, for, rounding, out, the, minimum, price, at, RPGnow. , Add, a, few, of, these, to, your, wishlist,, and, I, think, before, too, long, you'll, find, you're, adding, plenty, more., October, 15,, 2006, in, Reviews, |, Permalink, |, Comments, (2), October, 14,, 2006, Bloggerheads,, Take, Note,  ,   ,   , I, know, I, haven't, recommended, many, blogs, on, my, site, (aside, from, the, ones, over, in, the, right-hand, column, there),, but, I, am, going, to, go, ahead, and, point, out, I, Waste, The, Buddha, With, My, Crossbow,, the, new(ish), blog, of, the, good, Dr., Rotwang, (heckuva, name,, I, know). ,  , Not, only, is, he, a, fellow, Hoosier,, but, he, writes, fun,, clever, bits, about, gaming, that, for, all, their, hilarity,, I, find, pretty, worthwhile. , October, 14,, 2006, in, Miscellania, |, Permalink, |, Comments, (3), October, 13,, 2006, The, RPG, Site, Companion,  ,   ,   , You, may, have, noticed, I, added, a, new, link, to, the, site: , The, RPG, Site, Companion. , This, site, includes, an, Amazon, associate, bookstore, which, is, being, filled, with, links, to, an, assortment, of, well-known, as, well, as, indie, and, small-press, games, and, RPG, book, available, through, Amazon. ,  New, titles, will, be, added , as , links, are, provided,, so, check, back, often,, and, feel, free, to, shoot, an, email, over, that, way, if, you, have, a, requested, title, you'd, like, to, see, added. , The, proceeds, from, the, store, will, pay, (hopefully), for, the, operating, costs, of, The, RPG, Site,, so, you'll, also, be, helping, out, a, forum, I've, come, to, truly, enjoy.,  ,   ,   , The, Companion, site, also, has, room, to, host, gaming, files,, if, you, have, something, you've, been, looking, to, put, online, but, haven't, had, a, way, to, get, it, hosted. , Send, your, requests, to, mccrow24(at)yahoo.com, for, more, info.,  ,   ,   , (And, yes,, I, know, my, link, jpg, isn't, exactly, overflowing, with, artistic, merit. , Hopefully, I'll, have, something, a, bit, better, for, that, at, some, point)., (/end, plug), October, 13,, 2006, in, Miscellania, |, Permalink, |, Comments, (2), October, 12,, 2006, Review, of, Steampunk, Musha, (Finally!),  ,   ,   , The, good, folks, at, Politically, Incorrect, Games, have, kept, their, quality, streak, alive, with, the, release, of, Steampunk, Musha,, a, “Victoriental, Adventures”, setting, for, Iron, Gauntlets., It’s, nice, to, see, such, an, excellent, gaming, system, as, IG, getting, plenty, of, love, and, support;, despite, its, relatively, small, size,, PIG, is, providing, as, much, and, more, support, material, for, Iron, Gauntlets, than, some, companies, 3-4, times, its, size, are, doing, for, there, lines., Steampunk, Musha, is, a, good, indicator, of, the, high, quality, of, these, releases.,  ,   ,   , My, review, copy, was, a, pdf,, some, 122, pages, in, length., SM, (as, we, will, periodically, refer, to, Steampunk, Musha), was, created, by, Rick, Hershey,, with, Brett, Bernstein, and, Alana, Abbott, (an, up-and-coming, young, authoress, who, you, might, remember, from, my, Into, The, Reach, review), doing, the, writing., The, artwork, throughout, is, more, functional, than, lush, (though, nicely, done, and, evocative),, but, the, overall, design, of, the, book, is, one, of, clarity, and, ease, of, reading.,   ,   ,   , The, world, of, Steampunk, Musha, is, very, much, one, of, tradition, fighting, to, hold, on, in, the, face, of, progress;, a, Victorian, theme, wrapped, in, fantasy,, but, definitely, a, Victorian, theme, nonetheless., However,, this, is, not, your, standard, British, Isles, steampunk;, our, setting, takes, place, in, on, the, island, of, Rosuto-Shima,, which, has, a, decidedly, Oriental, feel, to, it., The, island, (and, setting), are, completely, modular,, and, can, be, dropped, into, any, Iron, Gauntlets, campaign, because, of, it.,  ,   ,   , Rosuto-Shima, is,, as, I, said, presented, as, isolated, from, the, rest, of, the, world,, and, is, going, through, the, struggles, of, an, new, industrial, age, (which, is, where, our, steampunk, elements, enter, in)., I, was, somewhat, reminded, of, Japan, and, the, days, of, the, Meiji, Restoration)., Bernstein, and, Abbott, work, cultures, derived, from, several, oriental, nations, as, well, as, Victorian, England, to, create, cultures, that, really, do, present, excellent, chances, for, conflict, and, struggle., Among, the, themes, presented, here, is, what, is, given, up, when, industrialization, destroys, the, old, ways,, but, also, the, question, of, what, is, worth, saving, at, the, risk, of, halting, progress?,  ,   ,   , SM, is, divided, into, 7, sections., The, first, deals, with, Character, Basics,, and, provides, a, solid, introduction, to, what, is, new, for, this, Iron, Gauntlets, setting.,  ,   ,   , The, second, section, is, Character, Races., I, liked, the, fact, that, Humans, are, presented, as, a, different, race, from, the, Gaijin,, or, foreigners, (the, folks, responsible, for, much, of, the, technology, challenging, the, tradition, of, Rosuto-Shima., In, addition, to, these, two,, there, are, the, Clockwork, Ronin,, which, can, be, imbued, with, the, spirit, of, a, deceased, warrior;, the, Jinteki-Oni,, a, surprisingly, peaceful,, powerful, hybrid, of, demon, and, human;, the, Juunishi-p’o,, small,, strange, creatures, based, on, the, animal, lords, of, the, zodiac;, and, the, Keshou,, a, former, slave, race, that, is, related, to, goblins,, though, it, has, many, dwarf-like, qualities., I, was, surprised, how, much, I, enjoyed, some, of, these, races,, which, managed, not, to, fall, into, the, trap, of, most, new, fantasy, races, (you, know—“lizard, humanoid,, bird, humanoid,, octopi, humanoid,, etc.”).,  ,   ,   , Chapter, 3, deals, with, magic, and, religion,, and, how, their, perception, has, changed, with, the, arrival, of, reliable,, new, technology., The, schools, of, magic, are, a, definite, highlight,, with, the, scholarly, paths, and, Gui, (an, elemental, school, which, incorporates, the, martial, arts), being, total, coolness.,  ,   ,   , SM, goes, on, to, describe, both, traditional, and, modern,, native, and, gaijin, equipment., For, me,, this, chapter, (#4), was, the, highlight, of, the, book., The, steampunk, items, here, really, shine,, with, steamwork, mounts,, constructs,, and, weaponry, present, in, high, volumes., Gun, bunnies, will, be, happy, to, see, their, favorite, type, of, weaponry, on, display, here,, and, the, magically-inclined, will, find, enough, items, to, keep, them, in, the, ballgame.,  ,   ,   , Chapters, 5,, 6,, and, 7, sort, of, work, together,, with, a, detailed, history, of, Rosuto-Shima, being, followed, by, a, fully, illustrated, bestiary, (containing, some, great, twists, on, some, Japanese, favorites, along, with, a, few, new, beasties, altogether),, and,, of, course, (being, a, PIG, product),, a, full, chapter, of, plot, and, campaign, ideas., This, setting, may, only, be, 122, pages, in, length,, but, it, can, stand, up, to, the, big, boys, in, terms, of, quality, and, detail, with, no, problems.,  Of, course,, no, PIG, pdf, would, be, complete, without, a, character, sheet,, game, reference, sheet,, and, map., They, keep, this, up,, and, I, might, just, (gasp!), expect, this, behavior, from, all, pdf, publishers.,  ,   ,   , In, short,, Steampunk, Musha, is, more, than, just, a, standard, fantasy, setting,, and, is, definitely, not, your, run-of-the-mill, steampunk, genre, entry,, either., I, find, it, interesting, that, Iron, Gauntlets,, which, has, an, “Unorthodox”, sourcebook, series,, has, produced, an, unorthodox, setting, as, well., The, conflict, between, technology, and, the, old, ways, is, prevalent, throughout,, but, steers, far, from, becoming, cliché, or, boringly, redundant., Despite, its, unusual, premise,, the, writing, of, this, book, is, rock-solid,, and, ensures, that, Steampunk, Musha, is, another, feather, in, the, hat, of, PIG., October, 12,, 2006, in,
