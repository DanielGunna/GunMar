his, impact?, Seriously., There, were, martial, arts, films, before, him, sure,, however, he, is, the, sole, reason, the, genre, exploded, in, the, 70's,, and, well, after, his, death, to, even, today, and, for, many, more, years, to, come,, He, broke, down, racial, barriers, and, became, the, first, Asian, Superstar, the, world, has, ever, known,, His, work, ethic, and, workout, regime, was, ahead, of, its, time,, he, founded, his, own, form, of, Martial, Arts,, and, came, up, with, the, concept, of, mixing, different, aspect, from, different, forms, from, all, over, the, world, to, make, the, most, affective, use, in, any, situation,, basically, to, adapt, to, any, fighting, method,, which, went, on, to, of, course, inspire, the, UFC, &, MMA, in, general, and, for, that, reason, he, is, being, hailed, as, the, "Father, of, Mixed, Martial, Arts", and, his, impact, on, POPULAR, culture, is, incredible,, especially, with, just, 4, completed, Kung, Fu, films, under, his, belt...., Bruce, Lee, is, the, KING, of, KUNG, FU, Cinema, and, is, arguably, the, greatest, Martial, Artist, of, the, 20th, century., He, is, a, Philosopher,, a, Teacher,, A, Director,, A, Writer,, An, Actor,, A, MARTIAL, ARTIST,, An, Inspiration,, A, Family, Man,, and, A, Legend., Its, safe, to, say, he, influenced, &, inspired, EVERYONE, on, this, list., As, for, Fist, of, Fury, taking, the, top, spot,, i, can, tell, you, right, now,, it, was, a, bitch, ranking, these, films,, especially, the, Top, 10,, they, are, ALL, Masterpieces,, and, are, interchangeable, really,, it, just, so, happens, im, in, a, "Fist, of, Fury, mood", at, the, moment, and, any, of, Bruce's, films, can, and, should, be, at, the, top, anyway,, doesn't, matter, which, one,, they, are, ALL, land, marks, in, cinema, history, as, far, as, im, concerned., This, film, may, not, be, as, polished, as, many, other, films, on, this, list,, it, had, a, lower, budget, too,, and, sure,, it, feels, a, bit, dated, by, today's, standards., But, there, is, no, arguing, at, Bruce, Lee, being, a, timeless, icon., His, charisma,, influence, and, overall, skill, is, still, unmatched, today., Bottom, line, is,, there, would, be, no, Jackie, Chans,, Van, Dammes,, And/or, Jet, Lis, without, this, man, and, his, contribution, to, the, Martial, Arts, World, &, Cinema., TRIVIA:, -A, Young, Jackie, Chan, appears, as, an, Extra., -Jet, Li, Remade, the, film, as, "Fist, of, Legend.", He, then, went, on, to, film, a, "Prequel", in, the, form, of, "Fearless.", -Donnie, Yen, Also, Remade, it, for, TV, as, "Fist, Of, Fury:, Sworn,

viewing, the, DIRECTORS, CUT., The, theatrical, version, was, fine, for, casual, movie, goers, and, if, i, rank, that, version, of, the, film, on, here, it'd, be, at, #, 5,, but, if, you, fancy, yourself, a, "martial, arts, movie, fan", or, a, fan, of, GOOD, CINEMA, in, general,, pick, up, the, DIRECTORS, CUT,, the, one, that, opens, and, ends, with, a, special, cameo, by, Michelle, Yeoh,, features, a, deleted, fight, scene, with, a, Muay, Thai, Boxer,, and, additional, footage, to, help, flesh, out, the, story, more, and, develop, the, characters., The, Directors, Cut, in, my, honest, opinion, is, Jet, Li's, Masterpiece., In, it, he, expresses, in-detail, what, he, believes, is, the, true, meaning, of, "Wushu.", It, is, a, story, about, the, journey, on, takes,, Full, of, Tragedy,, Self, Growth,, Perseverance,, and, Self, Discovery., The, Directors, Cut, is, the, only, way, to, see, this, film,, the, story, is, alot, more, complete,, the, fights, uncensored,, uncut,, and, overall, the, film, is, that, much, more, Beautiful, in, comparison, to, the, butchered,, dubbed,, and, dumbed, down, version, released, in, theaters., I, highly, recommend, you, see, the, film, the,

among, others., This, is, Easily, Donnie, Yen's, BEST., The, One, he'll, be, remembered, for..., An, interesting, bit, of, Trivia, is, that,, although, Donnie, has, been, around, since, the, 80's,, 90s,, and, 00's,, occasionally, taking, part, in, gems, such, as, Hero, &, Iron, monkey,, it, wasnt, until, this, film, did, he, achieve, massive, mainstream, acceptance., In, other, words, while, his, peers, Jackie,, Jet,, &, Sammo, all, peaked, during, their, 20's,, it, wasnt, until, Donnie, reached, his, late, 30's, did, he, reach, his, "peak", career, wise, with, Ip, Man., Some, one, even, argue, he, only, got, better, with, age,, which, is, a, rare, case, in, cinema, period., This, was, the, role, he, was, born, to, play,, and, is, currently, continuing, his, winning, streak, by, releasing, some, of, the, best, martial, arts, movies, today., After, 3, decades, in, the, business,, and, with, Jackie, &, Jet, releasing, fewer, and, fewer, action, movies,, he, has, finally,

film, dozens, of, times, and, i, just, never, get, tired, of, it., Its, just, that, good., Keep, in, mind, there, are, no, Stuntmen,, Wires,, or, CGI,, everything, Jackie, does, here, and, in, most, of, his, films, are, REAL., That's, what, makes, him, the, BEST., Jackie, Chan, was, named, the, successor, to, Bruce,, and, its, not, because, he, copied, his, style,, make, no, mistake,, before,
