physical, theories, and, measurements, to, discover, the, properties, of, the, earth., The, discipline, dates, to, antiquity,, mainly, as, a, scientific, approach, to, earthquake, prediction, (a, problem, still, unsolved),, but, major, progress, began, in, the, late, 1500s, with, initial, work, in, such, areas, as, magnetism, and, gravity., Tremendous, improvements, in, instrumentation, in, the, early, years, of, the, 20th, century, generated, rapid, progress, in, geophysics, and, ultimately, led,, in, the, 1960s,, to, the, theory, of, plate, tectonics., Plate, tectonics,, the, study, of, the, interior, structure, of, the, earth,, and, such, related, areas, as, global, and, regional, processes, are, known, collectively, as, solid, earth, geophysics., The, subdiscipline, known, as, exploration, geophysics, involves, the, use, of, geophysical, theory, and, instrumentation, to, locate, petroleum, and, other, mineral, sources., Unlike, solid, earth, geophysics,, exploration, geophysics, generally, concentrates, on, finding, lateral, heterogeneities, in, a, relatively, small, part, of, the, earth's, crust., Geophysics, is, considered, by, some, to, be, a, branch, of, geology,, by, others, to, be, of, equal, rank., It, is, distinguished, from, the, other, earth, sciences, largely, by, its, use, of, instruments, to, make, direct, or, indirect, measurements, of, the, parts, of, the, Earth, being, studied,, in, contrast, to, the, more, direct, observations, which, are, typical, of, geology., The, following, definitions, are, from, Robert, E., Sheriff's, Encyclopedic, Dictionary, of, Applied, Geophysics., 1., The, study, of, the, earth, by, quantitative, physical, method,, especially, by, seismic, reflection, and, refraction,, gravity,, magnetic,, electrical,, electromagnetic,, and, radioactivity, methods., 2., The, application, of, physical, principles, to, studies, of, the, earth., Includes, the, branches, of, (a), seismology, (earthquakes, and, elastic, waves);, (b), geothermometry, (heating, of, the, earth,, heat, flow,, volcanology,, and, hot, springs);, (c), hydrology, (ground, and, surface, water,, sometimes, including, glaciology);, (d), physical, oceanography;, (e), meteorology;, (f), gravity, and, geodesy, (the, earth's, gravitational, field, and, the, size, and, form, of, the, earth);, (g), atmospheric, electricity, and, terrestrial, magnetism, (including, ionosphere,, Van, Allen, belts,, telluric, currents,, etc.);, (h), tectonophysics, (geological, processes, in, the, earth);, and, (i), exploration, and, engineering, geophysics., Geochronology, (the, dating, of, earth, history), and, geocosmogony, (the, origin, of, the, earth), are, sometimes, added, to, the, foregoing, list., 3., Often, refers, to, solid-earth, geophysics, only,, thus, excluding, (c),, (d),, (e),, and, portions, of, other, subjects, from, the, above, list., 4., Exploration, geophysics, is, the, use, of, seismic,, gravity,, magnetic,, electrical,, electromagnetic,, etc.,, methods, in, the, search, for, oil,, gas,, minerals,, water,, etc.,, with, the, objective, of, economic, exploitation.,
