Adventures, booklet:, nine, days, of, kayaking,, hiking,, white, water, rafting,, and, zip, lining, on, the, Caribbean, side, of, Costa, Rica., It, was, for, the, intrepid, traveller, but, no, experience, was, necessary., So, I, packed, up, my, creaky, bones, and, got, ready, to, immerse, myself, in, a, unique, adventure., We, were, greeted, at, San, Jose, airport, and, driven, half, an, hour, to, a, hotel, set, amid, tropical, gardens, high, above, the, city,, the, Xandari, Resort., http://www.xandari.com/colorscapes.html, We, had, time, to, walk, in, the, garden, and, take, a, dip,

August,, winter, in, Peru,, it, was, cloudy,, misty,, and, cool, during, the, day,, 60-65, degrees,, perfect, weather, for, walking., Our, private, guide,, Mariela,, took, us, to, the, historical, center, of, Lima,, the, Plaza, de, Armas,, to, see, its, colonial, buildings, and, to, the, San, Francisco, Monastery,, which, boasts, intriguing, catacombs, that, date, to, the, early, 1800s., We,

Beach, on, Collins, Avenue, and, 23rd, Street., The, hotel, was, just, weeks, old, when, we, visited, and, so, taxi, drivers, knew, it, as, the, former, Gansevoort—that, said,, you’d, never, recognize, it, as, such., As, one, enters, the, lobby, the, first, thing, one, senses, is, the, wonderful, aroma, of, wood;, my, daughter, kept, looking, around, for, the, scented, candles, but, the, smell, is, natural,, a, byproduct, of, the, building, materials, used, in, the, hotel’s, design., In, fact,, we, discovered, that, much, of, the, ash, wood, came, from, a, forest, in, Colorado, that, had, succumbed, to, a, beetle, infestation., The, 1Hotels, company, bought, the, dead, trees, and, replanted, the, forest., Eco-friendly,, recycled, materials, are, everywhere,, yet, the, result, is,
