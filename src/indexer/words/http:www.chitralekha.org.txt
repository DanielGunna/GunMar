[Mukul, Dey:, Pioneering, Indian, Graphic, Artist, — Satyasri, Ukil, Mukul, Dey, working, on, his, copper, plate, at, Chitralekha,, c., 1982, Photo:, Keisuke, InanoIndian, painter-engraver, Mukul, Chandra, Dey, (1895-1989), —, better, known, as, Mukul, Dey, —, was, an, important, personality, of, his, time., A, student, of, Rabindranath, Tagore’s, Santiniketan, School, during, the, early, years, of, the, 20th, century, (c., 1906-1912),, he, left, his, mark, as, a, pioneer, of, drypoint-etching in India., An, extremely, sensitive, artist, (perhaps, temperamental, at, times),, he, chose, an, essentially, Western, medium, to, depict, subjects, of, Indian, life, and, legends, from, a, common, man’s, viewpoint., The, river, scenes, of, Bengal,, the, baul, singers,, the, bazaars, of, Calcutta, or, the, life, of, Santhal, villages, in, Birbhum, —, all, these, attracted, his, attention, and, he, recorded, his, vision, with, deep, feeling, and, a, rare, sureness of hand., Mukul, Dey, is, also, remembered, for, his, superbly, executed, portraits, of, the, rich, and, the, famous, —, the, Tagores,, Albert, Einstein,, Mohandas, Karamchand, Gandhi,, Sven, Hedin,, the, Tatas, Drypoint, portrait, of, Abanindranath, Tagore, by, Mukul, Dey,, c., 1937., Original, print, signed, in, pencil, by, Tagore, bottom, left, corner,, both, in, Roman, and, Bengali, script., Artist’s, signature, and, seal, on, bottom, right, corner., The, seal, impression, depicts, Lord, Vishnu’s, foot-marks, Photo:, Mukul, Dey, Archivesand, many, more., Coming, from, a, family, that, had, seen, difficult, times,, he, had, to, learn, his, skills, well, for, his, survival., He, states, in, My, Reminiscences,, “In, 1918,, I, realised, a, long, cherished, dream, by, visiting, the, Ajanta, Caves., I, at, once, made, up, my, mind, to, copy, the, frescos, but, as, I, had, no, money,, I, had, to, travel, to, various, cities, of, southwestern, India, drawing, portraits, of, rich, men, and, selling, my, work, for, a, few rupees only.”, Mukul, Dey, deserves, to, be, remembered, not, only, as, an, important, practicing, artist, but, also, as, an, art, collector., Passionately, interested, in, the, various, forms, of, folk, arts, and, crafts,, as, well, as, the, works, of, his, contemporary, Neo-Bengal, School, artists,, he, was, an, intrepid, collector, and, promoter, of their creations., During, his, tenure, as, the, first, Indian, principal, of, Government, School, of, Arts,, Calcutta, (1928-1943),, Mukul, Dey, organized, at, least, two, very, important, exhibitions, at, the, school, premises.The, artists, being, Jamini, Roy, and, Rabindranath, Tagore. , Having, interacted, closely, with, such, Japanese, and, European, masters, as, Yokoyama, Taikan,, Shimomura, Kanzan,, Kampo, Arai,, Yashiro, Yukio,, Stanislav, Szukalski,, James, Blanding, Sloan,, Roi, Partridge,, Muirhead, Bone,, Frank, Short,, Henry, Tonks, and, George, Clausen,, Dey’s, horizons, had, widened, enough, for, him, to, appreciate, the, genius, of, Jamini, Roy, and, thus, sponsor, Roy’s, first, ever, solo, exhibition, in, September/October, 1929, in Calcutta., Coming, through, the, Rye,, drypoint, by, Mukul, Dey, Photo:, Mukul, Dey, ArchivesSimilarly,, much, before, the, Western, art, world, took, any, cognizance, of, Rabindranath, Tagore, as, an, artist,, Mukul, Dey, had, wanted, to, put, up, his, show, as, early, as, 1928., However,, as, Tagore, himself, was, keener, to, get, recognition, from, the, cultural, arena, of, Paris, and, Berlin, first,, this, particular, exhibition, had, to, wait, till, the, beginning of 1932., Mukul, Dey, was, my, grandfather,, and, among, my, cache, of, childhood, memories, is, the, image, of, him, sitting, at, his, desk, at, Chitralekha,, the, house, he, built, in, 1928,, amidst, a, sea, of, papers., Day, after, day,, lost, to, the, world, outside,, he, would, pore, over, them,, sifting, and, occasionally, filing, away, sketches, and, drawings,, old, photographs,, original, correspondences,, period, newspaper, clippings,, exhibition, and, collection, catalogues, and, stacks, of, very, rare, lantern, slides, of, traditional, Indian art., He, was, passionately, attached, to, papers, and, images;, these, were, things, he, could, never, destroy., For, years, together,, he, went, on, adding, to, his, mind-boggling, repository, of, visual, and textual information., This, was, unusual, for, that, time, and, place,, and, indeed, contrary, to, the, general, Indian, trait, of, ahistoricity, –, this, sense, of, history,, this, desire, to, preserve, every, tiny, fragment, of, our, cultural fabric., Over, time,, Mukul, Dey’s, priceless, collection, became, fragmented, and, scattered, all, over, Europe,, Asia, and, the, USA., A, major, part, of, his, collection, of, Kalighat, pata, paintings,, which, numbered, 451,, was, acquired, by, W.G., Archer, for, the, Victoria, and, Albert, Museum, way, back, Drypoint, tools, used, by, Mukul, Dey, Photo:, Mukul, Dey, Archivesin, the 1930s., Similarly,, his, masterful, copies, of, the, Ajanta,, Bagh,, Sigiriya, and, Sittanavasal, frescoes, went, to, the, British, Museum, and, Japan., Most, of, what, remained, in, India, decayed, and, degenerated, with, the, passage, of, time.  , Dey, never, lost, hope., He, was, hopeful, to, the, very, last, that, some, day, someone, from, his, immediate, society, would, lend, him, a, hand, to, preserve, his, collection, in, a, museum, or, a, gallery., But, it, was, a, dream, he, was, never, to, fulfill, in his lifetime., Mukul, Dey, passed, away in 1989., Midnight, Cry,, Mukul, Dey,, c., 1916-17, Photo:, Mukul, Dey, ArchivesIt, is, only, fairly, recently, that, we, have, discovered, that, all, he, left, behind, do, not, tell, his, story, alone., These, fragile, documents, are, capable, of, taking, a, researcher, on, a, rare, trip, to, a, fascinating, period, of, our, cultural, history, that, is, yet, to, be, fully, explored and interpreted., This, is, extremely, important, because, this, material, deals, with, our, immediate, past, –, a, past, that, is, not, at, all, remote, and, therefore, still, capable, of, influencing, our, present, in, a, positive, way., And,, as, they, say,, those, who, don’t, learn, from, history, are, condemned, to repeat it., Throughout, his, life, Mukul, Dey, cast, around, for, those, essentially, positive,, virile, qualities, of, traditional, Indian, art, and, culture, which, retain, their, flavour, and, relevance, over, the, passage, of, time., What, he, sought, was, an, inter-cultural, cross-fertilization, of, ideas, that, would, infuse, an, enriched, aesthetics, into, our, everyday, Seals, used, by, Mukul, Dey, Photo:, Mukul, Dey, Archivesexistence., As, Mukul, Dey, stated, in, his, January, 22,, 1932, speech, at, the, Rotary Club, Calcutta:, “There, are, in, India, at, present, three, types, of, thought, —, one, would, have, everything, European, bodily, transplanted, into, India;, another, would, have, nothing, to, do, with, anything, that, savoured, of, Europe,, the, third, was, not, afraid, to, engraft, the, best, from, foreign, sources, for, the, enrichment, of, the indigenous stock.”, Mukul, Dey’s, vision, belonged, firmly, in, the, third category.,  , Updates:, Visva-Bharati, staff, goons, assaulting, Shivashri, Ukil., Photo:, Sheikh,
