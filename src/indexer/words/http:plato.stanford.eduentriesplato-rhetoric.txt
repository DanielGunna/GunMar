revision, Thu, Feb, 4,, 2016, Plato's, discussions, of, rhetoric, and, poetry, are, both, extensive, and, influential., As, in, so, many, other, cases,, he, sets, the, agenda, for, the, subsequent, tradition., And, yet, understanding, his, remarks, about, each, of, these, topics—rhetoric, and, poetry—presents, us, with, significant, philosophical, and, interpretive, challenges., Further,, it, is, not, initially, clear, why, he, links, the, two, topics, together, so, closely, (he, suggests, that, poetry, is, a, kind, of, rhetoric)., Plato, certainly, thought, that, matters, of, the, greatest, importance, hang, in, the, balance,, as, is, clear, from, the, famous, statement, that, “there, is, an, old, quarrel, between, philosophy, and, poetry”, (Republic,, 607b5–6)., In, his, dialogues,, both, this, quarrel, and, the, related, quarrel, between, philosophy, and, rhetoric, amount, to, clashes, between, comprehensive, world-views—those, of, philosophy, on, the, one, hand,, and, of, poetry, or, rhetoric, on, the, other., What, are, these, quarrels, about?, What, does, Plato, mean, by, “poetry”, and, “rhetoric”?, The, purpose, of, this, article, is, to, analyze, his, discussions, of, rhetoric, and, poetry, as, they, are, presented, in, four, dialogues:, the, Ion,, the, Republic,, the, Gorgias,, and, the, Phaedrus., Plato, is, (perhaps, paradoxically), known, for, the, poetic, and, rhetoric, qualities, of, his, own, writings,, a, fact, which, will, also, be, discussed, in, what, follows., 1., Introduction, 2., Ion, 3., Republic,, Books, II,, III,, X, 3.1,

Inspiration,, and, Poetry, in, the, Phaedrus, 6., Plato's, Dialogues, as, Rhetoric, and, Poetry, Bibliography, Academic, Tools, Other, Internet, Resources, Related, Entries, 1., Introduction, A, good, poem, helps, to, change, the, shape, and, significance, of, the, universe,, helps, to, extend, everyone's, knowledge, of, himself, and, the, world, around, him, —Dylan, Thomas[1], When, we, think, of, a, philosophical, analysis, of, poetry,, something, like, a, treatise, on, aesthetics, comes, to, mind., At, a, minimum,, we, would, expect, a, rigorous, examination, of, the, following:, the, characteristics, that, define, poetry;, the, differences, between, kinds, of, poetry, (epic,, tragic,, lyric,, comic,, and, so, forth);, and, the, senses, in, which, poetry, is, and, is, not, bound, to, representation,, imitation,, expression, (which, are, possible, meanings, of, the, classical, Greek, word, “mimesis”), and, fiction.[2], These, complicated, terms, themselves, require, careful, definition., Equally, rigorous, and, systematic, remarks, about, the, differences, between, poetry, and, other, art, forms,, such, as, music, and, painting,, would, be, in, order,, as, would, reflection, on, the, relation, between, orally, delivered, poetry, (indeed,, if, we, are, to, include, performance,, poetry, that, is, in, one, way, or, another, enacted), and, poetry, communicated, through, the, written, word., Aristotle's, Poetics, is, an, early,, and, now, classic,, philosophical, exploration, of, poetry, along, these, sorts, of, lines., Plato's, extensive, discussions, of, poetry, frustrate, these, expectations., He, did, not, write, a, treatise, on, the, subject—indeed,, he, wrote, no, treatises,, and, confined, his, thought, to, “dramatic”, dialogues, that, are, themselves, shaped, poetically—and, the, remarks, he, offers, us, both, meander, unsystematically,, even, within, a, single, dialogue,, and, branch, off, in, what, seem, like, strange, directions,, such, as, into, discussions, about, the, corruption, of, self, to, which, poetry, allegedly, exposes, its, audience., And, yet, Plato, clearly, thought, that, something, of, enormous, importance, hangs, on, his, assessment, of, poetry,, something, that, goes, significantly, beyond, getting, the, details, of, the, subject, pinned, down, in, a, philosophically, respectable, fashion., One, of, the, most, famous, lines, in, the, culminating, sections, of, one, of, his, most, famous, dialogues, announces, that, “there, is, an, old, quarrel, between, philosophy, and, poetry”, (Rep., 607b5–6),, in, support, of, which, Plato, quotes, bits, of, several, obscure, but, furious, polemics—presumably, directed, by, poets, against, philosophers—such, as, the, accusation, that, the, opponent, is, a, “yelping, bitch, shrieking, at, her, master”, and, “great, in, the, empty, eloquence, of, fools”., [3], Indeed,, much, of, the, final, book, of, the, Republic, is, an, attack, on, poetry,, and, there, is, no, question, but, that, a, quarrel, between, philosophy, and, poetry, is, a, continuing, theme, throughout, Plato's, corpus., The, scope, of, the, quarrel,, especially, in, the, Republic,, also, indicates, that, for, Plato, what, is, at, stake, is, a, clash, between, what, we, might, call, comprehensive, world-views;, it, seems, that, matters, of, grave, importance, in, ethics,, politics,, metaphysics,, theology,, and, epistemology, are, at, stake., He, leads, up, to, the, famous, line, about, the, quarrel, by, identifying, the, addressees, of, his, critique, as, the, “praisers, of, Homer, who, say, that, this, poet, educated, Greece,, and, that, in, the, management, and, education, of, human, affairs, it, is, worthwhile, to, take, him, up, for, study, and, for, living,, by, arranging, one's, whole, life, according, to, this, poet”, (606e1–5)., The, praisers, of, Homer, treat, him, as, the, font, of, wisdom., Plato, agrees, that, Homer, is, indeed, the, educator, of, Greece,, and, immediately, adds, that, Homer, is, “the, most, poetic, and, first, of, the, tragic, poets.” , Plato, is, setting, himself, against, what, he, takes, to, be, the, entire, outlook—in, contemporary, but, not, Plato's, parlance,, the, entire, “philosophy, of, life”—he, believes, Homer, and, his, followers, have, successfully, propagated., And, since, Homer, shaped, the, popular, culture, of, the, times,, Plato, is, setting, himself, against, popular, culture, as, he, knew, it., Not, just, that:, the, quarrel, is, not, simply, between, philosophy, and, Homer,, but, philosophy, and, poetry., Plato, has, in, his, sights, all, of, “poetry,”, contending, that, its, influence, is, pervasive, and, often, harmful,, and, that, its, premises, about, nature, and, the, divine, are, mistaken., He, is, addressing, not, just, fans, of, Homer, but, fans, of, the, sort, of, thing, that, Homer, does, and, conveys., The, critique, is, presented, as, a, trans-historical, one., It, seems, that, Plato, was, the, first, to, articulate, the, quarrel, in, so, sweeping, a, fashion.[4] , It, is, noteworthy, that, in, the, Apology, (23e),, Socrates', accusers, are, said, to, include, the, poets,, whose, cause, Meletus, represents., It, is, not, easy, to, understand, what, Plato, means, by, poetry,, why, it, is, an, opponent,, whether, it, is, dangerous, because, of, its, form, or, content, or, both,, and, whether, there, is, much, of, ongoing, interest, or, relevance, in, his, account., Would, his, critique, apply, to,, say,, Shakespeare's, tragedies?, To, E., E., Cummings', or, T., S., Eliot's, poetry?, These, questions, are, complicated, by, the, fact, that, Plato, was, not, (or,, not, primarily), thinking, of, poetry, as, a, written, text, read, in, silence;, he, had, in, mind, recitations, or, performances,, often, experienced, in, the, context, of, theater., Still, further,, when, Socrates, and, Plato, conducted, their, inquiries,, poetry, was, far, more, influential, than, what, Plato, calls, “philosophy.”, Given, the, resounding, success, of, Plato's, advocacy, of, “philosophy,”, it, is, very, easy, to, forget, that, at, the, time, he, was, advocating, a, (historically), new, project, in, a, context, swirling, with, controversy, about, the, relative, value, of, such, projects, (and, indeed, about, what, “philosophy”, means)., By, contrast,, poetry, seems, relatively, marginal, in, today's, large, commercial, and, liberal, societies,, in, spite, of, the, energetic, efforts, of, figures, such, as, the, recent, American, national, Poet, Laureate, Robert, Pinsky,, whereas, media, of, which, Plato, knew, nothing—such, as, television,, videos,, and, the, cinema,, literary, forms, such, as, the, novel,, and, information, systems, such, as, the, World, Wide, Web—exercise, tremendous, influence., Television, and, movie, actors, enjoy, a, degree, of, status, and, wealth, in, modern, society, that, transcends, anything, known, in, the, ancient, world., Is, Plato's, critique, marginalized, along, with, poetry?, In, spite, of, the, harshness,, and, in, some, ways, the, bluntness, of, Plato's, critique, of, poetry,, he, not, only, put, his, finger, on, deep, issues, of, ongoing, interest,, but, also, leavened, his, polemic, in, a, number, of, intriguing, and, subtle, ways—most, obviously,, by, writing, philosophy, in, a, way, that, can,, with, proper, qualifications,, itself, be, called, poetic., The, “quarrel, between, philosophy, and, poetry”, is, justly, famed, and, pondered:, what, is, it, about?, When, we, turn, to, the, second, theme, under, consideration,, viz.,, rhetoric,, we, find, ourselves, even, more, puzzled, initially., What, do, philosophers, have, to, say, about, rhetoric? , Generally, speaking,, very, little, qua, philosophers., Like, all, reflective, people,, philosophers, dislike, rhetoric, as, it, is, commonly, practiced,, bemoan, the, decline, of, public, speech, into, mere, persuasion, and, demagoguery,, and, generally, think, of, themselves, as, avoiding, rhetoric, in, favor, of, careful, analysis, and, argument., “Rhetoric”, tends, to, have, a, very, negative, connotation,, and, for, the, most, part, means, “mere, rhetoric.” , As, an, object, of, academic, study,, the, subject, of, rhetoric, seems, best, left, to, English, professors, who, specialize, in, the, long, history, of, manuals, on, techniques, of, persuasion, and, such., Consequently,, philosophers,, especially, in, modernity,, have, had, little, to, say, about, rhetoric., By, contrast,, Aristotle, devoted, a, book, to, the, topic., And, Plato, struggles, with, rhetoric—or, sophistry, as, it, is, sometimes, also, called,, although, the, two, are, not, necessarily, identical—repeatedly., We, recall, that, Socrates, was, put, to, death, in, part, because, he, was, suspected, of, being, a, sophist,, a, clever, rhetorician, who, twists, words, and, makes, the, weaker, argument, into, the, stronger, and, teaches, others, to, do, the, same.[5] , Plato's, polemic, against, the, sophists, was, so, persuasive, that,, in, conjunction, with, a, well, established, and, ongoing, popular, hostility, towards, sophistry, (a, hostility, of, which, Socrates, was,, ironically,, also, the, object),, we, have, come, to, use, “sophist”, as, a, term, of, opprobrium, meaning, something, like, “mere, rhetorician.”, In, Plato's, dialogues, there, is, unquestionably, an, ongoing, quarrel, between, philosophy, on, the, one, hand, and, rhetoric, and, sophistry, on, the, other,, and, it, too, is, justly, famed, and, pondered., What, is, it, about?, Once, again,, the, question, is, surprisingly, difficult., It, is, not, easy, to, understand, why, the, topic, is, so, important, to, Plato,, what, the, essential, issues, in, the, quarrel, are,, and, whether, rhetoric, is, always, a, bad, thing., We, do, recognize, commendable, examples, of, rhetoric—say,, Pericles', Funeral, Oration,, Lincoln's, Gettysburg, Address,, or, Churchill's, rousing, speeches, during, World, War, II., These, were, rhetorical,, but, were, they, merely, rhetorical,, let, alone, sophistical?, Still, further,, Plato's, Socrates, is, not, above, speaking, to, his, interlocutors, rhetorically, at, times,, even, sophistically, (some, of, his, arguments, against, Thrasymachus, in, book, I, of, the, Republic, have, been, suspected, of, falling, into, the, latter, category,, and, Socrates', interlocutors, are, occasionally, reported, as, feeling, that, he, has, played, some, kind, of, verbal, trick, on, them)., And, are, not, Plato's, dialogues, themselves, rhetorical, in, significant, senses, of, the, term?, These, remarks, prompt, yet, another, question., However, interesting, the, topics, of, poetry, and, rhetoric, may, be,, when, we, read, Plato,, why, group, them, together?, Few, people, today, would, imagine, that, there, is, any, interesting, relation, between, poetry, and, rhetoric., To, think, of, great, poets, as, “rhetoricians”, seems, bizarre;, and, most, (popular), rhetoricians, do, not, seem, to, know, the, first, thing, about, poetry., Yet, Plato, himself, associates, the, two, very, closely:, at, Gorgias, 502c, he, characterizes, poetry, as, a, kind, of, rhetoric., Thus, Plato, provides, our, warrant, for, investigating, the, topics, together., This, linkage, between, poetry, and, rhetoric, is, of, course, controversial,, and, will, be, discussed, below., Quite, clearly,, our, themes, are, very, large, in, scope,, and, indeed, nearly, every, one, of, Plato's, dialogues, is, relevant, to, one, or, more, of, them., The, present, essay, will, confine, itself, to, just, four, dialogues,, the, Ion,, Republic,, Gorgias,, and, Phaedrus., I, will, discuss, them, in, that, order,, and, in, the, final, section, of, the, essay, shall, briefly, examine, the, famous, question, of, the, poetic, and, rhetorical, dimension, of, Plato's, own, writings., I, shall, look, for, connections, between, our, four, dialogues,, though, I, do, not, believe, that, our, chosen, texts, present, a, picture, of, poetry, and, rhetoric, that, is, altogether, unified, (indeed,, this, could, not, be, claimed, even, of, the, Republic, taken, by, itself)., I, will, put, aside, the, question, about, which, dialogue, Plato, composed, at, which, time,, along, with, assumptions, about, the, possible, “development”, of, Plato's, views, from, “earlier”, to, “later”, dialogues., This, is, an, example, of, an, interpretive, (or, as, it, is, sometimes, called,, a, “hermeneutical”), assumption;, every, reader, of, Plato, necessarily, commits, to, interpretive, assumptions., The, debate, about, which, assumptions, are, best, is, an, ongoing, one,, but, not, germane, to, the, present, discussion.[6], It, suffices, here, to, state, the, relevant, assumptions, made, in, this, discussion., The, identity, of, “Socrates”, is, contested;, we, have, no, writings, by, the, historical, figure,, only, writings, by, a, number, of, authors, that, in, some, sense, or, other—and, the, senses, vary, a, great, deal—are, either, about, him, or, creatively, adapt, his, name, and, aspects, of, his, story., In, referring, to, Socrates,, I, shall, mean, only, the, figure, as, represented, by, Plato;, nothing, follows,, for, present, purposes,, about, the, historical, accuracy, of, Plato's, depiction., Further,, it, is, not, the, case, that, the, views, Plato, puts, into, the, mouth, of, his, Socrates, are, necessarily, espoused, by, Plato, himself;, they, may, or, may, not, be, those, of, Plato., Since, Plato, did, not, write, a, treatise, in, his, own, voice,, telling, us, what, his, views, are,, it, is, impossible, to, know, with, certainty, which, views, he, espouses, (at, least, on, the, basis, of, the, works, he, composed)., In, several, cases,, one, of, which, will, be, examined, in, the, final, section, of, this, essay,, it, seems, reasonably, clear, that, Plato, cannot, be, espousing, without, qualification, a, view, that, his, Socrates, is, endorsing., With, these, principles, firmly, in, mind,, however,, I, shall, occasionally, refer, (as, I, already, have), to, Plato, as, presenting, this, or, that, view., For, as, author, of, all, the, statements, and, drama, of, the, dialogues,, he, does, indeed, present, the, views, in, question;, and, on, occasion, it, is, convenient, and, simpler, to, say, he, is, advocating, this, or, that, position, (for, example,, the, position, that, there, is, an, ancient, quarrel, between, philosophy, and, poetry)., 2., Ion, Ion, is, a, prize-winning, professional, reciter, of, poetry—a, “rhapsode”—and, of, Homer, in, particular.[7], Though, he, speaks, his, lines, with, the, requisite, conviction, and, emotion,, he, does, not, “imitate”, his, subjects, in, the, sense, of, act, their, parts, (of, course,, Homer, did, not, write, for, the, stage)., He, is, a, performer, but, not, a, (stage), actor., Ion, is, depicted, as, superb, at, making, the, Iliad, and, Odyssey, come, alive,, at, communicating, their, drama, to, his, audience, and, at, involving, them, intimately., We, might, say, that, he, “represents”, or, “expresses”, the, characters,, action,, and, narrative, of, Homer's, epic, poems,, and, thus, in, some, sense, both, identifies, with, his, subject, and, leads, his, audience, to, do, the, same., As, he, puts, it, in, the, dialogue, that, bears, his, name:, if, he, has, done, his, job, well,, he, will, find, himself, weeping, when, reciting, sorrowful, lines,, and, expects, to, see, his, audience, weep, along, with, him, (535b1-e6)., Both, are, somehow, transported,, thanks, to, Ion's, superb, narrative, capacity,, into, the, original, scene, (as, Socrates, says,, Ion, is, “beside, himself”, and, in, the, enthusiasm, of, the, moment, thinks, he, is, present, at, the, scene, he, is, describing;, 535b7-c3)., But, Ion, thinks, himself, capable, of, yet, more,, for, he, also, claims, to, be, an, expert, in, explaining, what, Homer, means., He's, an, exegete, (see, 531a7), or, interpreter, par, excellence,, and, this, claim, especially, intrigues, Socrates., He, does, not, permit, Ion, to, actually, exhibit, his, skills, as, a, rhapsode,, and, instead, insists, that, he, engage, in, give-and-take, about, the, abilities, Ion, claims, to, possess., This, is, typical, of, Socrates', method;, he, forces, his, interlocutor, to, give, an, account, of, his, commitments, and, way, of, life., As, both, reciter, and, exegete,, the, rhapsode, has, no, exact, analogue, today., Nonetheless,, the, implications, of, the, Ion, are, broad;, while, Ion, is, not, a, poet, himself,, he, bears, important, traits, in, common, with, the, poet., The, thrust, of, Socrates', initial, questioning, is, revealing., Essentially,, he, attempts, to, show, that, Ion, is, committed, to, several, theses, that, are, not, compatible, with, one, another,, unless, a, rather, peculiar,, saving, assumption, is, introduced., Ion, claims, that, he, is, a, first, rate, explicator, of, Homer;, that, he, is, a, first, rate, explicator, only, of, Homer,, and, loses, interest, as, well, as, competence, if, another, poet, (such, as, Hesiod), is, brought, up, (531a3–4,, 532b8–c2;, 533c4–8);, and, that, Homer, discusses, his, subjects, much, better, than, do, any, other, poets, (531d4–11,, 532a4–8)., Ion, may, justly, be, thought, of, as, one, of, the, “praisers”, of, Homer, referred, to, in, Republic, X, (see, above,, and, Ion, 542b4)., Notice, that, Socrates's, first, order, of, business, is, to, get, Ion, to, agree, that, a, number, of, claims, are, being, made, by, him;, while, this, may, seem, obvious,, it, is, an, essential, condition, for, Socrates', inquiry,, and, is, a, distinctive, characteristic, of, the, sort, of, thing, Socrates, does, as, a, philosopher., If, Ion, is, an, exegete, or, explicator, of, Homer's, poems,, he, must, surely, understand, what, the, poet, means,, else, he, could, not, explain, the, poet's, thoughts., This, seemingly, commonsensical, point, is, asserted, by, Socrates, at, the, start, (530c1–5),, and, happily, accepted, by, Ion., However,, if, Ion, understands, what, the, poet, says, about, X,, and, judges, that, the, poet, speaks, best, about, X,, he, must, be, in, a, position, to, assess, other, poets', pronouncements, about, the, subject, in, question., For, example,, Homer, talks, a, great, deal, about, how, war, is, waged;, as, an, expert, on, Homer, who, claims, that, Homer, spoke, beautifully, about, that, subject, (in, the, sense, of, got, it, right),, Ion, must, be, in, a, position, to, explain, just, how, Homer, got, it, right, and, how, Hesiod,, say,, got, it, wrong,, as, a, series, of, simple, analogies, show., If, you, can, knowledgeably, (531e10), pick, out, a, good, speaker, on, a, subject,, you, can, also, pick, out, the, bad, speaker, on, it,, since, the, precondition, of, doing, the, former, is, that, you, have, knowledge, of, the, relevant, subject, matter., But, this, seems, to, contradict, Ion's, assertion, that, he, can, explain, only, Homer,, not, the, other, poets., Let, us, recapitulate,, since, the, steps, Socrates, is, taking, are, so, important, for, his, critique, of, poetry, (it, is, noteworthy, that, at, several, junctures,, Socrates, generalizes, his, results, from, epic, to, dithyrambic,, encomiastic,, iambic,, and, lyric, poetry;, 533e5–534a7,, 534b7–c7)., To, interpret, Homer, well,, we, have, to, understand, what, Homer, said;, to, do, that,, and, to, support, our, judgment, that, he, spoke, superlatively, well,, we, have, to, understand, the, subject, matter, about, which, Homer, speaks, (just, as, we, would, in,, say,, evaluating, someone's, pronouncements, about, health)., Further,, Homer, himself, must, have, understood, well, that, about, which, he, speaks., As, interpreters, or, assessors,, we, are, claiming, to, be, experts, judging, a, claim, (in, this, case, Homer's), to, expertise,, just, as, though, we, were, members, of, a, medical, examination, board, considering, an, application, to, the, profession., So, as, interpreters, we, are, making, claims, about, the, truth, of, Homer's, teachings, about, XYZ;, and, thus, we, are, assuming, that, Homer, sought, to, state, the, truth, about, XYZ., Given, that, he, discusses, the, central, topics, of, human, and, godly, life, (531c1-d2),, it, would, seem, that, Homer, claims, to, be, wise,, and, that, as, his, devoted, encomiasts, we, too, must, be, claiming, to, be, wise, (532d6-e1)., But, claims, to, wisdom, are, subject, to, counter-claims, (the, poets, disagree, with, each, other,, as, Socrates, points, out);, and, in, order, to, adjudicate, between, them,, as, well, as, support, our, assessment, of, their, relative, merits,, we, must, open, ourselves, to, informed, discussion, both, technical, and, philosophical., Technical,, because, on, subjects, such, as, (say), war-making,, the, general, should, be, consulted, about, the, accuracy, of, Homer's, description, thereof;, philosophical, because, both, the, method, of, assessing, the, whole, (the, “Socratic, method”), and, the, comprehensive, claims, about, the, truth, made, by, interpreter, and, poet,, are, properly, philosophical, preoccupations, for, Plato., It, is, but, a, step, from, there, to, the, proposition, that, neither, Ion, nor, Homer, can, sustain, their, claims, to, knowledge,, and, therefore, could, not, sustain, the, claim, that, the, poems, are, fine, and, beautiful, works., In, passage, after, passage,, Homer, pronounces, on, subjects, that, are, the, province, of, a, specialized, techne, (art, or, skill),, that, is,, a, specialized, branch, of, knowledge., But, neither, the, rhapsode, nor, Homer, possesses, knowledge, of, all, (or, indeed, perhaps, any), of, those, specialized, branches, (generalship,, chariot, making,, medicine,, navigation,, divination,, agriculture,, fishing,, horsemanship,, cow, herding,, cithara, playing,, wool, working,, etc.)., Ion, attempts, to, resist, this, by, claiming, that, thanks, to, his, study, of, Homer,, he, knows, what, a, general, (for, example), should, say, (540d5)., Since, he, has, accepted, that, this, would, involve, possessing, the, art, of, generalship, (541e2,, techne, kai, episteme),, his, claim, is, patently, indefensible,, and, Socrates, charges, that, he, has, failed, to, make, good, on, his, assertion, to, be, “wonderfully, wise, …, about, Homer”, (542a1)., So, Ion,, and, by, extension, Homer,, are, faced, with, a, series, of, unpalatable, alternatives:, They, could, continue, to, defend, the, claim, that, they, really, do, know, the, subjects, about, which, they, discourse—in, the, sense, of, possess, the, techne, kai, episteme, of, them,, i.e.,, a, mastery, of, the, subject, matter., Yet, if, they, do, defend, that, claim, they, will, be, liable, to, examination, by, relevant, experts., They, could, admit, that, they, do, not, know, what, they, are, talking, about., This, admission, could, be, understood, in, several, ways:, (b.1), one, would, amount, to, saying, that, while, lacking, in, technical, knowledge, (knowledge, of, this, or, that, craft, or, skill),, they, do, have, knowledge, of, human, affairs—something, like, knowledge, of, human, nature,, of, how, human, life, tends, to, go,, of, the, relation, between, (say), virtue, and, happiness,, as, well, as, of, the, natures, of, both, virtue, and, happiness., To, this, might, be, added, the, claim, that, the, poets, and, their, exponents, know, the, nature, of, the, cosmos, and, of, the, divine., In, the, Republic, Socrates, in, effect, allows, them, comprehensive, claims, to, knowledge, along, those, lines,, and, then, attacks, across, the, board,, seeking, to, show, that, the, poets, have, got, it, wrong, on, all, important, counts., (b.2), alternatively,, they, could, admit, that, they, do, not, have, either, technical, or, non-technical, knowledge, of, any, of, the, topics, about, which, they, sing;, rather,, they, possess, the, skill, (techne), of, creating, beautiful,, persuasive,, and, moving, images, of, the, subjects, in, question., So, when, Ion, claims, that, Homer, speaks, beautifully, about, X,, he, just, means, that, Homer, speaks, beautifully, in, a, rhetorical, sense, even, though, he, (Homer), does, not, necessarily, know, what, he, is, talking, about., By, extension,, the, poet, would, (on, this, interpretation), make, the, same, claim, about, himself., This, would, seem, to, reduce, them, to, rhetoricians,, which, in, effect, is, what, Socrates, argues, in, the, Gorgias,, with, the, further, proviso, that, rhetoric, as, popularly, practiced, is, not, even, a, techne., Poetry-as-mere-rhetoric, is, not, a, promising, credential, for, authority, either, to, educate, all, of, Greece, or, to, better, one's, audience;, (b.2), is, not, a, position, that, poets, or, their, rhapsodes, would,, presumably,, be, eager, to, adopt., (b.3), Ion, could, admit, that, he, knows, nothing, about, the, topics, Homer, addresses,, withdrawing, his, claim, to, be, a, knowledgeable, exegete,, but, maintain, that, Homer, himself, knows, what, he's, talking, about., Ion, would, be, liable, to, the, question, as, to, how, he, knows, all, that,, however;, and, in, any, case, would, at, best, shift, Socrates', attack, to, the, real, target,, viz., Homer., (b.4), Socrates, provides, a, seemingly, more, palatable, alternative, in, the, Ion,, one, that, is, echoed, in, the, Phaedrus, (245a);, this, is, the, “peculiar,, saving, assumption”, mentioned, above., It, consists, in, the, thesis, that, Ion, recites, (and, Homer, composes), not, from, knowledge, but, from, divine, inspiration., Neither, knows, what, he, is, saying,, but, is, nonetheless, capable, of, speaking, or, composing, beautifully, thanks, to, the, divine., They, are, like, the, worshippers, of, Bacchus,, out, of, their, right, minds, (534b4–6)., This, creative, madness,, as, we, might, call, it,, they, share, with, other, Muse-inspired, artists, as, well, as, prophets, and, diviners, (534b7-d1)., This, is, supposed, to, explain, why, Ion, can, recite, only, Homer, beautifully;, he's, been, divinely, inspired, only, in, that, area,, and, that, is, all, he, means, when, he, says, that, Homer, is, better, than, his, rival, poets., Ion, has, no, argument, to, support, what, looks, like, a, comparative, assessment;, it, is, just, a, report, to, the, effect, that, he, is, “possessed”, by, Homer's, magic, thanks, to, the, work, of, a, god., A, poet,, further,, is, not, a, knower,, but, a, kind, of, transmitter, of, a, divine, spark;, he, or, she, is, “an, airy, thing,, winged, and, holy”, (534b3–4)., The, spark, is, generated, by, the, god,, and, is, passed, down, through, the, poet, to, the, rhapsode, and, then, to, the, audience., In, Socrates', unforgettable, simile,, the, relationship, of, the, god, to, poet, to, rhapsode, to, audience, is, like, a, magnetized, sequence, of, rings,, each, of, which, sticks, to, the, next, thanks, to, the, power, of, the, divine, magnet, at, the, start, (535e7–536b4),, as, though, they, were, links, in, a, chain, (as, we, might, put, it)., This, simile, helps, to, answer, an, important, question:, why, should, we, care, whether, or, not, the, poets, know, what, they, are, talking, about,, if, we, enjoy, their, compositions?, Socrates', answer, is, that, as, the, last, link, on, this, chain, of, inspiration,, we, are, capable, of, being, deeply, affected, by, poetry., We, “spectators”, at, the, recital, too, lose, our, minds,, to, some, degree,, weeping, or, laughing, as, we, enter, into, the, narrated, scene,, seemingly, forgetting, our, real, selves, and, lives, (535b2-d9)., In, the, Ion, he, doesn't, offer, a, further, explanation, of, how, this, effect, is, supposed, to, happen—for, that,, we, will, turn, to, the, Republic—but, the, important, point, is, that, it, does, happen., It, would, seem, that, the, audience, is, transformed, by, the, experience, in, a, way, that, momentarily, takes, them, out, of, themselves., Perhaps, it, does, not, leave, them, as, they, were,, for, their, understanding, of, what, properly, elicits, their, grief, or, their, laughter, would, seem, to, be, shaped, by, this, powerful, experience,, an, experience, they, presumably, repeat, many, times, throughout, childhood, and, beyond., Perhaps, they, too, start, to, believe—as, Ion, and, possibly, the, poet, do—that, they, “know”, something, thanks, to, their, contact, with, the, divine,, such, as, how, war, is, to, be, conducted, and, for, what, ends,, what, fidelity, in, love, means,, or, the, character, of, the, gods., None, of, this, would, matter, much, if, superb, poetry, left, us, unmoved,, or, in, any, case, as, we, were., Plato's, critique, depends, on, the, assumption, that, poetry, can, and, does, shape, the, soul., The, “divine, inspiration”, thesis, resolves, some, problems, for, Ion, (and, implicitly, for, Homer), while, postponing, others., One, problem, is, indicated, by, the, last, few, lines, of, the, dialogue,, where, Socrates, offers, Ion, a, choice:, either, be, human,, and, take, responsibility, for, unfairly, avoiding, his, questions, about, the, nature, of, his, (Ion's), wisdom;, or, accept, the, label, “divine”, and, subscribe, to, the, inspiration, thesis., Ion, chooses, the, latter, on, grounds, that, it, is, “lovelier.”, It, is, an, invitation, to, hybris,, of, course., How, easy, it, would, be, to, confuse, divine, and, human, madness, (to, borrow, a, distinction, from, the, Phaedrus, 244a5–245c4)!, And, not, all, of, the, contenders, for, the, prize, Ion, has, won, could, be, equally, worthy, of, promotion, to, divine, status., By, contrast,, Socrates, characterizes, himself, in, the, Apology, as, not, thinking, he, knows, what, he, does, not, know,, as, possessing, human, rather, than, divine, “wisdom.”[8], Finally,, since, the, poets, and, their, rhapsodes, both, present, views, about, how, things, are, and, ought, to, be,, and, seek, to, persuade, their, auditors, of, the, same,, they, cannot, escape, responsibility, for, the, implicit, claim, to, wisdom, and, authority, they, make., For, Plato,, this, means, that, they, must, be, held, accountable., It, is, philosophy's, mission, to, force, them, to, give, an, account, of, themselves,, and, to, examine, its, soundness., This, would, mean, that, they, are, required, to, engage, philosophy, on, its, turf,, just, as, Ion, has, somewhat, reluctantly, done., The, legitimacy, of, that, requirement, is, itself, a, point, of, contention,, it, is, one, aspect, of, the, quarrel, between, philosophy, and, poetry.[9], 3., Republic,, Books, II,, III,, X, 3.1, Republic, II, In, order, to, respond, to, the, famous, challenge, put, to, Socrates, by, Glaucon, and, Adeimantus,, it, is, necessary, to, define, justice., Socrates, suggests, that, the, task, would, be, easier, if, justice, were, first, sought, in, a, polis,, where, it, is, “writ, large.”, That, strategy, accepted,, the, polis, must, be, created, in, speech., It, turns, out, that, philosophic, guardians, are, to, rule, the, polis,, and, the, next, question, concerns, their, education, (376e2)., The, critique, of, poetry, in, the, Republic, grows, out, of, a, consideration, of, the, proper, education, (from, their, childhood, on), of, the, philosopher-guardians, in, the, “city, in, speech.”, The, context, for, the, critique, is, therefore, that, of, the, specific, project, of, the, Republic,, and, this, raises, a, question, as, to, whether, the, critique, is, meant, to, hold, whether, or, not, the, “city, in, speech”, is, possible, or, desirable., The, concern, in, book, II, is, very, much, with, the, proper, education, of, a, citizen,, as, befits, the, project, of, creating, a, model, city., The, “myth, makers”, (377b11;, Bloom, translates, “makers, of, tales”), who, supply, the, governing, stories, of, the, day, are, like, painters, (377e2), who, make, pictures, of, heroes, and, gods,, and, indeed, of, the, relations, both, among, and, between, the, two., From, the, outset,, Socrates, treats, the, poems, (those, by, Hesiod, and, Homer, are, singled, out,, but, the, critique, isn't, meant, to, be, confined, to, them), as, though, they, contained, not, just, falsehoods,, but, falsehoods, held, up, as, models, of, good, behavior., The, poems, are, taken, as, educational, and, thus, broadly, political, texts;, persuasion, (see, 378c7), of, a, class, of, the, young, is, very, much, at, stake., The, young, cannot, judge, well, what, is, true, and, false;, since, a, view, of, things, taken, on, at, early, age, is, very, hard, to, eradicate, or, change,, it, is, necessary, to, ensure, that, they, hear, only, myths, that, encourage, true, virtue, (378d7-e3)., The, pedagogic, motivation, in, question, certainly, extends, beyond, the, specific, “city, in, speech”, the, Republic, creates., Thus, while, the, critique, of, poetry, in, book, II, and, beyond, is, in, this, sense, shaped, by, the, contextual, concerns,, it, is, not, limited, to, them., Further,, Socrates, takes, aim, at, the, content, of, several, particularly, influential, poems,, and, his, arguments, against, that, content, do, not, depend,, here,, on, the, project, of, creating, the, “best, city.”, One, of, his, first, targets, is, what, he, calls, their, “theology”, (379a5–6)., Whether, in, epics,, lyrics, or, tragedies,, whether, in, meter, or, not, (379a8–9,, 380c1–2),, god, must, be, described, accurately,, and, that, turns, out, to, be, as, unchanging;, as, good, and, the, cause, of, only, good;, as, incapable, of, violence;, and, as, “altogether, simple, and, true, in, deed, and, speech,”, for, god, “doesn't, himself, change, or, deceive, others, by, illusions,, speeches,, or, the, sending, of, signs, either, in, waking, or, dreaming”, (382e8–11)., For, “there, is, no, lying, poet, in, a, god”, (382d9)., In, short,, the, gods, accurately, conceived, are, remarkably, similar, to, what, Socrates, will, subsequently, call,, in, Republic, V-VII,, the, “Ideas.”, Quite, obviously,, the, dominant, “theological”, foundation, of, the, world-view, prevalent, in, fourth, and, fifth, century, Greece—and, also, any, theological, view, that, does, not, meet, the, strictures, Socrates, specifies—must, be, abandoned., The, scope, of, the, critique, is, breathtaking., Along, the, way, Socrates, makes, yet, another, point, of, great, importance,, namely, that, the, poets, ought, not, be, permitted, to, say, that, those, punished, for, misdeeds, are, wretched;, rather,, they, must, say, that, in, paying, a, (just), penalty,, bad, men, are, benefited, by, the, god, (380b2–6)., Socrates, is, starting, to, push, against, the, theses, that, bad, people, will, flourish, or, that, good, people, can, be, harmed., The, cosmos, is, structured, in, such, a, way, as, to, support, virtue., Socrates, is, attempting, to, undermine, what, one, might, call, a, “tragic”, world, view, (note, that, in, book, X,, he, characterizes, Homer, as, the, “leader”, of, tragedy;, 598d8)., 3.2, Republic, III, In, book, III, Socrates, expands, the, argument, considerably., The, concern, now, is, squarely, with, poetry, that, encourages, virtue, in, the, souls, of, the, young., Courage, and, moderation, are, the, first, two, virtues, considered, here;, the, psychological, and, ethical, effects, of, poetry, are, now, scrutinized., The, entire, portrait, of, Hades, must, go,, since, it, is, neither, true, nor, beneficial, for, auditors, who, must, become, fearless, in, the, face, of, death., Death, is, not, the, worst, thing, there, is,, and, all, depictions, of, famous, or, (allegedly), good, men, wailing, and, lamenting, their, misfortunes, must, go, (or, at, least,, be, confined, to, unimportant, women, and, to, bad, men;, 387e9–388a3)., The, poets, must, not, imitate, (see, 388c3, for, the, term), gods, or, men, suffering, any, extremes, of, emotion,, including, hilarity,, for, the, strong, souls, are, not, overpowered, by, any, emotion,, let, along, any, bodily, desire., Nor, do, they, suffer, from, spiritual, conflict, (391c)., The, rejection, of, the, “tragic”, world, view, becomes, explicit:, neither, poets, nor, prose, writers, should, be, allowed, to, say, that, “many, happy, men, are, unjust,, and, many, wretched, ones, just,, and, that, doing, injustice, is, profitable, if, one, gets, away, with, it,, but, justice, is, someone, else's, good, and, one's, own, loss.”, Anybody, pronouncing, on, any, of, these, topics—poetically, or, not—must, say, the, opposite, (392a13-b6)., In, expanding, the, scope, of, the, relevant, discourse, so, broadly,, Socrates, in, effect, lays, down, requirements, for, all, persuasive, discourse—for, what, he, elsewhere, calls, “rhetoric”—and, makes, poetry, a, subsection, thereof., Having, covered, the, issue, of, content,, Socrates, turns, to, the, “style”, (“lexis,”, 392c6),, or, as, we, might, say,, of, the, “form”, of, myth, tellers, or, poets, (Socrates, again, runs, these, two, together)., He, does, so, in, a, way, that, marks, a, new, direction, in, the, conversation., The, issue, turns, out, to, be, of, deep, ethical, import,, because, it, concerns, the, way, in, which, poetry, affects, the, soul., Up, until, now,, the, mechanism,, so, to, speak,, has, been, vague;, now, it, becomes, a, little, bit, clearer., Poetic, myth, tellers, convey, their, thought, through, a, narrative, (diegesis), that, is, either, “simple”, (haplos), or, imitative, (that, is,, accomplished, through, “mimesis”)., The, notion, of, mimesis,, missing, from, the, Ion,, now, takes, center, stage., When, the, poet, speaks, in, his, own, voice,, the, narrative, is, “simple”;, when, he, speaks, through, a, character,, as, it, were, concealing, himself, behind, the, mask, of, one, of, his, literary, creations,, the, narrative, is, imitative, or, mimetic., For, then, the, poet, is, likening, himself, to, this, character,, and, trying, to, make, the, audience, believe, that, it's, the, character, speaking., Some, poetry, (comedy, and, tragedy, are, mentioned), proceeds, wholly, by, imitation,, another, wholly, by, simple, narration, (dithyrambs, are, mentioned),, and, epic, poetry, combines, the, two, forms, of, narrative., What, follows, this, classificatory, scheme, is, a, polemic, against, imitation., The, initial, thesis, is, that, every, person, can, do, a, fine, job, in, just, one, activity, only., Consequently,, nobody, can, do, a, fine, job, of, imitating, more, than, one, thing, (for, example,, an, actor, cannot, be, a, rhapsode,, a, comic, poet, cannot, be, a, tragic, poet,, if, any, of, these, is, finely, done)., Imitation, is, itself, something, one, does,, and, so, one, cannot, both, imitate, X, (say,, generalship), well, and, also, do, the, activity, X, in, question, (394e-395b)., It, has, to, be, said, that, this, thesis, is, set, out, with, little, real, argument., In, any, case,, the, best, souls, (the, guardians,, in, this, case,, in, the, city, in, speech), ought, not, imitate, anything., And, were, they, to, imitate, anything,, every, care, must, be, taken, that, they, are, ennobled, rather, than, degraded, as, a, result., Why?, If, imitations, “are, practiced, continually, from, youth, onwards,”, they, “become, established, as, habits, and, nature,, in, body, and, sounds, and, in, thought”, (395d1–3)., Unlike, simple, narrative,, mimesis, poses, a, particular, psychic, danger,, because, as, the, speaker, of, the, narrative, one, may, take, on, the, character, of, literary, persona, in, question., It, is, as, though, the, fictionality, of, the, persona, is, forgotten;, in, acting, out, a, part, one, acts, the, part,, and, then, one, begins, to, act, (in, “real, life”), as, the, character, would, act., One, does, not, actually, take, oneself, to, be, the, fictional, character;, rather,, the, “model”, or, pattern, of, response, or, sentiment, or, thought, one, has, acted, out, when, “imitating”, the, character, becomes, enacted., There, is, no, airtight, barrier, between, throwing, yourself, (especially, habitually), into, a, certain, part,, body, and, soul,, and, being, molded, by, the, part;, no, firm, boundary,, in, that, sense,, between, what, happens, on, and, off, the, stage., By, contrast,, Socrates, argues,, a, simple, narration, preserves, distance, between, narrator, and, narrated., Before, passing, onto, critiques, of, music, and, gymnastic,, Socrates, concludes, this, section, of, his, critique, of, poetry, with, the, stipulation, that, a, poet, who, imitates, all, things, (both, good, and, bad), in, all, styles, cannot, be, admitted, into, the, good, polis.[10], However,, a, more, “austere”, poet, and, myth, teller, is, admissible,, for, he, confines, himself, to, imitating, decent, people, (when, he, imitates, at, all,, presumably, as, infrequently, as, possible),, thus, speaking, pretty, much, in, the, same, tone, and, rhythm,, and, who, accurately, represents, the, nature, of, the, gods,, heroes,, virtue,, and, other, issues, discussed, in, books, II, and, III, (398a1-b4).[11], This, critique, of, mimetic, poetry, has, struck, not, a, few, readers, as, a, bit, strange, and, obtuse,, even, putting, aside, the, question, of, the, legitimacy, of, censorship, of, the, arts., It, seems, not, to, distinguish, between, the, poet,, the, reciter, of, the, poem,, and, the, audience;, no, spectatorial, distance, is, allowed, to, the, audience;, and, the, author, is, allowed, little, distance, from, the, characters, he, is, representing., All, become, the, speakers, or, performers, of, the, poem, when, they, say, or, think, the, lines;, and, speaking, the, poem,, taking, it, on, as, it, were,, is, alleged, to, have, real, effects, on, one's, dispositions., 3.3, Republic, X, In, book, II, the, critique, of, poetry, focused, on, mimesis, understood, as, representation;, the, fundamental, point, was, that, poets, misrepresent, the, nature, of, the, subjects, about, which, they, write, (e.g.,, the, gods)., They, do, not, produce, a, true, likeness, of, their, topics., In, book, III,, the, focus, shifts, to, mimesis, understood, as, what, one, commentator, has, called, “impersonation”;, participating, in, the, “imitation”, by, taking, on, the, characters, imitated, was, viewed, as, corrupting, in, all, but, a, few, cases, of, poetic, mimesis.[12], Surprisingly,, in, book, X, Socrates, turns, back, to, the, critique, of, poetry;, even, more, surprisingly,, he, not, only, mischaracterizes, the, results, of, the, earlier, discussion, (at, 595a5, he, claims, that, all, of, poetry, that, was, imitative, was, banished,, whereas, only, part, of, it, was, banished;, 398a1-b4),, but, recasts, the, critique, in, very, different, terms., This, is, due, in, part, to, the, fact, that, the, intervening, discussion, has, seen, the, introduction, of, the, “theory, of, Forms,”, a, more, elaborate, analysis, of, the, nature, of, the, soul,, and, a, detailed, description, of, the, nature, of, philosophy., The, renewed, criticism, leads, up, to, the, famous, statement, that, there, exists, an, ancient, quarrel, between, poetry, and, philosophy., Book, X, starts, us, off, with, a, reaffirmation, of, a, main, deficiency, of, poets:, their, products, “maim, the, thought, of, those, who, hear, them.”, And, by, means, of, the, following, schema,, this, is, now, connected, to, a, development, of, the, allegation, (repeated, at, 602b6–8), that, poets, do, not, know, what, they, are, talking, about., Socrates, posits, that, there, are, Forms, (or, Ideas), of, beds, and, tables,, the, maker, of, which, is, a, god;, there, are, imitations, thereof,, namely, beds, and, tables,, produced, by, craftsmen, (such, as, carpenters), who, behold, the, Forms, (as, though, they, were, looking, at, blueprints);, thirdly,, there, are, imitators, of, the, products, of, the, craftsmen,, who,, like, painters,, create, a, kind, of, image, of, these, objects, in, the, world, of, becoming., The, tripartite, schema, presents, the, interpreter, with, many, problems.[13], Certainly,, Socrates, does, not, literally, mean, that, poets, paint, verbal, pictures, of, beds, and, tables., Subsequently,, the, scheme, is, elaborated, so, as, to, replace, the, craftsmen, with, those, who, produce, opinion, in, the, city, (legislators,, educators,, military, commanders,, among, others),, and, the, painters, with, “the, first, teacher, and, leader, of, all, these, fine, tragic, things”, (595b10-c2),, that, is,, Homer., The, poets, are, therefore, “at, the, third, generation, from, nature”, or, “third, from, a, king, and, the, truth”, (597e3–4,, 6–7)., Let, us, focus, on, one, of, the, implications, of, this, schema,, about, which, Socrates, is, quite, specific., The, poets, don't, know, the, originals, of, (i.e.,, the, truth, about), the, topics, about, which, they, discourse;, they, appear, to, be, ignorant, of, that, fact;, and, even, worse,, just, as, a, trompe-l'oeil, painting, can, deceive, the, naïve, onlooker, into, believing, that, the, imitation, is, the, original,, so, too, those, who, take, in, poetry, believe, they, are, being, given, truth., Imitation, now, starts, to, take, on, the, sense, of, “counterfeit.”[14], Unequipped, to, put, claims, to, knowledge, to, the, test,, the, audience, buys, into, the, comprehensive, picture, of, “all, arts, and, all, things, human, that, have, to, do, with, virtue, and, vice,, and, the, divine, things, too”, that, the, poet, so, persuasively, articulates, (598b-599a)., The, fundamental, point, is, by, now, familiar, to, us:, “For, it, is, necessary, that, the, good, poet,, if, he, is, going, to, make, fair, poems, about, the, things, his, poetry, concerns,, be, in, possession, of, knowledge, when, he, makes, his, poems”, (598e3–5)., Even, putting, aside, all, of, the, matters, relating, to, arts, and, crafts, (technai, such, as, medicine),, and, focusing, on, the, greatest, and, most, important, things—above, all,, the, governance, of, societies, and, the, education, of, a, human, being—Homer, simply, does, not, stand, up, to, examination, (599c-600e)., All, those, “skilled, in, making”, (tous, poietikous),, along, with, this, educator, of, Greece, and, leader, of, the, tragic, poets,, are, painted, as, “imitators, of, phantoms, of, virtue, and, of, the, other, subjects, of, their, making”, (600e4–6)., And, what,, apart, from, their, own, ignorance, of, the, truth,, governs, their, very, partial, perspective, on, the, world, of, becoming?, Socrates, implies, that, they, pander, to, their, audience,, to, the, hoi, polloi, (602b3–4)., This, links, them, to, the, rhetoricians, as, Socrates, describes, them, in, the, Gorgias., At, the, same, time,, they, take, advantage, of, that, part, in, us, the, hoi, polloi, are, governed, by;, here, Socrates, attempts, to, bring, his, discussion, of, psychology,, presented, since, book, III,, to, bear., The, ensuing, discussion, is, remarkable, in, the, way, in, which, it, elaborates, on, these, theses., The, example, which, introduces, the, last, stage, of, Socrates', critique, of, poetry, prior, to, the, famous, announcement, of, the, “quarrel”, is, that, of, deep, human, suffering;, specifically,, a, parent's, loss, of, a, child, (603e3–5)., How, would, a, decent, person, respond, to, such, a, calamity?, He, would, fight, the, pain,, hold, out, against, it, as, much, as, possible,, not, let, himself, be, seen, when, in, pain,, would, be, ashamed, to, make, a, scene,, and, would, keep, as, “quiet, as, possible”, knowing, that, none, of, the, human, things, is, “worthy, of, great, seriousness.”, Being, in, pain, impedes, the, rule, of, reason,, which, dictates, that, when, we, are, dealt, misfortunes,, we, must, be, as, unaffected, by, them, as, possible,, preserving, the, harmony, of, our, souls, (603e-604e)., Socrates, sketches, the, character, of, the, decent, and, good, person, this, way:, “the, prudent, and, quiet, character,, which, is, always, nearly, equal, to, itself,, is, neither, easily, imitated, nor,, when, imitated,, easily, understood,, especially, by, a, festive, assembly, where, all, sorts, of, human, beings, are, gathered, in, a, theater., For, imitation, is, of, a, condition, that, is, surely, alien, to, them”, (604e)., This, may, be, a, sketch, of, Socrates, himself,, whose, imitation, Plato, has, produced.[15], By, contrast,, the, tragic, imitators, excel, at, portraying, the, psychic, conflicts, of, people, who, are, suffering, and, who, do, not, even, attempt, to, respond, philosophically., Since, their, audience, consists, of, people, whose, own, selves, are, in, that, sort, of, condition, too,, imitators, and, audience, are, locked, into, a, sort, of, mutually, reinforcing, picture, of, the, human, condition., Both, are, captured, by, that, part, of, themselves, given, to, the, non-rational, or, irrational;, both, are, most, interested, in, the, condition, of, internal, conflict., The, poet, “awakens, this, part, of, the, soul, and, nourishes, it,”, producing, a, disordered, psychic, regime, or, constitution, (politeia,, 605b7–8;, compare, this, language, to, that, of, the, passages, at, the, end, of, book, IX, of, the, Republic)., The, “childish”, part, of, the, soul, that, revels, in, the, poet's, pictures, cannot, distinguish, truth, from, reality;, it, uncritically, grants, the, poet's, authority, to, tell, it, like, it, is., Onlookers, become, emotively, involved, in, the, poet's, drama., Another, remarkable, passage, follows:, “Listen, and, consider., When, even, the, best, of, us, hear, Homer, or, any, other, of, the, tragic, poets, imitating, one, of, the, heroes, in, mourning, and, making, quite, an, extended, speech, with, lamentation,, or,, if, you, like,, singing, and, beating, his, breast,, you, know, that, we, enjoy, it, and, that, we, give, ourselves, over, to, following, the, imitation;, suffering, along, [‘sympaschontes’,, a, word, related, to, another, Greek, word,, ‘sympatheia’], with, the, hero, in, all, seriousness,, we, praise, as, a, good, poet, the, man, who, most, puts, us, in, this, state”, (605c10-d5)., So, the, danger, posed, by, poetry, is, great,, for, it, appeals, to, something, to, which, even, the, best—the, most, philosophical—are, liable,, and, induces, a, dream-like,, uncritical, state, in, which, we, lose, ourselves, in, the, emotions, in, question, (above, all,, in, sorrow,, grief,, anger,, resentment)., As, one, commentator, aptly, puts, it,, “on, the, one, hand,, poetry, promotes, intrapsychic, conflict;, on, the, other,, it, keeps, us, unconscious, of, that, conflict,, for, the, irrational, part, of, our, psyche, cannot, hear, reason's, corrections., That, is, why, poetry,, with, its, throbbing, rhythms, and, beating, of, breasts,, appeals, equally, to, the, nondescript, mob, in, the, theater, and, to, the, best, among, us., But, if, poetry, goes, straight, to, the, lower, part, of, the, psyche,, that, is, where, it, must, come, from.”[16], Further,, the, picture, of, the, gods, that, the, Greek, poets, painted, was, a, projection, of, the, tumultuous, and, conflictual, lower, parts, of, the, soul,, one, which, in, turn, gave, sustenance, and, power, to, those, very, same, parts, of, the, soul., The, worry,, then,, is, that, in, experiencing, the, emotions, vicariously—by, identifying,, so, to, speak,, with, the, drama—we, release, emotions, better, regulated, by, reason,, and, become, captive, to, them, in, “real”, life., In, a, psychological, sense,, drama, supplies, what, today, we, would, call, “role, models.”, Socrates', point, is, not, that, we, think, the, drama, is, itself, real,, as, though, we, cannot, distinguish, between, what, takes, place, on, and, off, the, stage;, but, that, “the, enjoyment, of, other, people's, sufferings, has, a, necessary, effect, on, one's, own.”, Why?, “For, the, pitying, part, [of, the, soul],, fed, strong, on, these, examples,, is, not, easily, held, down, in, one's, own, sufferings”, (606b).[17], And, this, applies, to, comedy, as, well;, we, get, used, to, hearing, shameful, things, in, comic, imitation,, stop, feeling, ashamed, at, them,, and, indeed, begin, to, enjoy, them, (606c).[18], Socrates, quite, explicitly, is, denying, that, aesthetic, “pleasure”, (606b4), can, be, insulated, from, the, ethical, effects, of, poetry., To, put, the, point, with, a, slight, risk, of, anachronism, (since, Plato, does, not, have, a, term, corresponding, to, our, “aesthetics”),, he, does, not, think, that, aesthetics, is, separable, from, ethics., He, does, not, separate, knowledge, of, beauty, and, knowledge, of, good., It, is, as, though, the, pleasure, we, take, in, the, representation, of, sorrow, on, the, stage, will—because, it, is, pleasure, in, that, which, the, representation, represents, (and, not, just, a, representation, on, the, stage, or, in, a, poem)—transmute, into, pleasure, in, the, expression, of, sorrow, in, life., And, that, is, not, only, an, ethical, effect,, but, a, bad, one,, for, Plato., These, are, ingredients, of, his, disagreements, on, the, subject, with, Aristotle,, as, well, as, with, myriad, thinkers, since, then.[19], He, is, asserting,, though, without, filling, out, the, psychological, mechanisms, in, the, detail, for, which, one, would, wish,, that, from, childhood, up,, mimesis, shapes, our, images, and, our, fantasies,, our, unconscious, or, semi-conscious, pictures, and, feelings,, and, thereby, shapes, our, characters,, especially, that, part, of, our, nature, prone, to, what, he, thinks, of, as, irrational, or, non-rational., The, poets, help, enslave, even, the, best, of, us, to, the, lower, parts, of, our, soul;, and, just, insofar, as, they, do, so,, they, must, be, kept, out, of, any, community, that, wishes, to, be, free, and, virtuous., Famously,, or, notoriously,, Plato, refuses, to, countenance, a, firm, separation, between, the, private, and, the, public,, between, the, virtue, of, the, one, and, the, regulation, of, the, other., What, goes, on, in, the, theater,, in, your, home,, in, your, fantasy, life,, are, connected., Poetry, unregulated, by, philosophy, is, a, danger, to, soul, and, community.[20], 3.4, Concluding, Observations, about, the, Republic's, “quarrel”, The, argument, in, book, X, cuts, across, all, forms, of, “poetry,”, whether, tragic,, comic,, lyric,, in, meter, or, not;, indeed,, the, earlier, distinction, between, imitative, and, narrative, poetry, too, seems, irrelevant, here., The, conclusion, is, the, same:, “We, are,, at, all, events,, aware, that, such, poetry, mustn't, be, taken, seriously, as, a, serious, thing, laying, hold, of, truth,, but, that, the, man, who, hears, it, must, be, careful,, fearing, for, the, regime, in, himself,, and, must, hold, what, we, have, said, about, poetry”, (608a6-b2)., So, sweeping, a, conclusion, makes, many, assumptions,, of, course,, one, of, which, is, that, there, is, such, as, thing, as, “truth”, out, there,, and, the, theory, of, Forms, or, Ideas, is, part, of, the, metaphysical, foundation, of, that, view., The, poets, have, been, characterized, as, making, claims, to, truth,, to, telling, it, like, it, is,, that, are, in, fact—contrary, to, appearances—little, more, than, the, poet's, unargued, imaginative, projections, whose, tenability, is, established, by, their, ability, to, command, the, applause, of, the, audience., That, is,, the, poets, are, rhetoricians, who, are,, as, it, were,, selling, their, products, to, as, large, a, market, as, possible,, in, the, hope, of, gaining, repute, and, influence., The, tripartite, schema, of, Idea,, artifact,, and, imitator, is, as, much, about, making, as, it, is, about, imitation., Making, is, a, continual, thread, through, all, three, levels, of, the, schema., The, Ideas, too, are, said, to, be, made,, even, though, that, is, entirely, inconsistent, with, the, doctrine, of, Ideas, as, eternal, expressed, earlier, in, the, Republic, itself, (and, in, all, the, other, Platonic, dialogues)., The, suggestion, is, arguably, that, the, poets, are, makers, (see, also, 599a2–3,, where, we, are, told, that, poets, “produce, appearances,”, as, one, might, translate),, that, they, move, in, a, world, permeated, by, making., The, word, “poetry”, in, Platonic, Greek, comes, from, the, word, “to, make”, (poiein),, a, fact, upon, which, Socrates, remarks, in, the, Symposium.[21], Making, takes, place, in, and, contributes, to, the, world, of, becoming., Philosophers,, by, contrast,, are, presented, as, committed, to, the, pursuit, of, truth, that, is, already, “out, there,”, independently, of, the, mind, and, the, world, of, becoming., Their, effort, has, to, do, with, discovery, rather, than, making., Thus, stated, the, contrast, is, crude,, since, poets, also, reflect, what, they, take, their, audience, to, (want, to), feel, or, believe—they, “imitate”, in, the, sense, of, represent, as, well, as, express—and, philosophers, make, speeches, and, (as, Socrates, himself, says), they, too, imitate.[22], Nonetheless,, the, distinction, suggests, an, interesting, possibility,, viz., that, the, quarrel, between, poetry, and, philosophy, is, finally,, in, Plato's, eyes,, about, the, relative, priority, of, making, and, discovery., The, making/discovery, distinction, chimes, with, a, number, of, the, dichotomies, upon, which, we, have, touched:, imagination, vs., reason,, emotion, vs., principle,, becoming, vs., being,, artifacts, vs., Forms,, images, vs., originals., Nowhere, in, the, Republic, does, Socrates, mention, the, poet's, claim, to, inspiration., Indeed,, that, claim, is, pointedly, omitted, in, the, passage, in, which, Socrates, talks, about, the, beginnings, of, the, Iliad, (392e2–393a5;, see, Bloom's, note, ad, loc)., Socrates, implicitly, denies, the, soundness, of, that, claim, here., Given, his, conception, of, the, divine, as, Idea,, such, a, claim, could, not, be, true,, since, the, Ideas, do, not, speak,, let, alone, speak, the, things, which, Homer,, Hesiod,, and, their, followers, recount., The, result, is, that, the, poets, are, fabricators, even, of, the, appearance, of, knowing, what, they, are, talking, about;, this, is, not, inconsistent, with, the, Ion's, characterization, of, poetry, as, inspired, ignorance., Does, the, critique, of, poetry, in, the, Republic, extend, beyond, the, project, of, founding, the, just, city, in, speech?, I, have, already, suggested, an, affirmative, answer, when, discussing, book, II., The, concerns, about, poetry, expressed, in, books, III, and, X, would, also, extend, beyond, the, immediate, project, of, the, dialogue,, if, they, carry, any, water, at, all,, even, though, the, targets, Plato, names, are, of, course, taken, from, his, own, times., It, has, been, argued, that, the, authority, to, speak, truth, that, poets, claim, is, shared, by, many, widely, esteemed, poets, since, then.[23], It, has, also, been, argued, that, the, debate, about, the, effects, on, the, audience, of, poetry, continues,, except, that, today, it, is, not, so, much, poets, strictly, speaking,, but, the, makers, of, others, sorts, of, images, in, the, “mass, media,”, who, are, the, culprits., Controversies, about,, say,, the, effects, of, graphic, depictions, of, violence,, of, the, degradation, of, women,, and, of, sex,, echo, the, Platonic, worries, about, the, ethical, and, social, effects, of, art., At, least, in, cases, such, as, these,, we, retain, Plato's, skepticism, about, the, notion, of, “aesthetic, distance.”[24], 4., Gorgias, The, Gorgias, is, one, of, Plato's, most, bitter, dialogues, in, that, the, exchanges, are, at, times, full, of, anger,, of, uncompromising, disagreement,, plenty, of, misunderstanding,, and, cutting, rhetoric., In, these, respects, it, goes, beyond, even, the, Protagoras,, a, dialogue, that, depicts, a, hostile, confrontation, between, Socrates, and, the, renowned, sophist, by, the, same, name.[25], The, quarrel, between, philosophy, and, rhetoric, shows, itself, as, an, ugly, fight, in, the, Gorgias., What, is, the, fight, about?, Socrates, asks, Gorgias, to, define, what, it, is, that, he, does,, that, is,, to, define, rhetoric., And, he, asks, him, to, do, it, in, a, way, that, helps, to, distinguish, rhetorical, from, philosophical, discourse:, the, former, produces, speeches, of, praise, and, blame,, the, latter, answers, questions, through, the, give, and, take, of, discussion, (dialegesthai,, 448d10), in, an, effort, to, arrive, at, a, concise, definition,, and, more, broadly,, with, the, intent, to, understand, the, subject., The, philosopher, is, happy, to, be, refuted, if, that, leads, to, better, understanding;, wisdom,, and, not, just, striving, to, “win”, the, argument,, is, the, goal, (457e-458a)., Gorgias, is, forced, by, successive, challenges, to, move, from, the, view, that, rhetoric, is, concerned, with, words, (speeches), to, the, view, that, its, activity, and, effectiveness, happen, only, in, and, through, words, (unlike, the, manual, arts), to, the, view, that, its, object, is, the, greatest, of, human, concerns,, namely, freedom., Rhetoric, is, “the, source, of, freedom, for, humankind, itself, and, at, the, same, time, it, is, for, each, person, the, source, of, rule, over, others, in, one's, own, city”, (452d6–8)., This, freedom, is, a, kind, of, power, produced, by, the, ability, to, persuade, others, to, do, one's, bidding;, “rhetoric, is, a, producer, of, persuasion., Its, whole, business, comes, to, that,, and, that's, the, long, and, short, of, it”, (453a2–3)., But, persuasion, about, what, exactly?, Gorgias', answer, is:, about, matters, concerning, justice, and, injustice, (454b7)., But, surely, there, are, two, kinds, of, persuasion,, one, that, instills, beliefs, merely,, and, another, that, produces, knowledge;, it, is, the, former, only, with, which, rhetoric, is, concerned., The, analogy, of, this, argument, to, the, critique, of, poetry, is, already, clear;, in, both, cases,, Socrates, wants, to, argue, that, the, speaker, is, not, a, truth, speaker,, and, does, not, convey, knowledge, to, his, audience., As, already, noted,, Socrates, classifies, poetry, (dithyrambic, and, tragic, poetry, are, named), as, a, species, of, rhetoric., Its, goal, is, to, gratify, and, please, the, spectator,, or, differently, put,, it, is, just, a, kind, of, flattery., Strip, away, the, rhythm, and, meter,, and, you, have, plain, prose, directed, at, the, mob., It's, a, kind, of, public, speaking,, that's, all, (502a6-c12)., The, rhetorician, is, a, maker, of, beliefs, in, the, souls, of, his, auditors, (455a3–4)., And, without, that, skill—here, Gorgias, begins, to, wax, at, length, and, eloquently—other, arts, (such, as, medicine), cannot, do, their, work, effectively, (456b, ff.)., Rhetoric, is, a, comprehensive, art., But, Gorgias, offers, a, crucial, qualification, that, turns, out, to, contribute, to, his, downfall:, rhetoric, should, not, be, used, against, any, and, everybody,, any, more, than, skill, in, boxing, should, be., Although, the, rhetorician, teaches, others, to, use, the, skill, justly,, it, is, always, possible, for, the, student, to, misuse, it., This, is, followed, by, another, damaging, admission:, the, rhetorician, knows, what, justice,, injustice,, and, other, moral, qualities, are,, and, teaches, them, to, the, student, if, the, student, is, ignorant, of, them, (460a)., It, would, follow, that,, in, Socrates', language,, the, true, rhetorician, is, a, philosopher;, and, in, fact, that, is, a, position, Socrates, takes, in, the, Phaedrus., But, Gorgias, is, not, a, philosopher, and, does, not, in, fact, know—cannot, give, an, account, of—the, moral, qualities, in, question., So, his, art, is, all, about, appearing,, in, the, eyes, of, the, ignorant,, to, know, about, these, topics,, and, then, persuading, them, as, is, expedient, (cf., 459d-e)., But, this, is, not, something, Gorgias, wishes, to, admit;, indeed,, he, allows, himself, to, agree, that, since, the, rhetorician, knows, what, justice, is,, he, must, be, a, just, man, and, therefore, acts, justly, (460b-c)., He, is, caught, in, a, contradiction:, he, claimed, that, a, student, who, had, acquired, the, art, of, rhetoric, could, use, it, unjustly,, but, now, claims, that, the, rhetorician, could, not, commit, injustice., All, this, is, just, too, much, for, Gorgias', student, Polus,, whose, angry, intervention, marks, the, second, and, much, more, bitter, stage, of, the, dialogue, (461b3)., A, new, point, emerges, that, is, consistent, with, the, claim, that, rhetoricians, do, not, know, or, convey, knowledge,, viz., that, it, is, not, an, art, or, craft, (techne), but, a, mere, knack, (empeiria,, or, experience)., Socrates, adds, that, its, object, is, to, produce, gratification., To, develop, the, point,, Socrates, produces, a, striking, schema, distinguishing, between, care, of, the, body, and, care, of, the, soul., Medicine, and, gymnastics, truly, care, for, the, body,, cookery, and, cosmetics, pretend, to, but, do, not., Politics, is, the, art, that, cares, for, the, soul;, justice, and, legislation, are, its, branches,, and, the, imitations, of, each, are, rhetoric, and, sophistry., As, medicine, stands, to, cookery,, so, justice, to, rhetoric;, as, gymnastics, to, cosmetics,, so, legislation, to, sophistry., The, true, forms, of, caring, are, arts, (technai), aiming, at, the, good;, the, false,, knacks, aiming, at, pleasure, (464b-465d)., Let, us, note, that, sophistry, and, rhetoric, are, very, closely, allied, here;, Socrates, notes, that, they, are, distinct, but, closely, related, and, therefore, often, confused, by, people, (465c)., What, exactly, their, distinction, consists, in, is, not, clear,, either, in, Plato's, discussions, of, the, matter,, or, historically., Socrates's, polemic, here, is, intended, to, apply, to, them, both,, as, both, are, (alleged), to, amount, to, a, knack, for, persuasion, of, the, ignorant, by, the, ignorant, with, a, view, to, producing, pleasure, in, the, audience, and, the, pleasures, of, power, for, the, speaker., Socrates', ensuing, argument, with, Polus, is, complicated, and, long., The, nub, of, the, matter, concerns, the, relation, between, power, and, justice., For, Polus,, the, person, who, has, power, and, wields, it, successfully, is, happy., For, Socrates,, a, person, is, happy, only, if, he, or, she, is, (morally), good,, and, an, unjust, or, evil, person, is, wretched—all, the, more, so,, indeed,, if, they, escape, punishment, for, their, misdeeds., Polus, finds, this, position, “absurd”, (473a1),, and, challenges, Socrates, to, take, a, poll, of, all, present, to, confirm, the, point., In, sum:, Plato's, suggestion, is, that, rhetoric, and, sophistry, are, tied, to, substantive, theses, about, the, irrelevance, of, moral, truth, to, the, happy, life;, about, the, conventionality, or, relativity, of, morals;, and, about, the, irrelevance, of, the, sort, of, inquiry, into, the, truth, of, the, matter, (as, distinguished, from, opinions, or, the, results, of, polls), upon, which, Socrates, keeps, insisting., Socrates, argues, for, some, of, his, most, famous, theses, along, the, way,, such, as, the, view, that, “the, one, who, does, what's, unjust, is, always, more, miserable, than, the, one, who, suffers, it,, and, the, one, who, avoids, paying, what's, due, always, more, miserable, than, the, one, who, does, pay, it”, (479e4–6)., And, if, these, hold,, what, use, is, there, in, rhetoric?, For, someone, who, wishes, to, avoid, doing, himself, and, others, harm,, Socrates, concludes,, rhetoric, is, altogether, useless., Tied, into, logical, knots,, Polus, succumbs., All, this, is, just, too, much, for, yet, another, interlocutor, in, the, dialogue,, Callicles., The, rhetoric, of, the, Gorgias, reaches, its, most, bitter, stage., Callicles, presents, himself, as, a, no-holds-barred,, bare-knuckled,, clear-headed, advocate, of, Realpolitik,, as, we, would, now, call, it., Telling, it, like, it, is,, he, draws, a, famous, distinction, between, nature, and, convention,, and, advances, a, thesis, familiar, to, readers, of, Republic, books, I, and, II:, “But, I, believe, that, nature, itself, reveals, that, it's, a, just, thing, for, the, better, man, and, the, more, capable, man, to, have, a, greater, share, than, the, worse, man, and, the, less, capable, man., Nature, shows, that, this, is, so, in, many, places;, both, among, the, other, animals, and, in, whole, cities, and, races, of, men,, it, shows, that, this, is, what, justice, has, been, decided, to, be:, that, the, superior, rule, the, inferior, and, have, a, greater, share, than, they”, (483c8-d6)., This, is, the, “law, of, nature”, (483e3;, perhaps, the, first, occurrence, in, Western, philosophy, of, this, famous, phrase)., Conventional, talk, of, justice,, fairness,, not, taking, more, than, is, your, share,, not, pursuing, your, individual, best, interest—these, are, simply, ways, by, which, the, weak, seek, to, enslave, the, strong., The, art, of, rhetoric, is, all, about, empowering, those, who, are, strong, by, nature, to, master, the, weak, by, nature., Callicles', famous, diatribe, includes, an, indictment, of, philosophy, as, a, childish, occupation, that,, if, pursued, past, youth,, interferes, with, the, manly, pursuit, of, power,, fosters, contemptible, ignorance, of, how, the, real, political, world, works,, and, renders, its, possessor, effeminate, and, defenseless., His, example, is, none, other, than, Socrates;, philosophy, will, (he, says, prophetically), render, Socrates, helpless, should, he, be, indicted., Helplessness, in, the, face, of, the, stupidity, of, the, hoi, polloi, is, disgraceful, and, pathetic, (486a-c)., By, contrast,, what, would, it, mean, to, have, power?, Callicles, is, quite, explicit:, power, is, the, ability, to, fulfill, whatever, desire, you, have., Power, is, freedom,, freedom, is, license, (492a-c)., The, capacity, to, do, what, one, wants, is, fulfillment, in, the, sense, of, the, realization, of, pleasure., Rhetoric, is, a, means, to, that, end., The, quarrel, between, rhetoric, and, philosophy,, thus, understood,, ultimately, addresses, a, range, of, fundamental, issues., “Rhetoric”, is, taken, here, to, constitute, an, entire, world, view., Its, quarrel, with, philosophy, is, comprehensive,, and, bears, on, the, nature, of, nature;, the, existence, of, objective, moral, norms;, the, connection, (if, any), between, happiness, and, virtue;, the, nature, and, limits, of, reason;, the, value, of, reason, (understood, as, the, rational, pursuit, of, objective, purpose), in, a, human, life;, the, nature, of, the, soul, or, self;, and, the, question, as, to, whether, there, is, a, difference, between, true, and, false, pleasure,, i.e.,, whether, pleasure, is, the, good., It, is, striking, that, while, Socrates, wants, to, contrast, “rhetorical”, speech-making, with, his, own, approach, of, philosophical, dialogue,, in, practice, the, differences, blur., Socrates, too, starts, to, speak, at, length,, sounds, rhetorical, at, times,, and, ends, the, discussion, with, a, myth., Callicles, advances, a, substantive, position, (grounded, in, a, version, of, the, distinction, between, nature, and, convention), and, defends, it., These, transgressions, of, rhetorical, genres, to, one, side,, from, Socrates', standpoint, the, ultimate, philosophical, question, at, stake, concerns, how, one, should, live, one's, life, (500c)., Is, the, life, of, “politics,”, understood, as, the, pursuit, of, power, and, glory,, superior, to, the, life, of, philosophy?, Readers, of, the, dialogue, will, differ, as, to, whether, or, not, the, arguments, there, offered, decide, the, matter., The, nub, of, the, debate, is, as, current, today,, both, in, academic, and, non-academic, contexts,, as, it, was, in, Plato's, day.[26], Even, though, poetry, is, here, cast, as, a, species, of, rhetoric,, a, good, deal, of, work, would, have, to, be, done, to, show, that, the, substantive, theses, to, which, poetry, is, committed,, according, to, the, Republic,, are, the, same, as, the, substantive, theses, to, which, rhetoric, is, committed,, according, to, the, Gorgias., Is, all, of, rhetoric, bad?, Are, we, to, avoid—indeed,, can, we, avoid—rhetoric, altogether?, Even, in, the, Gorgias,, as, we, have, seen,, there, is, a, distinction, between, rhetoric, that, instills, belief,, and, rhetoric, that, instills, knowledge,, and, later, in, the, dialogue, a, form, of, noble, rhetoric, is, mentioned,, though, no, examples, of, its, practitioners, can, be, found, (503a-b)., The, Phaedrus, offers, a, more, detailed, explanation, of, this, distinction., 5., Phaedrus, Readers, of, the, Phaedrus, have, often, wondered, how, the, dialogue, hangs, together., The, first, “half”, seems, to, be, about, love,, and, the, second, about, rhetoric., A, slightly, closer, look, reveals, that, any, such, simple, characterization, is, misleading,, because, the, first, half, is, also, about, rhetoric,, in, several, different, ways., To, begin, with,, the, first, half, of, the, dialogue, contains, explicit, reflections, on, rhetoric;, for, example,, Socrates, draws, the, distinction, between, what, we, would, call, the, “form”, and, the, “content”, of, a, discourse, (235a)., Still, further,, it, consists, in, part, in, three, speeches,, at, least, the, first, of, which, (“Lysias', speech”), is, a, rhetorical, set-piece., The, other, two, are, rhetorical, as, well,, and, presented, as, efforts, to, persuade, a, young, beloved., All, three, are, justly, viewed, as, rhetorical, masterstrokes, by, Plato,, but, for, different, reasons., The, first, is, a, brilliantly, executed, parody, of, the, style, of, Lysias, (an, orator, and, speech, writer, of, significant, repute)., The, second, speech, simultaneously, preserves, aspects, of, its, fictional, frame, (the, first, was, a, paradoxical, sounding, address, by, a, “non-lover”, to, a, “beloved”),, develops, that, frame, (the, non-lover, is, transformed, into, a, concealed, lover),, and, deepens, the, themes, in, an, impressive, and, philosophically, enlightening, way., The, third, (referred, to, as, the, “palinode”, or, recantation, speech), contains, some, of, the, most, beautiful, and, powerful, images, in, all, of, Greek, literature., It, is, mostly, an, allegory, cast, in, the, form, of, a, myth,, and, tells, the, story, of, true, love, and, of, the, soul's, journeys, in, the, cosmos, human, and, divine., That, is,, the, rhetoric, of, the, great, palinode, is, markedly, “poetic.”, Especially, noteworthy, for, present, purposes, is, the, fact, that, the, theme, of, inspiration, is, repeatedly, invoked, in, the, first, half, of, the, dialogue;, poetic, inspiration, is, explicitly, discussed.[27], The, themes, of, poetry, and, rhetoric,, then,, are, intertwined, in, the, Phaedrus., It, looks, initially, as, though, both, rhetoric, and, poetry, have, gained, significant, stature,, at, least, relative, to, their, status, in, the, Ion,, Republic,, and, Gorgias., I, will, begin, by, focusing, primarily, on, rhetoric,, and, then, turn, to, the, question, of, poetry,, even, though, the, two, themes, are, closely, connected, in, this, dialogue., 5.1, Rhetoric, in, the, Phaedrus, The, second, “half”, of, the, dialogue, does, not, discuss, the, nature, of, love, thematically,, at, any, length,, but, it, does, in, effect, propose, that, discourse, prompted, by, the, love, of, wisdom—philosophy—is, true, rhetoric., As, the, conversation, between, one, “lover, of, speeches”, (228c1–2), and, another, evolves,, the, three, rhetorical, speeches, of, the, first, part, of, the, dialogue, are, examined, from, the, perspective, of, their, rhetorical, artlessness, or, artfulness., Poetry, is, once, again, cast, as, a, kind, of, speech, making, (258b3), and,, very, importantly,, Socrates, declares, that, “It's, not, speaking, or, writing, well, that's, shameful;, what's, really, shameful, is, to, engage, in, either, of, them, shamefully, or, badly”, (258d4–5).[28], The, proffering, of, discourses, is, not, in, and, of, itself, shameful;, what, then, constitutes, honorable, speech, making?, The, answer, to, this, crucial, question, constitutes, one, of, the, most, famous, contributions, to, the, topic., In, essence,, Socrates, argues, that, someone, who, is, going, to, speak, well, and, nobly, must, know, the, truth, about, the, subject, he, is, going, to, discuss., The, sort, of, theory, Polus, and, Callicles, maintained, in, the, Gorgias, is, false, (see, Phaedrus, 259e4–260a4)., In, order, to, make, good, on, this, sweeping, claim,, Socrates, argues, that, rhetoric, is, an, “art”, (techne),, and, not, just, artless, practice, (the, equivalent, of, the, “empeiria”, for, which, rhetoric, was, condemned, in, the, Gorgias)., How, to, show, that, it, is, an, art, after, all?, Quite, a, number, of, claimants, to, rhetoric, are, named, and, reviewed,, and, readers, who, have, an, interest, in, the, history, of, Greek, rhetoric, rightly, find, these, passages, invaluable., We, are, told, here, that, the, extant, manuals, of, rhetoric, offer, the, “preliminaries”, to, the, true, art, of, rhetoric,, not, the, thing, itself, (269b7–8)., Many, rhetoricians, have, artfully, and, effectively, misled, their, audiences,, and, Socrates, argues—somewhat, implausibly, perhaps—that, in, order, to, mislead, one, cannot, oneself, be, misled.[29], An, artful, speech, exhibits, its, artfulness, in, its, structure,, one, that—since, in, the, best, case, it, embodies, the, truth—retraces, or, mirrors, the, natural, divisions, of, the, subject, matter, itself., It, will, not, only, be, coherent,, but, structured, in, a, way, that, mirrors, the, way, the, subject, itself, is, naturally, organized., In, one, of, Socrates', most, famous, images,, a, good, composition, should, exhibit, the, organic, unity, of, a, living, creature,, “with, a, body, of, its, own;, it, must, be, neither, without, head, nor, without, legs;, and, it, must, have, a, middle, and, extremities, that, are, fitting, both, to, one, another, and, to, the, whole, work”, (264c1–5)., This, will, not, be, truly, accomplished, if, it, only, looks, that, way;, to, be, that, way,, a, discourse's, unity, should, reflect, the, unity, of, its, subject., At, this, point, we, might, want, to, ask, about, the, audience;, after, all,, the, rhetorician, is, trying, to, persuade, someone, of, something., Might, not, the, speaker, know, the, truth, of, the, matter,, and, know, how, to, embody, it, artfully, in, a, composition,, but, fail, to, persuade, anyone, of, it?, Would, not, a, failure, to, persuade, indicate, that, the, speaker, lacks, the, complete, art, of, rhetoric?, Socrates, in, effect, responds, to, this, question, by, postulating, that, the, successful, speaker, must, also, know, the, nature, of, the, human, soul,, else, his, skill, is, just, “empeiria”, (the, term, from, the, Gorgias, again), rather, than, “techne”, (270b6)., Just, as, an, expert, physician, must, understand, both, the, human, body, and, the, body, of, medical, knowledge—these, being, inseparable—so, too, the, expert, speaker, must, understand, both, the, human, soul, and, what, is, known, about, the, soul., The, reader, will, immediately, recall, that, the, great, speech, (the, palinode), in, the, first, half, of, the, Phaedrus, was, about, the, soul, in, its, cosmic, context—the, soul's, nature,, its, journeys, divine, and, human,, its, longings,, the, objects, of, its, longings,, its, failures, and, their, consequences,, were, all, part, of, the, same, story., Thus, it, is, not, surprising, that, when, defining, the, art, of, rhetoric, Socrates, suggests, that, we, cannot, “reach, a, serious, understanding, of, the, nature, of, the, soul, without, understanding, the, nature, of, the, world, as, a, whole”, (270c1–2)., The, consequence, of, this, approach, to, rhetoric, has, now, become, clear:, to, possess, that, art,, one, must, be, a, philosopher., True, rhetoric, is, philosophical, discourse., But, what, happened, to, the, question, about, the, audience?, “The, soul”, is, not, the, addressee, of, a, rhetorical, discourse., Socrates, responds, that, the, artful, rhetorician, must, also, know, what, the, types, of, soul, are,, what, sorts, of, speeches, “work”, on, each, type,, and, be, able, to, identify, which, type, is, being, addressed, on, the, given, occasion., This, last, demand, is, a, matter, of, practice, and, of, the, ability, to, size, up, the, audience, on, the, spot,, as, it, were., The, requirements, of, the, true, art, of, rhetoric,, which, Socrates, also, calls, the, “art, of, dialectic”, (276e5–6),, are, very, high, indeed., (The, reader, will, find, them, summarized, at, 277b5-c6)., If, the, audience, is, philosophical,, or, includes, philosophers,, how, would, the, true,, artful,, philosophical, dialectician, address, it?, This, question, is, not, faced, head-on, in, the, Phaedrus,, but, we, are, given, a, number, of, clues., They, are, introduced, by, means, of, a, myth—by, a, kind, of, “poetry,”, if, you, will—and, they, help, us, understand, the, sort, of, discourse, a, philosopher, will, on, the, whole, wish, to, avoid,, namely, that, which, is, written., According, to, reflections, inaugurated, by, the, Theuth, and, Thamus, myth,, the, written, word, is, not, the, most, suitable, vehicle, for, communicating, truth,, because, it, cannot, answer, questions, put, to, it;, it, simply, repeats, itself, when, queried;, it, tends, to, substitute, the, authority, of, the, author, for, the, reader's, open, minded, inquiry, into, the, truth;, and, it, circulates, everywhere, indiscriminately,, falling, into, the, hands, of, people, who, cannot, understand, it., Very, importantly,, it, interferes, with, true, “recollection”, (anamnesis,, 249c2),, that, process, described, at, length, and, (for, the, most, part), poetically, in, the, dialogue's, “palinode,”, by, which, the, knowledge, latent, in, the, soul, is, brought, out, through, question, and, answer, (274d-275b)., Writing, is, a, clumsy, medium,, and, thus, would, not, match, the, potential, effectiveness, of, philosophical, give, and, take,, the, “Socratic, dialogue”, which, best, leads, the, philosophical, mind, to, truth., This, desirable, rhetoric, is, “a, discourse, that, is, written, down,, with, knowledge,, in, the, soul, of, the, listener;, it, can, defend, itself,, and, it, knows, for, whom, it, should, speak, and, for, whom, it, should, remain, silent”, (276a5–7)., Dialectical, speech, is, accompanied, by, knowledge,, can, defend, itself, when, questioned,, and, is, productive, of, knowledge, in, its, audience, (276e4–277a4)., Of, course,, all, this, raises, the, question, as, to, the, status, of, Plato's, dialogues,, since, they, are, themselves, writings;, we, will, return, to, it, briefly, below., Rhetoric, is, the, art, of, “directing, the, soul, by, means, of, speech”, (261a8)., Popular, rhetoric, is, not, an, art,, but, a, knack, for, persuasion., Artful, rhetoric, requires, philosophy;, but, does, philosophy, require, rhetoric?, Why, must, philosophical, discourse—say,, as, exemplified, in, “Socratic, dialogue”—have, anything, to, do, with, rhetoric?, The, Phaedrus, points, to, the, interesting, thought, that, all, discourse, is, rhetorical,, even, when, the, speaker, is, simply, trying, to, communicate, the, truth—indeed,, true, rhetoric, is, the, art, of, communicating, the, truth, (notice, the, broad, sweep, of, the, discussion, of, discourse, at, 277e5–278b4)., Rhetoric, is, present, wherever, and, whenever, people, speak, (261d10-e4, and, context)., Even, when, one, is, not, sure, what, the, truth, is,, and, even, when, one, is, thinking, through, something, by, oneself—carrying, on, an, inner, dialogue,, as, it, were—discourse, and, persuasion, are, present.[30], Of, course,, a, philosopher, will, question, assertions, that, he, or, she, ought, to, persuaded, of, X;, but, that, questioning, too,, the, Phaedrus, suggests,, is, part, of, a, process, aimed, at, warranted, persuasion,, and, inevitably, involves, a, mix, of, the, “persuadability”, of, the, philosopher, on, the, one, hand,, and, the, truth, (or, falsity), of, the, claims, on, the, other., The, bottom, line, is, that, there, is, no, escaping, from, persuasion,, and, so, none, from, rhetoric—including, of, course, from, the, very, problem, of, distinguishing, between, warranted, and, unwarranted, persuasion., Self-deception, is, an, ever-present, possibility, (as, Socrates, implies, here,, and, notes, at, Cratylus, 428d)., That, is, a, problem, about, which, the, philosopher, above, all, worries, about., It, is, always, a, question, of, “directing, the, soul, by, means, of, speech,”, even, where, it's, a, matter, of, the, soul, directing, or, leading, itself, (or, to, use, a, phrase, from, earlier, in, the, dialogue,, moving, itself, (245e)).[31], The, Gorgias', notion, that, the, struggle, between, (popular), rhetoric, and, philosophy—or, as, we, might, say,, unphilosophical, and, philosophical, rhetoric—is, one, between, comprehensive, outlooks, is, clear, from, the, Phaedrus, as, well., The, “great, speech”, or, palinode, of, the, dialogue, illustrates, the, character, and, range, of, views, upon, which, the, project, of, philosophical, rhetoric, (of, philosophy,, in, short), is, built., The, speech, is, quite, explicitly, a, retraction, of, an, outlook, that, does, not, espouse, these, views;, ordinary, rhetoric, moves, in, a, very, different, moral,, metaphysical,, psychological,, and, epistemic, world., It, is, an, interesting, fact, that, Plato, deploys, certain, elements, of, poetry, (such, as, myth,, allegory,, simile,, image), in, drawing, the, contrast, between, these, outlooks., 5.2, Rhapsodes,, Inspiration,, and, Poetry, in, the, Phaedrus, That, poetry, is, itself, a, kind, of, persuasive, discourse, or, rhetoric, has, already, been, mentioned., It, comes, as, no, surprise, to, read, that, Socrates, indicts, rhapsodes, on, the, grounds, that, their, speeches, proceed, “without, questioning, and, explanation”, and, “are, given, only, in, order, to, produce, conviction”, (277e8–9)., This, echoes, the, Ion's, charge, that, the, rhapsodes, do, not, know, what, they, are, talking, about., But, what, about, the, rationale, that, the, poets, and, rhapsodes, are, inspired?, Inspiration, comes, up, numerous, times, in, the, Phaedrus., It, and, the, related, notions, of, Bacchic, frenzy,, madness,, and, possession, are, invoked, repeatedly, almost, from, the, start, of, the, dialogue, (228b),, in, connection, with, Phaedrus', allegedly, inspiring, recitation, of, Lysias', text, (234d1–6),, and, as, inspiring, Socrates's, two, speeches, (237a7–b1,, 262d2–6,, 263d1–3)., These, references, are, uniformly, playful,, even, at, times, joking., More, serious, is, the, distinction, between, ordinary, madness, and, divine, madness,, and, the, defense, of, the, superiority, of, divine, madness,, which, Socrates', second, speech, sets, out, to, defend., In, particular,, he, sets, out, to, show, that, the, madness, of, love, or, eros, “is, given, us, by, the, gods, to, ensure, our, greatest, good, fortune”, (245b7-c1)., The, case, is, first, made, by, noting, that, three, species, of, madness, are, already, accepted:, that, of, the, prophets,, that, of, certain, purifying, or, cathartic, religious, rites,, and, the, third, that, inspiration, granted, by, the, Muses, that, moves, its, possessor, to, poetry, (244b-245a)., As, noted,, it, begins, to, look, as, though, a, certain, kind, of, poetry, (the, inspired), is, being, rehabilitated., And, yet, when, Socrates, comes, to, classify, kinds, of, lives, a, bit, further, on,, the, poets, (along, with, those, who, have, anything, to, do, with, mimesis), rank, a, low, sixth, out, of, nine,, after, the, likes, of, household, managers,, financiers,, doctors,, and, prophets, (248e1–2)!, The, poet, is, just, ahead, of, the, manual, laborer,, sophist,, and, tyrant., The, philosopher, comes, in, first,, as, the, criterion, for, the, ranking, concerns, the, level, of, knowledge, of, truth, about, the, Ideas, or, Forms, of, which, the, soul, in, question, is, capable., This, hierarchy, of, lives, could, scarcely, be, said, to, rehabilitate, the, poet., The, Phaedrus, quietly, sustains, the, critique, of, poetry,, as, well, as, (much, less, quietly), of, rhetoric., 6., Plato's, Dialogues, as, Rhetoric, and, Poetry, Plato's, critique, of, writing, on, the, grounds, that, it, is, a, poor, form, of, rhetoric, is, itself, written., Of, course,, his, Socrates, does, not, know, that, he, is, “speaking”, in, the, context, of, a, written, dialogue;, but, the, reader, immediately, discerns, the, puzzle., Does, the, critique, apply, to, the, dialogues, themselves?, If, not,, do, the, dialogues, escape, the, critique, altogether,, or, meet, it, in, part, (being, inferior, to, “live”, dialogue,, but, not, liable, to, the, full, force, of, Socrates', criticisms)?, Scholars, dispute, the, answers, to, these, well-known, questions.[32], There, is, general, agreement, that, Plato, perfected—perhaps, even, invented—a, new, form, of, discourse., The, Platonic, dialogue, is, a, innovative, type, of, rhetoric,, and, it, is, hard, to, believe, that, it, does, not, at, all, reflect—whether, successfully, or, not, is, another, matter—Plato's, response, to, the, criticisms, of, writing, which, he, puts, into, the, mouth, of, his, Socrates., Plato's, remarkable, philosophical, rhetoric, incorporates, elements, of, poetry., Most, obviously,, his, dialogues, are, dramas, with, several, formal, features, in, common, with, much, tragedy, and, comedy, (for, example,, the, use, of, authorial, irony,, the, importance, of, plot,, setting,, the, role, of, individual, character, and, the, interplay, between, dramatis, personae)., No, character, called, “Plato”, ever, says, a, word, in, his, texts., His, works, also, narrate, a, number, of, myths,, and, sparkle, with, imagery,, simile,, allegory,, and, snatches, of, meter, and, rhyme., Indeed,, as, he, sets, out, the, city, in, speech, in, the, Republic,, Socrates, calls, himself, a, myth, teller, (376d9–10,, 501e4–5)., In, a, number, of, ways,, the, dialogues, may, be, said, to, be, works, of, fiction;, none, of, them, took, place, exactly, as, presented, by, Plato,, several, could, not, have, taken, place,, some, contain, characters, who, never, existed., These, are, imaginary, conversations,, imitations, of, certain, kinds, of, philosophical, conversations., The, reader, is, undoubtedly, invited, to, see, him, or, herself, reflected, in, various, characters,, and, to, that, extent, identify, with, them,, even, while, also, focusing, on, the, arguments,, exchanges,, and, speeches., Readers, of, Plato, often, refer, to, the, “literary”, dimension, of, his, writings,, or, simply, refer, to, them, as, a, species, of, philosophical, literature., Exactly, what, to, make, of, his, appropriation, of, elements, of, poetry, is, once, again, a, matter, of, long, discussion, and, controversy.[33], Suffice, it, to, say, that, Plato's, last, word, on, the, critique, of, poetry, and, rhetoric, is, not, spoken, in, his, dialogues,, but, is, embodied, in, the, dialogue, form, of, writing, he, brought, to, perfection., Bibliography, Adams,, J., C.,, 1996,, “The, Rhetorical, Significance, of, the, Conversion, of, the, Lover's, Soul, in, Plato's, Phaedrus,”, Rhetoric,
