really, attacks.”, Like, Finlay,, Kingsnorth, has, concluded, that, in, order, to, challenge, the, status, quo, he, must, first, disentangle, himself, from, it,, as, far, as, is, possible,, and, so, in, 2014, the, Booker-shortlisted, author, and, his, wife, moved, from, “urban, England, to, rural, Ireland”., Books, Book, review:, Irresistible:, Why, we, can’t, stop, checking,, scrolling,,

“it’s, strange,, when, you, think, about, it,, that, normal, intelligent, people, can, believe, something, as, unreasonable, as, the, Christian, religion…, even, if, you, don’t, share, their, faith,, you, take, them, seriously”., This, needles, Carrère, into, writing, this, book., He, is, successful, as, a, novelist, and, screenwriter,, but, has, a, secret,, in, that, he, used, to, believe., So, he, writes, a, kind, of, extended, treatment,, an, unmakeable, film,, about, the, origins, of, the, early, Church., It, is, a, book, where, the, author, tells, you, what, he, is, thinking, and, then,

worked, in, would, soon, be, covered, with, a, new, housing, development., My, sense, of, sadness, at, hearing, this, news, was, out, of, all, proportion, to, my, very, tenuous, connection, to, the, place, –, I, had,, after, all,, only, been, there, for, a, few, sunny,, dusty,, sweaty,, hand-sore, days, –, so, I, can, only, begin, to, imagine, the, immense, weight, of, sorrow, that, must, lie, on, the, shoulders, of, Jim, Carruth,, Glasgow’s, poet, laureate,, who, grew, up, on, a, farm, near, Kilbarchan, in, Renfrewshire,, surrounded, by, other, farms, and, steeped, in, the, age-old, traditions, of, farming,, only, to, see, much, of, it, vanish, in, the, space, of, a, few, short, decades., This, book,, some, 16, years, in, the, making,, is, Carruth’s, deeply, felt, tribute, to, this, rapidly, disappearing, way, of, life,, to, the, people, and, places, and, what, they, once, meant,, but, it, is, by, no, means, an, idealised, portrait, –, he, forces, us, to, confront, all, the, harsh, realities, of, farming, life,, and, to, mourn, its, passing, in, spite, of, them., New-born, kittens, aren’t, drowned, in, “Drowning, Kittens”, –, the, poet’s, father, explains, that,

fidelity, and, infidelity,, about, the, tension, created, by, the, awareness, of, what, one, owes, to, oneself, and, what, one, owes, to, others., It, is, intelligent,, comic,, sad, and, at, times, disturbing., Books, Colin, Dexter,, Inspector, Morse, author,, dies, aged, 86, Inspector, Morse, author, Colin, Dexter, has, died, aged, 86., Books, 1, Festival, review:, Aye, Write!, Everyone, loves, Joan, Eardley, –, everyone, who, knows, about, her, art,, anyway,, which, still, seems, to, exclude, many, English, art, lovers, (odd,, because, Eardley, was, English-born, and, reared),, but, must, surely, include, practically, everyone, who, has, seen, the, hugely, popular, exhibition, of, her, work, currently, at, Modern, Two, in, Edinburgh, or, the, packed, audience, who, heard, Anne, Galastro’s, excellent, talk, at, Aye, Write!, on, Saturday, morning., Books, Ian, Rankin, reveals, line-up, for, 'RebusFest', event, Serving, and, former, police, officers, are, to, be, quizzed, by,
