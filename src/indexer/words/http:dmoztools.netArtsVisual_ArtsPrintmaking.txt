applying, ink, to, (usually), paper,, typically, with, the, goal, of, producing, original, images, in, multiples., The, idea, of, an, "original, print", may,, at, first,, seem, contradictory,, but, it, means, that, the, resulting, image, itself, did, not, exist, prior, to, the, process, of, printing, it., There, may, have, been, sketches, or, preliminary, studies, done, beforehand,, but, as, far, as, the, printmaker, is, concerned,, they, are, not, the, "original", works., The, process, of, creating, the, plate, (or, whatever),, applying, ink, and, pulling, a, print, can, influence, the, outcome., Ideally,, a, printmaker, will, work, with, the, medium,, rather, than, attempt, to, force, it, to, some, pre-determined, result., "Reproductions",, on, the, other, hand,, are, prints, which, attempt, to, resemble,, as, closely, as, possible,, an, image, which, is, already, a, finished, drawing, or, painting, in, its, own, right., The, original, work, is, photographed, or, scanned,, and, then, either, color, separation, plates, are, made, or, the, file, is, printed, on, an, inkjet, printer., Some, reproductions, may, be, produced, in, numbered, limited, editions, and, signed, by, the, artist,, but, they, are, not,, in, the, strict, sense,, original, prints., It, is,, however, one, means, by, which, a, popular, image, may, be, shared, by, many, people,, and, usually, at, a, lower, cost, than, a, one-of-a-kind, work,, or, even, an, original, print., Some, prints, may, be, produced, on, plastic, film, or, fabrics,, or, other, materials, than, paper., Some, may, use, pigmented, materials, other, than, traditional, printing, ink., Some, prints, may, not, be, intended, to, be, produced, in, multiples., The, artist, may, wish, merely, to, use, a, press, and, printmaking, techniques, to, achieve, a, particular, texture, or, visual, effect, that, is, unique, to, the, process., Each, subsequent, impression, may, involve, selective, applications, of, ink,, or, be, the, result, of, modifications, to, the, plate,, and, so, on., A, printmaker, may, not, be, the, person, who, actually, does, the, printing., Many, original, prints, are, the, result, of, a, close, collaboration, between, the, artist, who, provides, the, image, for, a, print,, and, a, master, printer, who, prints, the, edition., An, example, of, this, type, of, collaboration, may, be, where, an, artist, applies, an, image, directly, on, a, prepared, plate, or, stone,, and, selects, colors;, then, a, printer, will, etch, the, plate, or, stone,, mix, the, inks, and, pull, some, proofs, for, review, by, the, artist., The, artist, may, want, to, modify, the, plate, or, stone,, after, which, the, printer, will, pull, some, more, proofs., Ultimately,, a, final, look, is, decided, upon,, and, the, master, printer, prints, the, pre-determined, number, of, prints., The, degree, to, which, the, artist, "gets, their, hands, dirty", could, depend, on, their, familiarity, with, the, technical, aspects., Subcategories, 9, Intaglio, and, Allied, Techniques, 8, Lithograph­y, 6, Monotype, 6, Relief, Techniques, 10, Serigraphy, Silkscreen, 4, Ateliers, 20, Printmaker­s, 65, Digital, Printing,
