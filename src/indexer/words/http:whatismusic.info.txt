[What, is, Music?, Solving, a, Scientific, Mystery, Blog, Articles, Author, The, Big, Question, The, big, question, is:, "What, is, Music?"., It, seems, an, easy, question, to, answer,, because, we, are, all, so, familiar, with, music., But, being, familiar, with, something, is, not, the, same, thing, as, knowing, what, it, is., When, I, ask, myself, this, question, about, music,, I, ask, it, as, a, scientific, question., So, I, want, an, answer, which, relates, music, to, our, scientific, understanding, of, the, world., And, I, want, an, answer, that, makes, predictions, about, music, (and, for, bonus, points,, it, should, make, predictions, about, other, things, besides, music)., I, don't, know, for, sure, that, I've, got, any, closer, to, answering, this, question, yet., Over, the, years, (and, the, decades),, I've, had, some, promising, ideas., Some, of, those, ideas, still, seem, promising,, and, others, now, seem, less, promising., I'm, fairly, sure, that, no, one, else, has, yet, answered, the, question., The, production, of, new, music, that, people, want, to, listen, to, continues, to, be, more, of, an, art, than, a, science, –, which, means, that, even, the, people, making, music, don't, really, know, what, it, is., So,, let, me, introduce, myself., My, name, is, Philip, Dorrell,, and, I, am, a, Music, Science, addict., Tweet, Current, Hypotheses,, Assumptions, and, Ideas, about, Music, Music, Induces, an, Altered, State, of, Mind., The, primary, effect, of, music,, and, the, primary, biological, function, of, music,, is, to, induce, an, altered, state, of, mind., The, Musical, State, of, Mind, Alters, Our, Responses, to, Daydreams,, Especially, Our, Emotional, Responses., Listening, to, music, creates, a, desire, to, partially, disconnect, from, immediate, reality, (the, "here, and, now"),, and, think, about, things, that, are, not, in, our, immediate, reality,, ie, to, daydream., When, we, daydream,, while, listening, to, music,, we, more, fully, experience, the, emotions, in, our, daydreams., This, effect, is, most, noticeable, when, we, listen, to, the, music, that, we, most, like., Supporting, Evidence:, Many, Daydreaming, "Addicts", are, Co-Addicted, to, Music., So-called, "Maladaptive, Daydreamers", are, a, group, of, people, who, are, self-reportedly, addicted, to, daydreaming., For, many, of, the, these, MD-ers,, their, addiction, is, either, triggered, by, music,, or,, they, are, addicted, to, the, combination, of, listening, to, music, and, daydreaming., The, Content, of, Music, Has, No, Intrinsic, Meaning., It, is, Only, a, Signal., Music, induces, an, altered, state, of, mind,, and, the, content, of, music, is, the, signal, which, induces, that, state, of, mind., The, content, of, music, has, no, other, purpose,, and, no, other, meaning., Music, is, Very, Similar, to, Language,, and, This, Needs, To, Be, Explained,, But, ..., The, relationship, between, Music, and, Language, extends, across, many, individual, aspects, of, both, things,, and, it, is, implausible, that, the, two, phenomena, are, not, related, somehow., However,, we, should, not, too, eagerly, jump, to, the, conclusion, that, Music, and, Language, necessarily, share, any, particular, purpose, or, function,, such, as, "communication"., The, Complexity, of, the, Musical, "Signal", Implies, an, Evolutionary, Pre-Cursor., If, the, content, of, music, is, a, signal,, and, the, effect, of, the, signal, is, the, only, thing, that, matters,, biologically,, then, the, sheer, complexity, of, musical, content, seems, difficult, to, explain., I, propose, that, the, complexity, of, the, musical, "signal", can, be, explained, by, the, hypothesis, that, the, human, response, to, music, evolved, from, something, else., Given, the, observed, similarity, of, music, and, language,, that, "something, else", was, most, likely, some, component, of, the, human, response, to, language., The, Evolutionary, Pre-Cursor:, A, Response, to, "Language-Like", Sounds., Given, the, similarity, of, music, to, language,, and, the, similarity, of, individual, aspects, of, music, to, corresponding, aspects, of, language,, the, response, to, music, appears, to, be, an, altered, version, of, an, instinctive, human, response, to, simultaneous, occurrence, of, different, aspects, of, "language-like", sounds., The, Evolutionary, Pre-Cursor:, Initial, Language, Acquisition., One, time, in, life, when, a, person, would, most, benefit, from, a, pre-programmed, instinctive, response, to, "language-like", sounds, is, at, the, very, beginning, of, language, acquisition., When, it's, just, starting, to, learn, language,, an, infant, needs, to, somehow, "know",, or, perhaps, to, "discover",, that, there, actually, is, this, thing, which, is, language,, which, needs, to, be, learned, and, processed, and, understood, as, a, thing, in, itself, separate, from, all, the, other, non-language, stimuli, in, the, world., Also,, eventually,, the, infant, needs, to, learn, that, the, contents, of, language, can, refer, to, things, not, in, immediate, reality., The, Evolutionary, Pre-Cursor:, Language-Like, Sounds, Induce, an, Altered, State, of, Mind., We, can, account, for, the, mind-altering, effect, of, music,, and, the, evolution, of, music, from, a, component, of, the, language, acquisition, instinct,, if, we, can, show, that, language, acquisition, involves, a, similar, altered, state, of, mind., For, example,, the, requirement, to, process, and, understand, language, as, something, which, is, both, important,, and, somewhat, distinct, from, all, other, aspects, of, reality,, can, be, aided, if, the, occurrence, of, "language-like", sounds, triggers, an, altered, state, of, mind, where, there, is, a, strong, "connection", to, those, sounds, and, at, the, same, time, a, partial, disconnection, from, other, aspects, of, reality., And, the, requirement, to, learn, that, language, can, refer, to, things, beyond, immediate, reality, can, be, aided, by, a, tendency, to, think, about, things, beyond, immediate, reality., (Whether, or, not, any, of, this, actually, happens, during, the, early, stages, of, language, acquisition, is, something, that, hopefully, can, be, investigated, scientifically, by, scientists, studying, infant, language, acquisition.), Compared, to, Language,, Music, is, More, Constrained,, and, the, Production, of, Music, is, Economically, and, Socially, More, Competitive., Human, languages, have, idenfiable, syntax,, and, every, fluent, language, speaker, learns, to, freely, generate, and, "perform", original, and, valid, utterances, according, to, that, syntax., Whereas,, most, people, do, not, compose, (ie, "generate"), music,, or, if, they, do,, the, results, of, their, efforts, are, unlikely, to, be, of, interest, to, other, people., Musical, performance, is, also, very, difficult,, and, typically, years, of, conscious, practice, are, required, to, achieve, a, satisfactory, result., The, intrinsic, difficulties, of, musical, composition, and, performance, prevent, music, from, being, used, as, an, effective, means, of, communication,, ie,, music, is, not, a, language., In, Music,, Certain, Things, Don't, Happen., Spoken, languages, have, various, forms, of, identifiable, "melody",, but, these, melodies, do, not, live, precisely, on, scales,, like, those, in, music., In, music,, pitch, values, between, the, notes, in, the, scale, do, not, occur., Similarly,, the, distribution, of, beat, frequencies, in, speech, "rhythm", will, be, continuous,, whereas, in, music, the, distribution, will, be, discrete,, corresponding, to, the, bar, tempo,, the, note, tempo, and, a, finite, number, of, tempos, related, to, those, two, tempos, by, simple, integer, multiples., For, example,, in, the, case, of, a, 4/4, time, signature, with, 16th, notes,, the, tempos, correspond, to, period, lengths, of, one, bar,, half, bar,, one, note,, half, note, and, quarter, note,, and, other, tempos, won't, appear, in, the, beat, tempo, spectrum., Music, Perception, Requires, Patterns, of, Inactivity, In, Cortical, Maps, that, Respond, to, "Language-Like", Sounds., Normal, speech, will, generate, activity, in, cortical, maps, in, the, listener's, brain,, and, some, of, these, maps, are, substantially, specialised, for, perceiving, speech., The, similarity, of, music, to, language, means, that, music, will, cause, activity, in, the, same, cortical, maps,, however, the, things, that, "don't, happen", in, music, will, result, in, constant, regions, of, inactivity, within, those, cortical, maps., This, additional, requirement, for, patterns, of, inactivity, is, one, of, the, things, that, makes, music, more, constrained, than, language., The, Constrainedness, of, Music, Disables, Music, as, a, Language, Music, has, evolved, from, an, aspect, of, the, human, response, to, language,, but, it, serves, a, purpose, distinct, from, that, of, language., Because, music, is, so, much, like, language,, there, is, a, risk, that, the, human, infant, will, confuse, music, with, language., To, prevent, this,, it, is, necessary, for, music, to, be, linguistically, disabled., The, additional, constraints, which, apply, to, music, help, to, disable, music, as, a, language,, and, this, disablement, leaves, the, infant, mind, free, to, fully, concentrate, its, language-learning, efforts, on, actual, language., The, Constrainedness, of, Music, Limits, Its, Mind-Altering, Effects, Music, induces, an, altered, state, of, mind., Presumably, the, altered, state, of, mind, is, beneficial., But, at, the, same, time,, presumably, it, is, not, beneficial, to, be, in, that, altered, state, of, mind, all, the, time, (otherwise, it, would, just, be, the, default, state, of, mind,, and, there, would, be, no, need, to, have, a, special, signal, for, entering, that, state)., The, "difficulty", of, composing, and, performing, music, effectively, limits, how, much, time, any, one, listener, can, spend, listening, to, music, and, being, in, the, altered, state., (Of, course, modern, technology, overcomes, some, of, this, difficulty,, and,, as, a, result,, it, may, be, that, these, days, we, all, spend, "too, much", time, listening, to, too, much, music,, compared, to, what, is, biologically, optimal.), To, learn, more:, These, theories, and, hypotheses, are, all, under, active, development., The, best, place, to, read, about, my, latest, ideas, and, hypotheses, is, at, my, What, is, Music, blog., Tweet, More, Miscellaneous, Ideas, And, Hypotheses, about, Music, The, study, of, music, is, part, of, biology., Music, exists, because, people, create, it,, perform, it, and, listen, to, it., People, are, living, organisms,, and, biology, is, the, study, of, living, organisms., A, complete, scientific, theory, of, music, should, pass, the, "Billion-Dollar, Yacht, Test"., A, scientific, theory, of, anything, should, make, predictions,, and, to, be, convincing, these, predictions, should, be, quite, specific, and, detailed,, and, not, accidentally, correct, for, some, reason, unrelated, to, the, theory, in, question., For, a, candidate, theory, of, music,, this, is, most, easily, achieved, by, using, the, theory, to, generate, unlimited, quantities, of, commercially, successful, music, (and,, optionally,, using, the, associated, profits, to, purchase, an, expensive, yacht)., The, human, brain, is, an, information, processing, system., An, information, processing, system, has, four, basic, components:, input,, output,, calculation, and, storage., Applying, this, framework, to, the, analysis, of, music,, music, appears, to, represent, the, input., What, kind, of, information, is, the, output,, and, what, does, it, mean?, How, is, it, calculated?, (If,, as, outlined, above,, music, is, a, somewhat, arbitrary, signal,, then, we, cannot, determine, that, the, content, of, music, has, any, intrinsic, meaning,, beyond, the, fact, that, it, constitutes, a, signal.), Dance, is, an, aspect, of, music., We, usually, think, of, dance, as, something, which, accompanies, music,, but, here, I, propose, something, stronger:, dance, actually, is, music., Music, perception, is, analogous, in, some, way, to, speech, perception,, but, speech, perception, is, not, just, the, perception, of, sounds:, it, also, includes, visual, perception, of, the, speaker's, movements, such, as, facial, expressions,, body, language, and, hand, gestures., Dance,, and, especially, our, response, to, watching, other, people, dance,, can, be, identified, as, being, analogous, in, the, same, way, to, this, visual, component, of, speech, perception., There, are, at, least, five, and, possibly, six, symmetries, of, music., These, are:, Pitch, translation, invariance, Time, translation, invariance, Time, scaling, invariance, Amplitude, scaling, invariance, Octave, translation, invariance, Pitch, reflection, invariance, Each, of, these, symmetries, represents, an, invariance, of, some, aspect, of, the, perceived, quality, of, music, under, the, corresponding, set, of, transformations., For, each, symmetry, we, can, ask, "Why?", and, "How?"., The, first, four, symmetries, are, functional, symmetries, in, that, they, satisfy, a, requirement, for, invariance, of, perception,, i.e., for, each, symmetry, in, this, group, our, perception, of, speech, should, be, invariant, under, the, set, of, transformations, that, define, the, symmetry., For, example,, perception, of, speech, melody, is, invariant, under, pitch, translation, so, that, people, with, different, frequency, ranges, can, speak, the, same, speech, melodies,, and, have, those, melodies, perceived, as, being, the, same., The, last, two, are, implementation, symmetries, which, play, an, internal, role, in, the, perception, of, music., (For, example, see, the, next, item, on, octave, translation, invariance.), For, some, of, the, symmetries, the, "how", question, has, an, answer, less, trivial, than, one, might, initially, assume., In, particular, it, is, not, that, straightforward, to, explain, how, the, human, brain, achieves, pitch-translation, invariance, and, time-scaling, invariance., Octave, translation, invariance, is, an, implementation, symmetry, which, facilitates, the, efficient, subtraction, of, pitch, values., Octave, translation, invariance, is, the, result, of, splitting, the, representation, of, pitch, into, a, precise, value, modulo, octaves, and, an, imprecise, absolute, value., This, split, enables, the, more, efficient, representation, and, processing, of, pitch, values,, particularly, when, one, pitch, value, must, be, "subtracted", from, another, to, calculate, interval, size., Our, perception, of, relative, pitch, must, be, calibrated, somehow., The, requirement, to, calibrate, relative, pitch, perception, explains, the, importance, of, consonant, intervals, in, music, perception., Consonant, intervals, correspond, to, the, intervals, between, the, harmonic, components, of, voiced, sounds, in, human, speech,, and, they, provide, a, natural, standard, for, calibrating, the, comparison, of, pitch, intervals, between, different, pairs, of, pitch, values., Our, accurate, ability, to, calculate, and, compare, pitch, intervals, enables, the, pitch, translation, invariant, perception, of, speech, melody., The, question,, "What, is, Music?",, and, its, many, answers, ..., Historical, Interest, Only:, The, Superstimulus, Hypothesis, My, initial, "big, idea", about, music, was, the, Superstimulus, Hypothesis,, that, music, is, a, super-stimulus, for, some, aspect, of, speech, perception., This, theory, drove, much, of, my, original, investigation,, and, resulted, in, the, development, of, many, specific, hypotheses, about, specific, aspects, of, music., I, wrote, a, whole, book, about, it., Yet,, I, no, longer, believe, that, hypothesis, to, be, the, correct, answer,, and, it, is, effectively, replaced, by, the, hypothesis, outlined, above,, that, music, is, a, signal, which, induces, an, altered, state, of, mind,, where,, possibly, among, other, things,, the, emotional, response, to, daydreams, is, intensified., But,, in, the, course, of, attempting, to, fully, develop, the, Superstimulus, Hypothesis,, I, discovered, and, developed, many, associated, ideas, and, hypotheses, about, music,, some, of, which, I, consider, remain, relevant., (Paperback,, 324, pages,, 6", by, 9"), View, of, back, cover, (Note:, this, historical, section, has, not, been, edited, –, it, contains, the, original, blurb, for, my, book, about, the, super-stimulus, theory.), What, is, Music?:, Solving, a, Scientific, Mystery, is, a, book, by, Philip, Dorrell, which, explains, a, new, scientific, theory, about, music:, the, super-stimulus, theory., The, main, idea, of, the, theory, is, that, music, is, a, super-stimulus, for, the, perception, of, musicality,, where, "musicality", is, actually, a, perceived, property, of, speech., "Musicality", refers, to, the, property, of, music, that, determines, how, "good", it, is,, how, strong, an, emotional, effect, it, has,, and, how, much, we, enjoy, listening, to, it., The, theory, implies, that, ordinary, speech, also, has, this, property,, in, a, manner, which, may, vary, as, a, person, speaks., The, musicality, of, speech, is, much, more, subtle, than, that, of, music,, but, it, provides, important, information, which, the, listener's, brain, processes, (without, conscious, awareness, of, the, processing),, in, order, to, derive, some, information, about, the, internal, mental, state, of, the, speaker., This, information, is, applied, to, modulate, the, listener's, emotional, response, to, speech,, and, this, accounts, for, the, emotional, effect, of, music., What, distinguishes, the, super-stimulus, theory, from, all, other, serious, attempts, to, explain, music, scientifically, is, that, it, starts, from, a, simple, assumption, that, music, perception, must, be, an, information, processing, function,, and, this, assumption, results, in, quite, specific, explanations, of, how, major, aspects, of, music, such, as, scales,, regular, beat, and, harmony, are, processed, in, the, brain., It, is, the, first, theory, to, explain, the, perception, of, musical, scales, without, a, priori, assuming, the, existence, of, musical, scales., (The, theory, has, to, do, this,, because, it, is, a, theory, of, music, perception, as, an, aspect, of, speech, perception,, and, musical, scales, do, not, occur, in, normal, speech.), The, book, is, now, available, as, a, free, download.,  Copyright © 2006-2015 Philip Dorrell]
