Posted, by, C., D., Harvill, in, Uncategorized, C., D., Harvill, trendi10.com, This, past, week, I, had, the, opportunity, to, meet, with, someone, who, is,, arguably,, one, of, the, best, guitarists, to, come, out, of, the, Gulf, Coast., Many, along, the, Florida-Alabama, shore, may, have, heard, of, Guthrie, Trapp., From, a, young, age,, Guthrie,, was, intrigued, with, music., He, grew, up, listening, not, to, the, radio,, but, his, family’s, collection, of, bluegrass,, folk,, and, rock, and, roll, records., While, hanging, around, his, uncle,, who, was, a, self-taught, musician,, he, started, playing, around, with, different, instruments., Although, Guthrie, did, attend, some, workshops,, he, mostly, honed, his, musical, abilities, by, going, to, live, shows,, listening, to, different, music,, and, hanging, out, with, his, uncle., “I, just, picked, up, on, it., Those, are, the, things, you, can’t, teach, somebody., You, can’t, learn, how, to, play, with, soul, or, feeling, from, a, school,, you, just, have, it.”, First, Guthrie, learned, to, play, the, harmonica., He, quickly, grew, bored, with, the, instrument’s, simplicity, and, picked, up, guitar, and, later, the, mandolin., Unlike, most, musicians, trying, to, make, a, living, along, the, Gulf, Coastal, region,, Guthrie, never, had, to, play, Jimmy, Buffet, covers., “Most, people, have, to, play, cover, music., I, never, did, down, there., I, was, so, lucky, I, never, had, to., I, was, either, playing, with, Gove, (Gove, Scrivenor),, or, with, the, Filthy, Rich, Band., We, played, all, of, our, own, music.”, Barely, an, adult,, Guthrie, was, paired, up, with, Nick, Branch,, playing, original, music, in, the, Filthy, Rich, band., They, shined, throughout, the, region, with, their, intense, blues,, roots,, and, swing, guitar, power., They, even, traveled, overseas., Being, such, an, accomplished, musician, and, having, his, pick, of, places, to, live,, why, did, Guthrie, pick, Nashville, to, call, home?, Guthrie, explained, he, never, had, a, thought, of, moving, to, New, York, or, Los, Angeles,, partially, because, Guthrie, does, not, read, music, and, the, Nashville, Number, System, is, not, frowned, upon, in, its, name, sake, town,, but, also, because, Guthrie,, despite, his, success,, is, a, laid, back, guy., While, kicked, back, on, his, couch, he, shared,, “I, just, knew, that, Nashville, was, happening., I, never, had, a, thought, of, moving, to, one, of, those, places…, I, never, had, a, plan,, it, just, happened,, I, was, in, my, early, twenties, and, it, was, time, to, move, away, from, that, hometown., I’m, glad, I, did”,, he, also, stated,, “People, here, are, from, small, towns,, I’m, from, a, small, town”., Due, to, his, career, really, kicking, off, in, Nashville,, and, his, touring, with, Patty, Loveless,, some, people, pigeonholed, Guthrie,, as, a, guitarist,, in, the, country/bluegrass, genre., Guthrie, made, it, very, clear, it’s, just, not, true., His, current, personal, project,, “18, South”,, where, he, has, equal, footing, with, the, other, members, (including:, Larry, Atamanuik, on, drums,, Mike, Bub, on, doghouse, bass,, Jimmi, Wallace, with, piano, and, vocals,, Jon, Randall, with, vocals, and, rhythm, guitar,, and, Jessi, Alexander’s, vocals.), may, give, him, a, bit, broader, palette, to, express, his, versatile, guitar, skills,, but, it, is, still, not, a, far, cry, from, bluegrass,, nor, is, it, precisely, what, Guthrie, would, put, together, if, given, free, reign., Guthrie, opened, his, laptop, and, put, on, a, video, to, help, describe, to, me, what, he, would, enjoy, playing, the, most., The, sound, I, heard, was, more, of, a, funk/experimental, jazz,, a, description, with, which, Guthrie, agrees., Such, a, sound, would, truly, give, Guthrie, the, room, a, guitarist, of, his, caliber, needs, to, stretch, himself, as, a, musician., If, you, don’t, recall, hearing, Guthrie, play, with, Allison, Kraus,, Jerry, Douglas,, Patty, Loveless,, Earl, Scruggs, or, various, other, artists,, then, I, suggest, you, check, out, “18, South”, on, Myspace., With, Jon, Randall, having, written, a, hit, like, Whiskey, Lullaby,, Jessi, Alexander, having, written, one, of, the, latest, Miley, Cyrus, chart, toppers,, The, Climb,, and, Guthrie, Trapp’s, guitar, runs,, you, better, believe, you,
