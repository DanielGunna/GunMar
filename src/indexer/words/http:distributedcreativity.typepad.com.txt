Introduction:, Traditionally,, political, concepts, and, goals, of, emancipation, were, based, either, on, objectivism, or, formalism., Most, often, it, was, a, mixture, of, both., In, the, first, case,, there, is, supposedly, an, objective, insight, into, truth,, history,, society,, and, human, nature., Everything, that, is, wrong, is, deducted., In, the, latter, case,, supposedly, formal, societal, structures , (or, smaller, cooperations), determine, an, outcome, that, can, be, labeled, as, freedom,, equality,, or, control., Of, course,, objectivism, is, a, highly, problematic, concept, itself, now,, rightly, under, attack, from, postmodern, critics., Political, formalism, mostly, ignores, that, relationships, of, power, that, are, in, fact, what, determines, the, outcome., This, is, not, an, academic, question;, a, lot, of, emancipatory, politics, turned, out, to, be, part, of, the, problem, rather, than, the, solution., The, concept, of, free, cooperation, is, an, attempt, to, base, emancipation,, political, theory, and, left, politics, once, more, on, free, negotiations, and, equal, negotiating, power., It, can, be, applied, to, any, kind, of, cooperation,, from, society, at, large, to, educational, projects,, from, new, media, art, to, economy-, it, is, an, utopian, guideline, for, progressive, transformation., About, Christoph, Spehr:, Christoph, Spehr, is, a, German, political, and, cultural, theorist,, author, and, video-maker., In, 2001, he, got, the, Rosa-Luxemburg-prize, for, his, essay, on, Free, Cooperation;, an, English, translation, will, be, available, in, 2005., Since, 2000, he, is, the, organizer, of, the, conference, series, Out, of, this, world, which, focuses, on, the, relationships, between, popular, culture,, exp., Science-Fiction,, utopian, concepts, and, political, emancipation., He, works, as, an, editor, for, the, magazine, Alaska, and, takes, part, in, the, Historical-Critical, Dictionary, of, Marxism, project., His, video, On, Rules, and, Monsters, was, screened, at, the, Networks,, Art, &, Collaboration, Conference,, SUNY, at, Buffalo,, 2004., Video, (German), in, Speaker, Series, |, This, section, only, |, Transcript, (1), 01.26, Elizabeth, Goodman,, Nathalie, Jeremijenko, Avocational, Training:, Teaching, New, Media, In, Old, Institutions, Introduction:, Graduate, and, undergraduate, art, schools, are, beginning, to, include, classes, and, programs, focused, on, "new", media, (getting, older, every, day), as, an, accepted, -, not, experimental, -, part, of, their, curricula., Yet, in, the, seeming, absence, of, an, established, pedagogical, tradition,, these, programs, must, negotiate, an, appropriate, balance, between, skill, development, and, conceptual, exploration., The, situation, is, complicated, by, the, new, emphasis, on, students-as-consumers, and, the, financial, pressures, on, both, students, and, institutions., We, cannot, productively, address, these, tensions, (and, defuse, some, common, frustrations), without, respecting, the, legitimate, needs,, concerns,, and, positions, of, the, constituencies, involved, -, students,, administrators,, and, teachers, alike., About, Elizabeth, Goodman:, Elizabeth, Goodman's, design,, writing,, and, research, focuses, on, critical, thinking, and, creative, exploration, at, the, intersections, of, new, digital, technologies,, social, life, and, urban, spaces., She, has, a, master's, degree, from, New, York, University's, Interactive, Telecommunications, Program, and, has, spent, this, fall, as, a, visiting, lecturer, on, site, specific, art, and, wireless, networks, at, the, San, Francisco, Art, Institute, (download, course, bibliography,, .pdf) ., More, examples, of, Elizabeth's, work, in, urban, gaming, and, cellphone, interfaces, can, be, found, at, www.confectious.net., Schmedagogy:, Changing, Structures, of, Participation, In, New, Media, Education, Introduction:, What, opportunities, do, new, technologies, provide, to, transform, and, improve, pedagogy,, particularly, in, the, context, of, digital, and, technology, based, curricula?, I, will, discuss, four, experiments, in, two, distinct, arenas., Firstly, in, the, realm, of, internet-based,, or, asynchronous, and, cumulative, learning, context, I, will, present, two, projects--, SCAPE:, a, friendster/, napster, hybrid, that, facilitates, file-sharing, through, social, networks;, and, HSIM:, a, wiki-based, visual, encyclopedia, that , documents, labor, conditions, and, manufacturing, processes., The, former, focuses, on, group, forming, and,, the, latter, builds, interaction, between, industry, and, academia., Both, develop, evidence, that, the, way, we, structure, participation, changes, what, information, is, produced,, who, produces, it,, and, how, it, circulates., Both, provide, material, to, question, what, these, changes, may, mean, for, learning., In, the, 2nd, realm, I, will, discuss, the, opportunity, presented, by, synchronous, and, co-present, contexts., In, two, projects, I, explore, the, potential, of, a), computer, labs, and, b), outdoor, public, space, for, effective, participation, in, interpretive, learning., Computer, lab, spaces, are, still, new, spaces,, the, first, to, have, appeared, in, educational, institutions, in, decades., They, present, the, opportunity, to, facilitate, the, sort, of, learning, that, is, under, achieved, in, other, institutionalized, learning, spaces, (lecture, hall,, classrooms,, bench, labs,, library)., In, the, last, 15, years, many, different, computer, lab, designs, have, been, implemented,, in, particular, in, engineering, and, new, media, education,, and, in, institutions, of, informal, learning, (museums, and, galleries)., These, have, produced, some, insights, in, how, physical, and, social, resources, effect, interactions, therein--and, I, will, present, empirical, results, from, an, extensive, ethnographic, analysis, and, design, propositions., In, contrast, to, lab, space, inside, institutions,, taking, and, facilitate, learning, into, outdoor, public, space, can, also, change, who, participates, in, the, learning, activity., Using, mobile, computational, platforms, 'in, the, wild', provides, a, study, of, how, people, exchange, information, and, interpret, results, that, are, rendered, for, the, diverse, participants, that, come, with, public, sites., Each, of, these, projects, suggest, that, the, structure, of, participation, is, a, primary, pedagogical, effect, that, can, be, changed,, and, potentially, improved, with, the, introduction, of, computation., About, Natalie, Jeremijenko:, Natalie, Jeremijenko,, is, an, Assistant, Professor, in, Visual, Art,, UCSD,, the, McPherson, Visiting, Professor, in, the, Public, Understanding, of, Science, at, Michigan, State, University,, and, the, 2005, holder, of, the, Mildred, C., Brinn, Endowed, Chair, at, Skowhegan.,

Introduction:, Thinking, about, educators, some, may, argue, that, there, is, no, room, for, the, personal, politics, of, the, professor, in, the, classroom., We, disagree., The, Greek, word, "professore", means, ", to, proclaim.", It, does, not, mean, "say, nothing,, look, the, other, side, when, hundreds, of, people, die, in, Iraq,, when, our, civil, liberties, vanish, under, the, Patriot, Act,, academic, freedom, of, speech, is, questioned,, or, when, the, International, Monetary, Fund, ruins, yet, another, Jamaica., About, Megan, Boler:, Knowledge,, Media,, Design, Institute,

Box, Introduction:, The, ever-changing, nature, of, the, Web,, creates, a, highly, disparate, teaching, environment., After, years, of, presenting, Macromedia, products, in, Web, courses,, it, has, become, clear, that, these, products, are, insufficient, and, are, contrary, to, the, most, exciting, innovations, of, the, Web,, those, of, the, Open, Source, movement. , A, shift, of, focus, from, corporate, products, to, utilizing, Source, Forge, projects, and, other, open, source, technologies, will, be, discussed,, such, as:, jEdit,, Movable, Type,, PHP..., About, Ricardo, Miranda, Zuniga:,

This, section, only, |, Transcript, (1), 02.16, Patrick, Lichty, A, Culture, of, Cooperation, Introduction:, The, distributed, social, structure, of, the, Internet, created, an, environment, in, which, collective, action, and, collaborative, projects, can, flourish. , Net, art,, blogging,, RSS, aggregators,, open, source,, tele-performance,, WIKI,, netconferencing,, and, other, movements, allow, a, culture, of, cooperation, which, is, unique, to, this, period, in, time. , How, have, these, technologies, changed, previous, paradigms, of, collaboration? , Furthermore,, how, can, distributed, forms, of, interaction, be, used, to, create, models, of, education, that, respond, fluidly, to, the, rapidly, changing, technoculture,, and, to, place, students, in, the, presence, of, leading, practitioners, in, any, given, field?, About, Patrick, Lichty:, Patrick, Lichty, is, a, technologically-based, conceptual, artist,, writer,, independent, curator,, and, Executive, Editor, of,

driver, of, online, content, development., In, addition, to, some, of, the, better-known, p2p, communication, forms, such, as, filesharing,, however,, we, are, now, also, witnessing, the, emergence, of, a, wide, range, of, p2p, publishing, models., These, range, from, solitary,, diary-style, weblogs, (blogs), to, communal, blogspaces, which, place, individual, blogs, within, elaborate, interconnecting, extrastructures,, and, beyond, this, to, increasingly, sophisticated, websites, for, the, open, publishing, and, discussion, of, special, interest, news., This, form, of, communal, publishing, replaces, traditional, journalistic, gatekeeping, approaches, with, a, new, gatewatching, model,, and, (implicitly, or, explicitly), applies, the, philosophy, of, the, open, source, software, development, movement, to, news, reporting, and, publishing,, leading, to, what, can, be, described, as, open, news., About, Axel, Bruns:, Media, &, Communication, Discipline,, Creative,

Transcript, (0), 03.16, Eduardo, Navas,, Randall, Packer, Case, Study:, Diary, of, a, Star, and, Net, Art, Review, Introduction:, A, question, that, often, arises, about, blogs, is, how, they, affect, cultures, around, the, globe. , In, relation, to, this, I, am, interested, in, how, blogs, can, play, a, role, in, the, dissemination, of, knowledge, and, how, they, are, affecting, the, development, of, new, knowledge., In, my, presentation,, I, will, consider, the, dichotomy, of, the, individual, blog, vs., the, group, blog, as, tools, for, dissemination. , I, will, explain, how, I, see, Net, Art, Review, functioning, as, a, multi-faceted, group, blog, that, can, be, used, for, educational, purposes, which, extend, outside, the, classroom, and, is, more, of, a, service, to, many, online, communities. , I, will, also, talk, about, Diary, of, a, Star, which, is, a, critical, take, on, blogging, that, appropriates, selections, from, the, Andy, Warhol, Diaries;, a, project, that , uses, blogging, as, a, tool, for, art, discourse., About, Eduardo, Navas:, Eduardo, Navas, is, active, as, an, interdisciplinary, artist, currently, doing, research, as, a, Ph.D., Graduate, Fellow, in, the,

co-founding, member, of, acute.cc,, an, international, network, of, artists, and, academics, who, organize, international, events, and, publications, periodically., Freedom, of, Discourse:, Political, Consciousness, in, the, Classroom, Introduction:, Since, 9/11,, the, classroom, has, increasingly, become, an, environment, for, discourse, focused, on, a, world, in, crisis,, particularly, the, cultural,, political, and, religious, clash, between, East, &, West., The, War, in, Iraq, only, heightened, the, need, to, use, the, academic, setting, as, a, platform, for, exploring, issues, that, have, emerged, from, the, conflict., However,, there, has, been, pressure, on, professors, and, teachers, to, censor, this, type, of, discussion, for, fear, it, might, oppose, the, political, views, of, students,, or, force, certain, views, on, the, student., This,, in, my, opinion,, flies, in, the, face, of, the, very, core, of, education,, in, which, a, variety, of, views, are, discussed, and, debated,, freely, and, openly., This, talk, will, focus, on, freedom, of, speech,, and, freedom, of, topic, in, the, classroom:, should, professors, be, able, to, incorporate, political, events, and, issues, into, their, teaching, without, censor,, particularly, in, the, arts,, where, contemporary, issues, and, their, critique, are, a, vital, component, of, art, practice., About, Randall, Packer:, Randall, Packer, is, internationally, recognized, as, a, pioneering, artist,, composer,, educator,, and, scholar, in, the, field, of, multimedia., His, work, has, been, exhibited, at, museums, and,

texts, in, the, field., Packer, is, concerned, with, the, aesthetic,, philosophical,, and, socio-cultural, impact, of, new, media, in, an, increasingly, technological, society., Since, moving, to, Washington,, DC, in, 2000,, his, work, has, explored, the, critique, of, the, role, of, the, artist, in, society, and, politics., He, founded, the, virtual, government, agency, US, Department, of, Art, and, Technology, (www.usdat.us), in, 2001,, which, proposes, and, supports, the, idealized, definition, of, the, artist, as, one, whose, reflections,, ideas,, aesthetics,, sensibilities,, and,

Introduction:, Decentralization, has, always, been, regarded, as, one, of, the, advantages, of, new, technologies., But, it, might, have, come, to, a, slight, surprise, for, the, old, centers, that, a, few, places, in, between, newyorkberlintokyo, took, this, notion, literally, and, started, their, own, business., Blessed, with, an, amazing, economic, growth,, Asia, has, added, itself, onto, the,

and, the, technophobia, often, encountered, in, more, traditional, cultural, theorists?, What, can, we, do, about, anti-intellectualism, and, boredom, in, the, undergraduate, classroom?, Concrete, examples, of, useful, assignments, and, ways, in, which, to, teach, theory, or, tech, (ie., How, could, the, role, plays, proposed, by, Augusto, Boal's, "Games, for, Actors, and, Non-actors", be,

Institute, for, Telecommunications, and, Information, Technology., Interdisciplinarity, and, Critical, Technical, Practices., Introduction, As, computer, automated, cultural, artifacts, emerge,, an, aesthetics, of, interaction, between, people, and, machine, systems, presents, itself, as, a, novel, new, field, of, aesthetics,, a, poetics, of, interaction, opposing, or, complementing, the, instrumentality, of, some, aspects, of, human, computer, interaction., Such, practices, have, only, been, viable, since, the, availability, of, real-time, computing, technologies, and, techniques., This, work, is, both, technically, and, theoretically, rigorous,, as, developing, such, systems, adds, aesthetic,, theoretical, and, philosophical, considerations, seldom, engaged, in, digital, technology, design., It, is, quintessentially, interdisciplinary,, drawing, upon, diverse, intellectual, resources,, including, robotics,, cultural, studies,, human, computer, interaction,, art, practice,, interaction, design,, art, history, and, cognitive, science., In, engaging, these, diverse, fields,, it, thus, demands, reconciliation, of, often, antithetical, positions, in, the, history, of, ideas, in, the, west., About, Simon, Penny:, Simon, Penny, is, an, Australian, artist,, theorist, and, teacher, in, the, field, of, Digital, Cultural, Practices, and, Computer, Automated,

Understanding, ELearning, on, the, Internet, Introduction:, In, this, presentation, we, will, briefly, review, the, history, of, computers, in, learning, and, education, from, circa, 1970, to, the, present., We, describe, how, the, growth, of, the, Internet, has, created, the, possibility, for, the, design, of, new, learning, environments, and, new, forms, of, learning, and, education., It, will, be, argued, that, many, of, these, new,, Internet-based, learning, environments, are, strongly, dependent, upon, the, exchange, of, email, between, teachers, and, learners., We, will, demonstrate, a, prototype, system, for, visualizing, and, summarizing, large, volumes, of, email,, the, Conversation, Map, system,, and, consider, its, possible, use, in, the, evaluation, of, these, new, learning, environments., We, further, explore, how, new, work, environments, for, networked,, collaborative, production, --, like, the, tools, used, by, the, Open, Source, Software, (OSS), communities, --, can, also, be, conceptualized, as, learning, environments, akin, to, pre-industrial,, "workshops", where, "apprentices", learn, by, assisting, more, experienced, "craftsmen", (where, "craftsmen", in, this, context, are, programmers, and, software, designers)., Automatically, generated, isualizations, of, these, work-environments-as-learning, environments, will, illustrate, the, final, portion, of, the, presentation., link, About, Warren, Sack:, Warren, Sack, is, a, software, designer, and, media, theorist, whose, work, explores, theories, and, designs, for, online, public, space, and, public, discussion., http://people.ucsc.edu/~wsack, in, Speaker, Series, |, This, section, only, |, Transcript, (0), 04.27, Anna, Munster,, Molly, Krause, Web, Designer, or, Web, Author?, Introduction:, When, new, media, arts, and, design, departments, in, art, schools, began, teaching, students, how, to, make, websites, a, few, years, ago,, the, terms, and, practices, of, design, theory, and, culture, were, implemented, as, the, unquestioned, pedagogical, platform., Now, we, have, moved, into, a, phase, of, direct-to-web, publishing,, should, we, be, questioning, the, usefulness, of, this, platform? , Are, issues, concerning, information, literacy,, the, ability, to, be, an, information, researcher,, content, management,, intellectual, property,, copyright, and, copyleft, becoming, more, important, for, students, working, in, and, with, the, web? , What, does, it, mean, to, be, a, web, author, rather, than, a, web, designer?, Can, we, teach, critical, web, design, and , informed, web, authoring?, What, might, sites, look, like, if, we, were, able, to, combine, both, of, these?, About, Anna, Munster:, Anna, Munster, is, a, writer,, artist, and, educator., She, teaches, at, the, College, of, Fine, Arts,, University, of, New, South, Wales., She, is, a, facilitator, of, the, online, project, 'fibreculture', (www.fibreculture.org)., Currently, she, is, completing, a, book, for, the, University, of, New, England, Press, on, new, media, aesthetics, and, bodies, -, Materializing, New, Media, -, due, for, publication, later, this, year., Case, Study:, H20, Project, Introduction:, H2O, is, an, innovative, open-source, platform, for, education, that, freely, provides, syllabi, and, other, scholarly, content, to, teachers, and, students, across, the, globe,, while, also, linking, them, in, networks,, communities, and, valuable, discussions, around, common, or, associated, resources, and, academic, goals., Although, networks, and, digital, technologies, can, now, be, found, in, schoolsand, universities, around, the, world,, their, potential, to, transform, education, has, not, yet, been, achieved., Current, tools, --, email,, websearches,, digital, syllabi, and, message, boards, --, are, useful,, but, they, merely, project, the, stand, alone, classroom, model, online., Using, H2O,, the, best, of, what, is, in, each, classroom, can, be, brought, to, every, other:, one, teacher’s, good, idea, for, how, to, teach, a, topic, can, be, shared, with, and, built, upon, by, another;, a, curious, searcher, can, be, matched, with, others, exploring, the, same, idea;, an, interesting, discussion, among, classmates, can, become, a, powerful, discussion, among, and, across, entire, classrooms,, each, approaching, the, subject, from, a, distinct, social, perspective., H2O, is, determined, to, transform, education, by, developing, tools, that, enable, true, interaction, across, classrooms, and, by, providing, an, online, home, for, their, use, that, connects, educators, and, learners, together., We, look, forward, to, soliciting, feedback, on, both, our, technical, changes, and, organizational, plans, from, participants, and, leaders, of, this, WebCamTalk, 1.0, Series., About, Molly, Krause:, H2O, Presenter, Molly, serves, as, project, coordinator, for, the, Berkman, Center’s, H2O, Project., Her, duties, include, leading, the, platform’s, non-technical, uses, and, applications,, fundraising,, marketing, and, resource, management., She, also, participates, in, high-level, technical, design, and, evaluation, and, researches, the, evolving, relationship, of, technology, and, education., Prior, to, the, Berkman, Center,, Molly, worked, for, IBM, in, its, Strategic, Consulting, Services, division,, where, she, worked, with, its, large, corporate, clients, to, build, information, technology, environments, that, would, achieve, their, business, needs, and, goals., Molly, received, her,

which, media, they, use., Between, Futurist, narratives, of, progress, with, all, their, techno-optimism, and, the, technophobia, often, encountered, in, more, traditional, cultural, theorists--, how, do, we, educate, students, to, be, equally, familiar, with, technical, concepts,, theory,, and, art?, How, can, new-media, theory, be, activated, as, a, wake-up, call, for, students, leading, to, radical, sea, change?, Which, educational, structure, proves, more, effective--, theme-based, groups, or, media-based, departments?, Does, the, current, new-media, art, curriculum, allow, for, play,, experiment, and, failure?, How, can, we, introduce, free, software, into, the, new-media, classroom, when, businesses, still, hardly, make, use, of, open, source, or, free, software?, How, can, we, break, out, of, the, isolating, walls, of, the, university, lab?, This, series, will, introduce, concrete, examples, of, meaningful, linkages, between, media, production, in, the, university, and, cultural, institutions, as, well, as, technology, businesses., Guest, speakers, will, also, address, ways, in, which, they, introduce, politics, into, the, new-media, lab., Between, flattened, sing-along, hierarchies, and, the, traditional, models, of, top-down, education,, speakers, will, give, examples, based, on, their, experiences, that, offer, a, middle-ground, between, these, extremes., Further, questions, address, anti-intellectualism, in, the, classroom, and, the, high, demands, on, educators, in, this, area, in, which, technology, and, theory, are, with, little, precedence, and, rapidly, change., As, a, response, to, the, latter, question, several, distributed, learning, tools, will, be, presented, that, internationally, link, up, new-media, educators, to,
