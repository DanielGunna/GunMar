where, Paul, Verhoeven, represents cinéma, du, papa, it, makes, sense, that, a, younger, generation, of, filmmakers, would, produce, something, like Brimstone., Calling, back, to, Verhoeven’s, earthy,, sex-drenched, cinema, of, the, 1970s,, but, updating, it, with, the, gory, sensibilities, of, a, contemporary, horror, movie, Brimstone, is, a, spectacularly, lurid, melodrama, that, seeks, to, excuse, indulgences, both, bloody, and, lewd, by, catching, them, up, in, a, lecture, about, runaway, misogyny,, which, is, used, as, a, stick, with, which, to, beat, its, heroine, nearly, to, death, over, and, over, again. Brimstone, is, the, kind, of, movie, where, a, bullet, wound, is, rarely, just, a, bullet, wound, —, generally, it’s, the goo-slick, remnants, of, a, head, shot,, with, blood, spatter, plus, a, little, puddle,, and, a, few, gobbets, of, brain, matter, sprinkled, around, the, scene, like, so, much, sea, salt, on, a, plate, of, raw, meat., It’s, the, kind, of, movie, where, a, child, is, not, only, placed, in, peril,, but, is, outright, tortured, on, screen., And, it’s, the, kind, of, movie, where, a, woman, absolutely,, positively, cannot, catch, a, goddamned, break., Continue, reading, →, Blu-ray,, Grindhouse,, Movie, Reviews, Blood, Diner, 52/100November, 3,, 2016, Bryant, Leave, a, comment, So, bad, it’s, good?, I, wouldn’t, go, that, far., But, Blood, Diner, is, definitely, something—a, no-frills, pastiche, of, 1950s, disembodied-brain, sci-fi, potboiler,, 1960s, Herschell, Gordon, Lewis, splatter, movie,, 1970s, cannibal-cuisine, flick,, and, early-1980s, buddy-cop, movie., I’m, tempted, to, say, it, stitches, together, a, Frankenstein’s, patchwork, of, genre, movies, because, it, has, no, vision, of, its, own,, but, that’s, too, glib.,

not, the, shopping-center, slasher-movie, its, title, suggests., Here’s, what, you, really, need, to, know:, It, includes, a, scene, where, a, woman, clad, in, light-blue, Playboy, panties, runs, screaming, through, the, spacious, halls, of, the, Sherman, Oaks, Galleria, in, a, hail, of, laser, fire,, chased, by, a, killer, robot, resembling, a, cross, between, a, Dalek, from, Doctor, Who,

of, those, salutary, coincidences, of, movie, history, that, the, final, narrative, film, completed, by, Orson, Welles, would, turn, out, to, be, this, rumination, on, an, old, man’s, obsession, with, storytelling., It’s, not, that, Welles, was, exactly, elderly, at, the, time, (he, was, 51, when, he, made, it),, but, there’s, a, matter-of-fact, finality, to, the, work, that, becomes, just, a, touch, spooky, in, retrospect., Commissioned, by, the, French, national, television, agency, as, a, Jeanne, Moreau, vehicle, to, commemorate, the, […], Read, this, review, at, FilmFreakCentral, ..., "movies, about, movies""orson, welles"french, In, Theaters,, Movie, Reviews, Elle, 71/100September, 26,, 2016, Bryant, Leave, a, comment, The, first, thing, that, happens, in, Elle, is, something, that’s, heard, but, not, seen, — the, sounds, of, heavy, breathing, and, bodies, in, motion,, rubbing, against, each, other., It’s, almost, certainly, the, sound, of, a, sex, scene,, but, there’s, an, aggression, to, it, that, suggests, either, exceptionally, good, sex, or, really,, really, bad, sex, — an, act, of, violence., The, smash, of, breaking, glass, is, inconclusive,, and, the, quick, gasps, and, grunts, don’t, clarify, a, thing;, divorced, from, visual, context,, they, are, uncommunicative,, inconclusive, fragments, of, expression., It’s, an, unnerving, way, to, stage, what, is, eventually, revealed, as, a, horrifying, scene, —, a, woman, is, brutally, raped, by, a, masked, intruder, —, and, of, course, Paul, Verhoeven, knows, it.,  The, director’s, first, major, film, in, 10, years, is, as, sensational, a, crime, drama, as, you’d, expect, from, the, director, of, Basic, Instinct, and, Showgirls,, a, cutting, psychological, study, anchored, by, ugly,, explicit, rape, scenes., Its, restrained look, and, feel, are, a, far, cry, from, the, gleeful, chaos, favored, by the, Verhoeven, of, the, 1970s,, the, poster, boy, for, Dutch, auteurism, on, the, international, scene., That, filmmaker, all, but, vanished, during, the, director’s, stay, in, Hollywood,, only, to, resurface, with, the, pulpy, and absorbing, Nazi, resistance, drama, Black, Book., But, as, lurid, as, Elle, is,, Verhoeven’s, style, is, resolutely, low-key., I, suspect, he’s, deliberately, channeling, the, austere, Euro-drama, of, Michael, Haneke,, couching, his, irrepressible, mischievousness, in, the, international, language, of, the, arthouse., Continue, reading, →, "isabelle, huppert""paul, verhoeven"raperape-revenge, DVD/Blu-ray,, Grindhouse,, Movie, Reviews,, On, Demand, Meat, 57/100September, 19,, 2016, (Updated, September, 26,, 2016), Bryant, 1, Comment, Philly-based, distributor, Artsploitation, Films, has, just, pulled, a, Dutch, film, called, Meat, (aka, Vlees,, 2010), out, of, the, freezer,, and, it’s, kind, of, a, doozy., Produced, by, Amsterdam-based, co-directors, Maartje, Seyferth, and, Victor, Nieuwenhuijs, (she’s, the, writer,, he’s, the, cinematographer),, Meat, is, a, nonlinear, murder, mystery, that, starts, out, as, day-in-the-life, middle-aged, sexual, intrigue,, morphs, briefly, into, one, of, those, young-people-and-discotheques, Euroflicks,, and, finally, turns, into, a, post-modern, police, procedural., It’s, not, much, of, a, whodunit,, but, it’s, a, pretty, good, example, of, a, 21st-century, grindhouse, film,, serving, up, pungent, elements, of, low-budget, horror, and, surrealism, with, erotic, aromatics, and, a, permeating, abattoir, stench., But, I, don’t, want, to, oversell, it., Just, think, Luis, Buñuel, crossed, with,

The, Neon, Demon‘s, opening, scene,, a, staged, tableaux, that, has, the, aspiring, model, (Elle, Fanning), slumped, on, a, settee,, head, back,, covered, in, a, rush, of, blood, as, if, her, throat’s, been, cut,, it’s, clear, that, she’s, doomed., Her, demeanor, in, front, of, the, camera, is, compared, to, a, “deer, in, the, headlights.”, She, has, no, family,, no, friends,, and, nobody, keeping, tabs, on, her, after, her, arrival, in, L.A., She, has, full, lips,, big, eyes,, and, a, delightful, nose., She, is, 16, years, old,, and, everyone, she, meets, comments, on, her,

Reviews, Midnight, Special, 75/100June, 1,, 2016, Bryant, Leave, a, comment, Midnight, Special, is, readily, understood, as, a, film, about, being, a, parent, who, loves, a, child, so, much, — and, of, course, there, are, plenty, of, movies, about, people, who, love, their, children,, so, a, common, objection, is, that, this, one, is, too, humorless, and, withholds, action, and, who, needs, that?, But, there’s, something, about, the, way, this, film, depicts, the, way, adults, interact, with, the, child, in, question, —, not, so, much, a, cute, kid, like, you’d, see, in, a, Steven, Spielberg, movie,, but, a, weird, kid, like, you’d, read, about, in, a, Stephen, King, novel, —, that’s, as, heartening, as, it, is, serious, and sad., It, works, as, a, metaphor, for, raising, an, autistic, child,, or, a, physically, ill, child,, or, a, prodigy,, or, some, other, young, handful., The, climactic, visualization, of, the, remove, between, young, Alton, and, his, surroundings, isn’t, tremendously, satisfying, as, an, action, set, piece,, but, it’s, a, solid, science-fiction, metaphor,, and, it, makes, better, emotional, sense, here, than, the, same, gimmick, did, in Tomorrowland., But, in, its, presentation, of, confidence, and, selflessness, as, imperatives, for, parents, and, parental, surrogates,, Midnight, Special plays like, a, stoic,, even-keeled, answer, film, to, the, crisis, of, faith, posed, by The, Babadook., Continue, reading, →, "science, fiction""think, of, the, children"parenting, Posts, navigation, 1, 2, …, 93, Next, →, Suggested,

Bryant, Leave, a, comment, I, think, of, her, as, a, kind, of, spiritual, successor, to, Kate, Bush,, but, there’s, something, special, about, Lorde’s, stage, and, screen, presence, —, an, introspective, yet, theatrical, witchiness, that, suggests, a, public, persona, still, sorting, itself, out., It’s, highlighted, well, in, Emily, Kai, Bock’s, music, video, for, “Yellow, Flicker,
