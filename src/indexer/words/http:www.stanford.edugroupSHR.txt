collection, of, essays, by, leading, scholars, in, the, different, literary, fields, and, methodologies,, focusing, on, the, institutional, origins, and, implementations, of, those, discursive,

Hoover, Institution, and, in, Green, Library's, Special, Collections,, and, it, brought, together, a, remarkable, cross-section, of, advanced, students, from, disciplines, as, variegated, as,

triumph, in, various, parts, of, the, globe, during, the, 1920s, and, 1930s., Rather,, the, seminar, was, set, up, as, an, interdisciplinary, research, forum, concerned, with, the, socioeconomic,, cultural,, and, technological, preconditions, that, played, different, roles, as, catalysts, for, the, emergence, of, fascism, -, even, if, their, relationship, to, 'fascism', can, rarely, be,
