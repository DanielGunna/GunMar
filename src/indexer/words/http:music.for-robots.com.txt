But, I, love, how, the, women, in, Girlpool, use, this, to, great, effect:, it’s, a, song, about, the, loss, of, love—friendship?, Something, more?—and, the, voices, weave, in, and, out,, usually, settling, on, the, same, notes, and, words,, creating, a, united, front, for, the, good, of, companionship., You, can, find, Before, The, World, Was, Big, in, all, the, usual, places,, but, why, not,

I’ve, been, making, mixes, on, a, semi-monthly, basis., Through, various, moves, across, the, country, I’ve, lost, or, broken, most, of, them,, but, occasionally, I, come, across, one, in, a, box, or, a, pile, or, tucked, into, a, book., They, are, never, perfect;, far, from, it., They, are, always, works, in, progress,, like, small, snapshots, of, what, I, thought, I, might, like, at, the, time., Sometimes, I, immediately, hate, them, and, never, listen, again., Other, times, they, become, well-worn, favorites., I, figured, that, enough, time, has, passed, that, I, could, dissect, a, few, here, and, there, on, the, site., For, this, second, entry,, we, go, to, early, summer, of, 2007., I, don’t, have, an, exact, date, but, that’s, roughly, when, this, thing, came, from., Full, track,

I, Hope, You, Know, If, this, were, 2005,, those, naive, early, days,, I, would’ve, arrogantly, demanded, that, the, band, let, me, post, an, mp3, of, their, song, “Choices”, off, Scatter,, because, holy, crap, is, that, a, song., It’s, also, the, most, 2005, song, I’ve, heard, in, ages, and, would’ve, given, the, Bloc, Party’s, Silent, Alarm, a, run, for, its, money,, which, is, no, easy, feat., Simply, comprised, of, a, drummer, and, a, guitarist,, both, from, South, London,, Crushed, Beaks, are, everything, I’m, a, sucker, for., And, don’t, worry,, “Overgrown”, here, is, a, fine, song, –, one, of, the, best, on, the, album, –, but, their, album, definitely, puts, me, in, the, headspace, of, a, foolhardy, young, blogger, and, that’s, totally, what, I, would’ve, done, because, I, was, a, dick, like, that., We, grow, and, we, learn!, ANYway,, you, should, get, their, album, because, it’s, awesome., 02/12/2015, 7:27, pm, 3, Comments|, mark, I’m, So, Twisted, <a,

This, belongs, at, the, end, of, Side, 1, of, a, cassette,, slowly, letting, you, down, after, a, long, ride., It, shares, DNA, with, indie, four, trackers, from, the, old, days,, like, Ben, Lee, —, that, feeling, of, privacy, you, get, from, a, home, recording., At, first, listen, this, doesn’t, appear, to, owe, much, to, Girlpool’s, Los, Angeles, surroundings, but, then, they, hit, that, note, in, “Realize”, and, I, am, instantly, transported, to, downtown, LA., I, can’t, really, explain, it., Point, is,, I, love, this, song, in, all, of, its, melodramatic, young, person, glory., Love, it.,

to, a, lot, more, music, than, I, have, been,, but, the, simple, truth, is, that, I, haven’t, heard, anything, as, great, as, St., Lenox, in, a, long,, long, time. St., Lenox–whose, alter, ego, is, award-winning, violinist, Andy, Choi–has, put, out, a, record, that, I, cannot, stop, listening, to., The, fact, that, it’s, a, debut, makes, it, all, the, more, impressive., 10, Songs, About, Memory, and, Hope, came, out, on, January, 20,, and, it’s great., Choi, sounds, like, some, kind, of, Rufus, Wainwright-Adele, love, child,, and, his, larger-than-life, vocals, are, the, perfect, foil, for, his, songs’, minimal, arrangements., And, those, songs–hoo, boy., John, Darnielle, said, it, best:, “feeling, really, evangelical, about, just, how, good, a, lyricist, Andy, Choi, is., real, vision,
