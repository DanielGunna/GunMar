companies, and, external, organizations, about, media, related, aspects, of, the, web, platform,, to, track, on-going, works, at, W3C, and, elsewhere,, and, to, dispatch, media, work, items, to, the, appropriate, group(s), at, W3C., More, info, Second, Screen, Working, Group, The, goal, of, this, WG, is, to, define, APIs, that, enable, web, pages, to, use, secondary, screens, to, display, web, content., The, WG, develops, the, Presentation, API, and, the, Remote, Playback, API., These, APIs, are, agnostic, of, the, discovery,, authentication,, pairing, and, communication, protocols, used, under, the, hood., The, companion, Second, Screen, Community, Group, discusses, specifications, of, an, Open, Screen, Protocol, to, improve, interoperability, between, devices., More, info, TV, Control, Working, Group, The, goal, of, this, WG, is, to, define, an, API, layer, that, is, agnostic, of, any, underlying, video, sourcing, technologies, to, enable, a, web-based, application, to, provide, EPG, information,, control, and, switch, the, TV, sourcing, based, on, channel, identifier, from, EPG, data,, and, interact, with, the, TV, platform,, etc., More, info, Skip, W3C, », TV, and, Media, Activity, TV, and, Media, Activity, The, Open, Web, Platform, is, Transforming, Television, The, Open, Web, Platform, offers, tremendous, potential, as, the, driver, behind, the,

creation, of, the, Web, and, TV, Interest, Group,, W3C, has, brought, stakeholders, together, to, not, just, face, these, challenges, but, to, help, set, the, direction, in, which, technological, progress, is, made., The, expertise, of, the, members, has, resulted, in, requirements, that, have, been, adopted, by, the, relevant, Working, Groups., This, has, led, to, innovative, enhancements, to, the, specifications, that, browser, vendors, and, other, Web, implementors, rely, on,, including:, HTML5, adaptive, streaming:, proposed, and, contributed, to, enabling, adaptive, streaming, for, HTML5, video,, resulting, in, the, Media, Source, Extensions, (MSE), standard., Protected, content:, proposed, and, contributed, to, enabling, the, delivery, of, protected, content, on, the, Web,, resulting, in, the, Encrypted, Media, Extensions, (EME), specification., TV, tuner, control, in, HTML5:, Incubated, the, TV, Control, API, specification, and, helped, transition, that, work, to, the, standardization, track., Emmy, award, winning, Captioning, for, the, Web:, Continuously, improved, captioning, support, on, the, Web, through, work, on, the, Timed, Text, Markup, Language, (TTML), specification., This, work, received, an, Emmy, ®, Award, in, 2016., Home, networking:, Explored, network, service, discovery, scenarios, and, helped, related, work, in, Second, Screen, WG, on, the, Presentation, API, specification., HDR:, Raised, need, to, extend, color, support, on, the, Web, to, take, advantage, of, High-Dynamic, Range, (HDR), media, content, and, Wide, gamut, color, space.,

the, Open, Web?, The, Web, Media, API, Community, Group,, initiated, by, the, CTA, WAVE, project,, develops, such, a, baseline., Audio, support, Media, elements, in, HTML5, and, the, Web, Audio, API, enable, audio, processing, and, rendering, on, the, Web., They, need, to, be, extended, e.g., to, address, advanced, spatialization, scenarios,, in, particular, with, the, advent, of, Head, Mounted, Displays, used, in, Virtual, Reality., The, Audio, Working, Group, discusses, version, 2.0, of, the, Web, Audio, API., Hybrid, media, delivery, support, Users, now, want, to, mix, traditional,

tuners, to, applications., Second, screen, support, The, Presentation, API, and, the, Remote, Playback, API, expose, second, screens, to, web, applications, but, interoperability, between, screens, can, only, be, achieved, provided, the, industry, agrees, on, a, common, set, of, protocols, for, second, screen, support., The, Second, Screen, Community, Group, discusses, such, an, Open, Screen, Protocol., HDR, /, Wide, gamut, color, space, support, As, HDR, devices, become, widespread,, the, Web, platform, needs, to, allow, use, of, extended, color, spaces, across, the, board, (in, CSS,,
