mentions, that, Rossellini, once, said,, "from, a, very, humble, position, you, can, revise, the, whole, conception, of, the, universe.", I, think, one, could, even, go, further,, and, claim, that, one, can, change, the, conception, of, the, universe, only, through, a, humble, position., In, his, interview, with, Michael, Guarneri, for, La, Furia, Umana, (one, of, the, best, film, journals, around),, Wang, Bing, says:, 'In, my, view,, the, most, important, thing, to, keep, in, mind, is, that, a, film, is, not, a, still, image., Beauty, in, cinema, is, not, something, that, you, can, stop, and, "immortalize";, it, is, not, something, forever, frozen, into, one, single, exposure., Beauty, in, cinema, is, the, perception, of, an, ongoing, process., As, a, filmmaker,, I, am, interested, in, movement,, in, moving, images,, in, the, "evolution", of, the, real, that, is, so, difficult, to, capture, and, make, visible.', No, doubt,, his, 'Til, Madness, Do, Us, Part, is, a, case, in, point., It's, hard, to, find, beauty, in, a, Wang, Bing, film,, unless, you, start, to, accept,, and, work, (as, an, active, participant), with, their, limitations., One, floor, in, a, mental, hospital,, the, walls,, the, bars,, a, camera, with, a, slightly, wide, lens,, slightly, rounding, everything., The, camera, shakes,, sometimes, it's, dirty,, sometimes, contre-jour,, emphasizing, the, dirt., But, it, doesn't, matter,, almost,, since, the, cameraperson, (or, the, editor), doesn't, seem, to, care,, there, are, higher, stakes., And, then,, the, form,, seemingly, unimportant,, helped, by, the, editing, which, does, not, rest, on, a, specific, narrative,, or, an, identifiable, thread,, allows, an, openness, where, everything, becomes, of, equal, value,, all, elevated., Camera, is, a, tool, which, records, a, shape, of, the, reality., Through, editing, one, can, go, beyond, the, real,, let, it, evolve, like, Bing, says,, make, the, invisible, visible., Even, the, mediocre, music, coming, from, the, television, can, become, ominous., And, then,, when, the, camera, leaves, the, place,, it's, both, liberating,, for, the, eye, and, the, mind, (especially, that, shot, with, the, mountain, far, behind),, but, one, also, sees, that, there's, no, difference., In, 'Til, Madness, Do, Us, Part,, before, we, left, the, hospital,, we, have, already, learned,, to, quote, William, Blake,, "To, see, a, World, in, a, Grain, of, Sand, /, And, a, Heaven, in, a, Wild, Flower,, /, Hold, Infinity, in, the, palm, of, your, hand, /, And, Eternity,

had, never, heard, of,, I, thought, Fred, must, be, kidding..., He, was, just, trying, to, be, eccentric, or, something..., A, few, years, later,, Fred, projected, five, or, six, films, of, Breer's, to, me, in, Chicago., My, first, reaction, was, 'IMPOSSIBLE!'., These, films, were, not, humanly, probable..., I, remember, being, unarmed, by, 69,, and, then, lost, watching, 77., I, don't, remember,

New, York,, I, was, working, at, the, Film-makers', Cooperative, (co-founded, by, Breer, in, the, 70's),, where, part, of, my, job, was, inspecting, films,, frame, by, frame., I, was, happy,, happy,, whenever, I, had, to, inspect, a, film, by, Breer,, sometimes, taking, my, time, to, do, it, very, slowly,, inhaling, genius., One, day,, I, was, working, at, the, Coop,, alone, in, the, office., The,

to, say, how, much, I, love, your, films,, how, can, I, help, you?, etc., This, was, my, first,, and, only, contact, with, him., He, is, still, one, of, my, two, favorite, film-makers,, along, with, Rossellini., That, same, day,, I, started, writing, a, letter, to, him,, but, it, didn't, feel, strong, enough,, so, I, never, sent, it., Now,, I, feel, extremely, disappointed, with, myself, for, not, having, the, courage, to, share, it, with, him, at, the, time., I'm, pasting, it, below,, without, any, corrections:, Dear, Robert, Breer,, After, talking, to, you, on, the, phone, today,, I, felt, very, bad, since, there, was, so, much, more, that, I, could, have, and, should, have, told, you., It, was, such, a, great, pleasure, to, talk, to, someone, who, is, a, real, hero,, someone, who, means, much, more, to, me, than, most, other, things, in, the, world., When, I, first, saw, “69”,, the, first, film, of, yours, I, ever, saw,, my, first, reaction, was:, “IMPOSSIBLE,, how, can, a, human, being, have, such, sensitivity?”., After, seeing, many, other, films, of, yours,, and, having, had, the, chance, to, look, at, many, of, them, frame, by, frame, at, the, Coop,, I, still, believe, that, is, completely, true., Your, films, are, beyond, human, consciousness., In, my, website,, I, make, comments, about, every, filmmaker, I, like, or, love,, but, about, you, I, only, wrote, the, following:, “Robert, Breer, might, be, my, favorite, filmmaker,, I, seriously, lack, the, words, to, describe, his, work”, THAT, is, very, true,, because, your, work,, more, than, anybody, else’s,, are, so, cinematic,, so, much, tied, to, the, nature, of, cinema, itself,, that, it, is, senseless, to, try, to, make, sense, of, them, in, words,, or, any, other, different, kind, of, expression., They, are, complete, in, what, they, are,, they, mean, things, that, could, only, be, meant, in, cinema,, no, other, medium, could, translate, it,, and, that, is, exactly, why, they, mean, so, much., I, cannot, not, admire, the, person, behind, those, films..., I, wish, there, was, a, way, to, express, how, much, you, have, added, to, my, life,, how, much, you, improved, my, sense, of, life, and, art,, but, there, isn’t., I, know, it,, I, feel, it,, it’s, THERE, for, those, who, would, be, able, to, see, it, and, that’s, all., Unfortunately,, I, didn’t, see, any, of, your, works, other, than, film,, but, just, reading, about, them, was, overwhelming, enough., Can’t, imagine, what, it, would, be, like, to, experience, them, in, reality., Anyway,, IF, you, ever, need, anyone, to, help, you, with, making, art,, I, would, be, more, than, happy, to,, I, can’t, imagine, anything, else, more, worthwhile, to, do, with, my, time,, and, with, my, life., And, if, not,, I, hope, you, go, on, making,, creating, art,, trust, me, they, are, expanding, the, consciousness, of, those, who, really, can, see, what, there, is, in, them., You, might, be, one, of, the, greatest, people, ever, lived,, and, that, is, a, fact, you, should, keep, in, mind, at, any, given, second,, With, Love,, Yoel, Meranda, A, few, years, later,, I, attended the, Robert, Breer, Essential, Cinema, screening, at, Anthology, in, 2006., I, wrote, some, things, again, but, never, posted, anywhere., Again,, it, didn't, feel, strong, enough. Here, it, is,, edited, and, updated, for, this, post:, 'If, I, had, to, pick, one, filmmaker, to, send, his/her, films, to, outer, space,, it, would, be, Robert, Breer., Anthology, does, an, amazing, job, showing, these, films, every, year;, That, such, a, small, number, of, people, attend, is, a, tragedy., I, wish, there, was, also, a, program, of, his, later, films,, which, are, only, better., Breer's, films, reflect, the, thought-process, as, well, as, any, other, work, of, art,, and, simply, by, forcing, us, to, concentrate, on, the, tiniest,, in, terms, of, time, and, space,, they, push, the, boundaries, of, our, imagination., But, then,, what, happens, in, any, tiny, detail, is, overwhelmingly, intense,, the, thought-flight, is, unlike, anything, there, was, before, Breer,, the, scattered, rhythms, are, so, revolutionary, that, they, change, what, we, define, as, beautiful., The, surreality, of Pat's, Birthday,, the, solemn, look, on, those, faces, while, the, most, absurd, things, are, happening,, the, animals, at, the, end..., It, feels, as, if, there, is, no, rhythm, in, it,, as, if, the, person, cutting, them, is, beyond, human, consciousness,, while, also, being, perfectly, personal., What, about, the, bar, in, 69, that, enters, in, and, out, of, the, frame,, revolving,, a, joke, on, the, imagined, three-dimensionality, of, the, screen,, acknowledging, it,, using, it, to, make, rhythms,, while, showing, something, so, absurd, I, cannot, help, laughing, silently?, It, is, said, that, for, Breer, the, basic, unit, of, cinema, is, frame., But, that, would, be, underappreciating, his, real, achievement,, because, what, happens, between, the, frames, is, very, crucial, too,, so, in, some, way, he, denies, any, possibility, of, any, concept, of, 'unit', in, cinema,, his, films, prove, that, the, cinematic, time, is, continuous, if, the, filmmaker, makes, use, of, the, moments, between, the, frames., One, of, his, films, is, called, Breathing. It, does, not, show, anyone, really, breathing,, but, that, film, and, all, of, his, other, films, are, very, close, to, the, complicated, rhythms, of, breathing,, which, can, be, taken, as, a, metaphor, for, any, other, happening, in, the, universe,, which, happens, with, no, sense, of, symmetry, or, order., Robert, Breer, also, uses, the, sound, better, than, anyone, else,, his, seemingly, moody, sounds, vary, all, the, time, and, a, small, change, in, pitch, or, tone, seriously, changes, the, way, the, image, or, the, rhythm, is, conceived., Scientists, will, have, to, work, for, centuries, to, understand, how, the, images, and, sounds, are, interrelated, in, our, minds,, but, they, will, never, be, able, to, create, experiences, that, make, us, aware, of, our, weird, nervous, system, that, we, think, and, feel, with., Being, intensely, aware, is, one, of, the, points, of, Breer's, art.', Since, 2006,, I've, been, in, Istanbul,, where, I, never, had, a, chance, to, see, a, Breer, film, ON, FILM,, but, I, have, a, number, of, his, films, on, good, quality, video., Recently,, on, a, trip, to, U.K.,, I, stopped, by, in, Newcastle, to, see, the, Breer, exhibit, at, the, Baltic,, my, first, experience, of, his, floats,, and, his, paintings..., It, was, a, joy,, an, inspiration, so, great, I, didn't, even, know, what, to, do, with, it..., There, were, two, films, being, projected, on, film, at, the, exhibit:, Fuji, and, REcreation., Saw, both, more, than, 5-6, times, during, the, same, day,, never, tired, of, discovering..., I, wrote, very, little, about, Breer,, because, I, have, very, little, to, say..., His, art, speaks, too, forcefully,, moves, me, from, a, place, that's, too, deep, within., For, a, long, time,, only, thing, I, could, say, was, what, I, wrote, for, my, own, Senses, of, Cinema, top, tens, list:, 'If, frame, is, the, unit, of, cinema,, what, happens, between, frames, deserves, higher, attention.', I, elaborated, on, this, here., Although, I, try, to, imitate, Breer's, rhythms, in, all, of, my, videos,, I, made, one that, I, believe, somehow, resembles, Breer's, films,, it's, titled, moonalphabet,, but, honestly, I, don't, think, it's, good, enough, to, even, deserve, to, be, dedicated, to, Breer..., Oh, also,, there's, an, unfinished, animation, I, attempted,, completely, inspired, by, Breer., The, image, above, is, from, Breer's, 69., at, 1:25, PM,

who, was, I, not, to, listen?, It, was, a, curious, period., A, lot, of, Americans, were, feeling, the, need, for, a, little, rhetorical, hyping, to, compensate, for, the, lack, of, excitement, in, their, own, aesthetic, preperceptions., It, was, part, of, an, alleged, national, coming, of, age, and, if, Frenchman, wanted, to, extend, our, illusions, by, envisaging, an, art, of, film, that, was, not, only "lively", but, plastique,, we, were, ready, for, it,, whatever, it, might, mean, and, however, it, might, be, understood, by, an, art, industry, preoccupied, with, the, need, to, straddle,

poetic, films., These, are, not, about, getting, sucked, into, a, story, or, being, captivated, by, artist-made, abstractions., Instead, his, films, not, only, contemplate, nature, —, watching, the, clouds, or, the, tides, —, but, reflect, on, cinematic, mechanisms, as, a, metaphor, for, industrial, civilization., Can, our, machine-made, world, enhance, our, experience, of, nature?, Or, are, we, irretrievably, alienated, from, it, by, our, own, creations?', (...), 'Later, he, saw, "the, task, of, sailing, from, A, to, B,, which, you, can, only, do, by, working, with, the, winds, and, tides,, as, a, metaphor, for, a, film."', (...), 'For, Tree, (1974),, Welsby, tied, his, camera, to, a, tree, branch, during, a, strong, wind;, he'd, planned, an, 11-minute, film,, but, the, camera, malfunctioned, and, the, usable, portion, was, 4, minutes., The, wobbles, of, the, frame, as, the, branch, moves, dominate, the, movements, of, grass, and, branches, within, the, frame:, the, viewer, becomes, profoundly, aware, of, how, much, the, act, of, framing, conveys, dominance, and, control, —, though, here, the, agent, is, the, wind., In, the, 20-minute, Seven, Days, (1974), Welsby, finds, his, mature, voice,, offering, a, tour, de, force, unlike, anything, cinema, had, yet, seen., He, took, one, frame, of, a, Welsh, landscape, every, ten, seconds, for, a, week,, with, the, camera, anchored, to, the, same, spot, —, though, it, did, swivel., Placed, on, an, equatorial, mount, (used, in, astronomy, for, photos, of, stars),, it, followed, the, sun, across, the, sky., Moreover, the, camera, flipped, back, and, forth, between, two, positions, governed, by, the, sun's, visibility:, when, it, was, out,, the, camera, turned, 180, degrees, from, the, sun, (and, the, frame, includes, the, camera's, shadow, moving, across, the, land),, and, when, the, sun, was, behind, clouds,, it, pointed, straight, at, the, sun., What, might, sound, like, a, gentle, observational, film, seems, to, me, quite, violent., The, wind, roars, on, the, sound, track;, clouds, streak, by, almost, apocalyptically;, the, camera, flips, back, and, forth, for, no, obvious, reason., On, close, observation,, though,, one, can, usually, anticipate, these, changes, by, noticing, a, hint, of, sun, behind, the, clouds, or, the, land, darkening:, it's, possible, to, see, the, natural, "cause", of, each, cut, in, the, preceding, shot., This, is, a, film, that, rejects, the, long, tradition, of, landscape, painting, (and, much, subsequent, landscape, filmmaking), in, which, images, serve, as, metaphors, for, the, artist's, emotions., Instead, viewers, are, invited, to, bring, their, own, responses, to, this, enjambment, of, nature, and, the, machine., The, camera's, movement, in, Seven, Days, reveals, a, tiny, stream,, a, group, of, flowers,, some, distant, ridges., This, is, not, a, landscaped garden, but, a, random, assemblage, of, natural, objects, with, an, unordered, beauty,, a, beauty, the, viewer, must, discover., (Welsby, counts, John, Cage, as, another, influence.), The, film's, rough, edges, and, jittery,, speeded-up, rhythms, seem, calculated, to, express, both, the, protean, side, of, nature, (the, changing, weather, is, apparent, not, only, in, clouds, but, in, raindrops, on, the, Plexiglas, Welsby placed, in, front, of, the, lens, to, protect, it), and, the, violent,, mechanical, motion, of, the, mechanized, tripod., Just, as, sailing, involves, learning, to, work, with, the, tides, and, the, wind,, the, mechanisms, of, filmmaking, can, be, brought, into, sync, with, nature's, forces., Ethics, and, aesthetics, come, together, here,, as, Welsby, suggests, that, filmmakers, let, the, clouds, do, a, little, editing.', The, image, is, from, Welsby's, film,

"Rossellini's, films,, at, their, best,, occur, in, this, saturated,, voluptuous, present, tense, in, which, everything, is, always, on, the, point, of, transforming, itself., And, as, such,, they, grab, us, here, and, now,, in, our, present, tense, of, viewing,, no, matter, our, socio-political, or, historical, context., The, "miracles", that, Rossellini, shows, are, scarcely, mystical, (he, refused, to, include, the, depiction, of, miracles, in, Acts, of, the, Apostles),, and, the, "grace", they, bestow, is, not, exactly, in, the, hands, of, a, God, who, alights, when, and, where, he, wills, it, (which, is, the, kind, of, line, critics, like, to, lazily, indulge, in, relation, to, other, religious, cinéastes,, like, Bresson,, von, Trier, or, Dreyer)., We, can, hardly, know, -, and, the, characters, seem, to, hardly, know, -, when, the, miracle, has, actually, occurred, in, Voyage, in, Italy, or, Stromboli,, let, alone, be, able, to, instantly, comprehend, or, absorb, its, dimensions,, implications, and, consequences., Maybe, this, is, the, authentically, Rossellinian, aspect, of, some, great,, contemporary, films:, when, they, build, to, that, strange,, mysterious, instant, which, leaves, both, the, characters, and, us, stunned,, reeling, -, transformed, but, not, yet, able, to, articulate, the, structure, and, sense, of, that, transformation., It, is, enough, to, live, this, miracle,, however, confusedly,, enough, to, feel, the, power, of, the, wave,, to, know, at, last, that, you,, and, the, world, around, you,, has, begun, to, change., Rossellini's, cinema, is, about, the, moment, of, revitalisation,, on, every, conceivable, level,, personal, as, well, as, social., That, moment, of, potential, rebirth, -, and, the, need, for, it, -, will, never,
