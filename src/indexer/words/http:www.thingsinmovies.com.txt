[Things, in, Movies, Scenes,, characters,, props,, and, other, details, from, films., about, Alfred, Hitchcock, (and, Jimmy, Stewart?), Cameos, in, Dial, M, for, Murder , Wednesday,, 17th, October, 2012, 2, Comments, Dial, M, for, Murder, (1954), Tweet, Fans, of, Alfred, Hitchcock, will, know, where, he, makes, his, trademark, director’s, cameo, in, Dial, M, for, Murder, (1954),, appearing, in, the, photograph, taken, at, Tony, Wendice’s, class, reunion, dinner., But, there, may, be, another,, more, obscure, cameo, in, this, picture:, the, man, sitting, across, the, table, from, the, director, looks, remarkably, like, Jimmy, Stewart,, who, starred, with, Grace, Kelly, in, Hitchcock’s, other, 1954, film,, Rear, Window., It, may, be, Ray, Milland,, who, plays, Tony, Wendice,, as, the, two, actors, do, sometimes, look, similar,, but, the, man, in, the, photograph, parts, his, hair, on, the, right, (like, Jimmy, Stewart),, while, Milland, usually, parted, his, on, the, left., Judging, by, the, white, aura, around, the, figure,, he, also, seems, to, have, been, added, later, as, a, cutout., (Perhaps, by, the, same, person, who, got, a, bit, too, enthusiastic, when, touching, up, Charles, Swann’s, cigar,, just, to, make, absolutely, sure, the, viewer, could, see, it.), We’re, pretty, convinced, it’s, Jimmy, Stewart,, but, until, we, know, for, sure,, we’re, filing, this, under, ‘unconfirmed, rumour’., The, Newspaper, in, The, Twilight, Zone:, Time, Enough, at, Last , Friday,, 18th, November, 2011, No, Comments, The, Twilight, Zone:, Time, Enough, at, Last, (1959), Tweet, When, bank, teller, Henry, Bemis, goes, down, to, the, bank, vault, for, some, peaceful, reading, in, this, Twilight, Zone, classic, episode, ‘Time, Enough, at, Last’,, he, takes, with, him, a, newspaper, that, gives, us, a, good, quick, explanation, of, what’s, about, to, go, seriously, wrong, with, the, world., The, headline, reads, H-Bomb, Capable, of, Total, Destruction., Not, much, might, survive, the, subsequent, apocalypse,, but, the, newspaper, itself, shows, up, again,, four, episodes, later,, in, ‘What, You, Need’., In, this, case,, it’s, the, violent, loser, Renard, who, has, the, paper, brought, to, him,, hoping, to, use, a, mysterious, fountain, pen, to, divine, the, winners, of, the, listed, races., The, recurrence, of, the, newspaper, might, be, an, in-joke, by, the, programme’s, makers,, or, just, a, handy, reuse, of, a, prop., As, the, latter, episode, continues, into, the, evening,, however,, there’s, no, chance, that, the, two, episodes, take, place, on, the, same, day., (Unless, Bemis, is, still, carrying, yesterday’s, paper…), Singing, the, Internationale, in, Doctor, Zhivago , Friday,, 11th, November, 2011, One, Comment, Doctor, Zhivago, (1965), Tweet, The, incident, with, Lili, Muráti, and, the, train, wasn’t, the, only, tense, moment, during, the, filming, of, Doctor, Zhivago., Much, of, the, film, was, shot, in, Spain,, with, the, streets, of, Madrid, redressed, to, become, Moscow., So, when, the, crowds, of, Spanish, extras, march, through, the, streets, singing, the, communist, Internationale,, they, had, good, reason:, they, were, living, under, the, dictator, Francisco, Franco., The, secret, police, took, a, dim, view, of, all, this, revolutionary, singing, and, kept, a, close, eye, on, the, extras,, while, apparently, some, local, residents, also, misunderstood, the, singing,, and, toasted, the, revolution., Erik, and, Spangle, in, A, Matter, of, Life, and, Death , Thursday,, 10th, November, 2011, No, Comments, A, Matter, of, Life, and, Death, (1946), Tweet, Michael, Powell’s, two, cocker, spaniels, made, canine, cameo, appearances, in, four, of, the, Powell, &, Pressburger, films., They, turn, up, in, Contraband,, The, Life, and, Death, of, Colonel, Blimp,, and, I, Know, Where, I’m, Going!, Their, last, appearance, is, in, Dr, Reeves’, camera, obscura, in, 1946’s, A, Matter, of, Life, and, Death., The, following, letter, regarding, the, dogs’, acting, careers, appeared, in, David, McGillivray’s, ‘Now, You, Know’, column, in, the, magazine, Films, and, Filming, (June, 1983),, as, a, response, to, a, reader, enquiry:, My, thanks, to, Michael, Powell, for, passing, on, to, me, the, following, communication., “Our, names, are, Erik, and, Spangle, and, your, letter, has, been, dropped, in, on, our, celestial, kennel, by, a, passing, astronaut., Our, dear, owner, on, earth, was, Mr, Michael, Powell,, who, had, something, to, do, with, films, –, we, never, found, exactly, what., Erik, is, named, for, Erik, the, Red, and, Spangle’s, name, comes, from, a, film, in, which, Wallace, Beery, says, to, Jean, Harlow, ‘I, don’t, like, all, those, spangles, on, your, dress’,, a, remark, which, prompts, Robert, Benchley’s, ‘I, had, a, spangle, once,, a, cocker, spangle’., Mr, Pressburger, wrote, us, into, the, scripts, of, the, films, you, mention,, but, the, camera, obscura, scene, was, our, own, idea., P.S., If, you, see, Colonel, Blimp, again,, watch, when, we, arrive, in, the, house, in, London, Square., Erik, was, so, excited, that, he, cocked, his, leg, on, a, piece, of, Chippendale., (The, film, referred, to, is, probably, China, Seas,, which, featured, all, three, actors, and, was, released, in, 1935,, so, about, the, right, time, to, have, inspired, the, name, of, a, thespian, dog, working, in, the, early, forties.), Ethel,, the, Moving, Staircase, in, A, Matter, of, Life, and, Death , Wednesday,, 9th, November, 2011, No, Comments, A, Matter, of, Life, and, Death, (1946), Tweet, The, great, celestial, escalator, leading, up, to, heaven, in, A, Matter, of, Life, and, Death, is, one, of, the, film’s, most, enduring, images,, referenced, in, everything, from, architecture, to, pop, videos, (‘Go, West’, by, Pet, Shop, Boys, and, Pulp’s, ‘Help, the, Aged’, both, feature, clear, references, to, it)., Radio, adaptations, of, the, story, even, took, the, title, ‘Stairway, to, Heaven’., The, escalator, itself, was, made, by, Rowson, and, Clydesdale, for, the, production,, at, a, cost, of, £3,000, (in, 1946, money)., It, featured, 106, steps,, each, 20, feet, wide,, and, was, powered, by, a, 12hp, motor., The, engineers, who, built, it, nicknamed, it, ‘Ethel’., Older, Posts, », Latest, Things, Alfred, Hitchcock, (and, Jimmy, Stewart?), Cameos, in,
