I've, been, following, Goot's, music, for, a, couple, months, now,, and, I, want, to, start, off, by, saying, that, Goot, is, the, greatest, one, man, band, I, have, ever, heard., His, name, is, Alex, Gooter,, and, he, started, "Goot", in, 2004, at, the, young, age, of, 16., Now,, at, the, age, of, 19,, he, has, just, announced, the, release, of, his, newest, album,, entitled, "Asleep, at, the, Wheel",, which, can, be, pre-ordered, at, his, website, for, only, $8., Here's, another, thing, I, would, like, to, bring, up., A, few, of, my, friends, have, said, that, they, don't, like, Goot, because, his, band, name, is, "Goot,", which, is, about, the, most, ridiculous, statement, I've, ever, heard, in, my, life., If, you, can't, respect, this, man, for, his, extraordinary, talent,, then, there, is, something, wrong, with, you, because, "The, Red, Jumpsuit, Apparatus", is, no, better, of, a, name, than, "Goot.", Goot, at, least, resembles, his, heritage, and, represents, his, nickname,, while, "The, Red, Jumpsuit, Apparatus", makes, no, sense, at, all., So, I, guess, what, I'm, saying, is:, This, man, has, more, talent, than, most, musicians, out, there,, and, he's, making, music, that, thousands, of, people, like,, so, show, a, little, respect, and, give, him, some, credit, because, he's, an, amazing, musician., You're, only, 19, years, old, man,, so, keep, the,

into, a, room, full, of, about, a, thousand, or, more, people, similar, to, me., Not, so, much, similar, in, appearance,, but, similar, in, taste, of, music., We, were, all, waiting, for, Nintendo, Fusion, 2006, to, begin,, as, The, Sleeping, was, ready, to, kick, it, off., The, Sleeping, isn't, really, my, style, of, music,, but, I'll, still, give, them, credit, for, their, great, talent., Plain, White, T's, Next, in, line, was, Plain, White, T's., I, saw, them, at, Warped, Tour, this, year, as, well,, and, they, had, a, great, show., Their, instrumentals, are, great,, and, their, singer,, Tom,, is, an, amazing, singer., If, you, were, to, compare, his, voice, from, their, album, and, from, one, of, their, live, shows,, you, could, barely, tell, a, difference., That's, when, you, know, how, good, a, singer's, vocals, really, are., Emery, Emery, was, the, next, band, to, hit, the, stage., They, were, pretty, decent,, but, I, only, listened, to, a, few, songs, because, I, was, busy, getting, autographs, and, talking, to, the, Plain, White, T's, band, members., I, categorize, Emery, in, the, same, column, as, The, Sleeping, -, A, great, band, with, alot, of, talent,, but, just, not, my, style., Relient, K, As, the, interval, from, the, end, of, Emery's, show, to, the, next, band, ended,, the, crowd, listened, closely, and, watched, as, Relient, K, came, out, to, the, Super, Mario, theme, song,, and, they, even, did, their, own, little, hop, to, match, the, hopping, noise, in, the, Super, Mario, theme, song., A, pretty, clever, idea, if, I, do, say, so, myself., It, was, a, great, way, to, start, off, their, show., Matthew's, piano, skills, and, vocals, sounded, amazing,, all, the, instrumentals, sounded, good,, and, it, turned, out, to, be, a, rockin', performance., They, played, a, couple, brand, new, songs,, and, they, sounded, pretty, amazing., Their, new, album, comes, out, March, 6,, 2007., Hawthorne, Heights, Finally,, the, band, that, everybody, wanted, to, see, the, most, -, Hawthorne, Heights., I, personally, like, Relient, K, more, than, Hawthorne, Heights,, but, Hawthorne, Heights, had, a, pretty, amazing, live, performance., Their, lead, guitarist, is, amazing., Not, only, does, he, play, lead;, he, also, does, all, the, screaming., Most, bands, would, need, two, people, to, fill, those, two, roles(Underoath,, for, example),, but, this, guy, is, just, that, good., He, plays, an, amazing, lead,, and, his, screaming, actually, has, meaning, and, sounds, good., As, for, the, band, as, a, whole,, they, sounded, pretty, good,, and, I, ended, up, buying, their, newest, album, (If, Only, You, Were, Lonely), for, only, $5., I, thought, this, was, a, pretty, fair, deal,, so, I, now, own, Hawthorne, Heights's, new, album., They, played, a, great, show,, and, they, got, the, job, done., Nintendo, Fusion, 2006, was, a, great, experience,, and, though, it, was, not, as, good, as, Warped, Tour,, I, had, a, great, time, and, I, enjoyed, watching, every, performance,, getting, autographs,, and, buying, souvenirs., To, say, the, least,, it, was, an, experience, I, won't, ever, forget.,

I've, been, out, here, since, May, 8th, mixing, our, new, album., Mixing, is, a, bizarre, ritual, that, is, the, last, step, of, making, an, album., A, band, spends, months, writing, and, rehearsing, songs, for, an, album., Then, you, go, into, a, studio, and, spend, a, few, more, months, recording, it, and, listening, to, it, under, a, microscope., Then, after, that,, you, mix, it, all, in, just, 12, days!!!!!!, Mixing, is, kind, of, like, editing, a, movie., You, shoot, a, bunch, of, film,, then, you, take, it, to, a, person, who, helps, you, piece, it, all, together., You, can, only, hope, that, the, person, you've, hired, to, mix, your, album, (or, edit, your, film), shares, a, similar, vision, or, takes, your, vision, to, a, higher, level., The, person, mixing, our, new, record, is, a, guy, named, Tom, Lord, Alge., He, mixed, five, songs, off, our, last, record,, "Palm, Trees, and, Power, Lines",, that, turned, out, really, well, so, we, wanted, to, work, with, him, again., He's,

a, song, called, "Dead, Living",, which, could, end, up, being, the, first, song, on, the, album., After, we, finish, mixing, the, whole, album...I'll, head, back, to, LA., We're, gonna, shoot, a, new, video, in, June.....and, then, we'll, start, rehearsing, for, a, new, tour, that, we're, putting, together, for, Sept/Oct., We, haven't, announced, dates, yet, or, what, bands, are, gonna, open,

our, first, record;, it's, been, a, long, time, coming, so, we're, excited, to, get, into, it, with, him., We, want, this, record, to, take, us, places, musically, that, we, haven't, gone, before,, we, are, ready, to, pour, our, hearts, and, souls, into, it, and, make, it, the, best, Sugarcult, record, ever,, which, is, also, why, we, are, taking, our, time., The, past, few, months, have, been,
