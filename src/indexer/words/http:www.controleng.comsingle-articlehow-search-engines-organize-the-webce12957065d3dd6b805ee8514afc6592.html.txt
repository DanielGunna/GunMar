for, research, on, the, web,, you, know, that, the, lengths, of, the, lists, of, matching, web, sites, returned, after, entering, a, search, can, vary, dramatically, based, on, the, search,, and, the, search, engine, used., For, example,, if, you, enter, the, phrase, "automation", on, the, Yahoo!, search, engine,, you, get, a, list, of, 96, categories, and, 2,688, specific, sites, to, peruse., If, you, enter, the, exact, same, word, on, Excite's, site,, you, get, no, less, than, 79,254, individual, sites., The, same, search, on, Lycos', site, results, in, only, 3, categories, and, about, 100, individual, sites,, selected, by, how, closely, they, match, the, word, "automation.", How, search, engines, work, Why, such, a, difference, between, the, sites?, It, all, has, to, do, with, how, that, particular, site, chooses, to, find, and, keep, track, of, all, the, web, sites, out, there., Search, engines, do, not, search, the, entire, World, Wide, Web., That, would, be, impossible,, given, the, number, of, web, sites, in, existence, and, the, fact, that, new, sites, are, being, added, every, day., Most, search, engines, use, robots, to, go, out, onto, the, Internet, and, collect, the, URLs, and, descriptions, of, as, many, web, sites, as, possible., They, are, not, robots, in, the, true, sense, of, the, word;, rather,, they, are, computer, programs, that, are, designed, to, automatically, locate, and, index, URLs, and, the, URLs, referenced, within., Like, web, surfing, itself,, it, can, seem, like, an, endless, process,, which, is, why, it, must, be, an, automated, task., The, robots,, sometimes, called, "spiders,", then, index, the, URLs, found, into, a, database,, which, is, what, the, search, engine, will, actually, search., Since, each, different, search, engine, has, its, own, robot, program, or, programs, to, do, its, indexing,, and, each, search, engine, indexes, URLs, differently,, the, presentation, and, amount, of, subject-relevant, web, sites, that, search, engines, gather, into, their, databases, will, obviously, differ, from, search, engine, to, search, engine., That, is, not, to, say, that, any, one, search, engine, is, better, than, any, others., It, all, depends, on, how, you, prefer, your, information, organized, and, presented, to, you., Where, to, go?, Most, search, engines', robots, or, spiders, will, start, in, places, where, they, can, find, large, numbers, of, URLs, to, visit,, usually, pages, that, contain, large, amounts, of, links., From, there, they, can, explore, countless, different, avenues, and, collect, URLs, and, site, descriptions, most, efficiently., However,, since, it, is, most, certainly, the, case, that, there, will, be, sites, that, robots, can't, get, to, from, anywhere, else,, the, majority, of, search, engines, also, allow, users, to, submit, URLs, for, robots, to, visit,, usually, by, filling, out, an, online, form., These, two, methods, help, to, ensure, that, the, search, engine, has, a, diverse, collection, of, URLs, in, its, database., Each, individual, search, engine's, database, is, then, organized, into, categories, to, help, make, searching, easier., The, users, can, then, search, the, database, two, ways:, by, entering, a, specific, word, or, phrase,, or, by, browsing, the, category, or, categories, from, which, they, would, like, further, information., Virtual, libraries, Many, of, the, places, that, robots, will, start, collecting, are, classified, as, online, "virtual, libraries,", dedicated, to, specific, subjects, or, fields., Some, virtual, libraries, operate, the, exact, same, way, as, a, regular, search, engine, does,, differing, only, in, the, content, they, keep, in, their, databases., Other, virtual, libraries, simply, keep, an, online, list, of, links, to, related, web, sites, that, the, user, can, browse, and, do, not, have, a, search, option., These, virtual, libraries, can, become, valuable, tools, for, researching, a, particular, subject,, or, keeping, handy, in, a, bookmark, list, for, frequent, referencing., Most, virtual, libraries, can, be, found, through, the, larger, search, engines., Author, Information,
