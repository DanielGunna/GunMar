plot, hole, Rating:, 3, out, of, 5, <br, />, Daniel, Aronson’s, Earth, Alone:, Earthrise, Book, 1, depicts, a, dystopian, future, in, which, huge, centipede-like, aliens, regularly, try, to, invade, earth., They, have, a, handful, of, extremely, nasty, attacks,, so, people, die, en, masse, and, horribly., Because, of, this, war, all, people, are, drafted, into, military, service, for, five, years, at, the, age, of, 18., We, follow, Marco, and, his, adopted, sister, Addy, as, they, go, through, an, incredibly, punishing, basic, training.,  , The, entire, book, is, about, Marco, (who, would, rather, be, a, librarian, and, a, writer),, Addy,, the, new, people, they, meet,, and, how, they, all, (or, most), survive, basic, training., From, latrine, cleaning, to, weapons, training, it’s, all, there., 60%, of, the, world’s, population, is, gone, thanks, to, these, aliens,, and, it’s, crucial, that, the, military, turn, out, tough, troops, ready, for, what’s, ahead., I, wouldn’t, say, the, characters, are, the, most, three-dimensional, I’ve, ever, seen,, but, they, do, have, depth, to, them., It’s, just, enough, to, be, able, to, say, that, Aronson, produced, some, good, characterization,, but, not, enough, to, make, me, shed, any, tears, over, a, character’s, tragedy., Marco, tended, to, magically, find, the, best, in, everyone,, which, seemed, a, little, unlikely,, but, not, too, bad., The, basic, training,, too,, doesn’t, really, bring, anything, new, to, the, table,, but, it, still, held, my, interest., The, biggest, problem, I, have, is, this:, nukes., They’ve, already, nuked, the, alien, planet, once., The, author, explains, that, now, they’re, in, a, war, of, attrition,, but, there’s, no, reason, given, for, why, we, haven’t, just, kept, nuking, them, into, the, stone, age., This, isn’t, a, situation, where, they, have, to, worry, about, the, global, politics, of, nuking, a, neighbor., The, enemies, aren’t, humanoid,, so, there’s, no, empathy, issue, to, worry, about., This, is, a, pretty, big, plot, hole,, because, without, some, kind, of, legitimate, explanation,, the, entire, premise, of, the, book, is, cracked, open., Maybe, the, aliens, have, a, huge, fleet, that, serves, as, their, home, now, and, it’s, a, lot, harder, to, nuke, a, fleet, than, part, of, a, planet., Something, like, that., As, long, as, there, was, a, reason, that, made, sense, I’d, be, happy,, but, unless, I, missed, it,, it’s, just, a, gaping, plot, hole., I, haven’t, yet, decided, whether, I’m, going, to, read, the, next, volume., Posted, in,

No, Comments, ↓, Pros:, An, interesting, take, on, high, intelligence, Cons:, Some, of, the, hammered-in, details, weren’t, ones, I, could, agree, with, Rating:, 4, out, of, 5, <br, />, Wired, is, the, first, book, in, a, series, by, Douglas, E., Richards., In, it,, Kira,, a, biology, prodigy,, kidnaps, a, man,, David, Desh,, who’s, been, sent, in, turn, to, capture, her., She’s, learned, to, amp, up, the, power, of, the, human, brain, to, stratospheric, heights,, but, only, for, an, hour, at, a, time–and, with, some, unwanted, side, effects., Just, to, make, her, even, more, of, a, mark,, in, one, of, her, amped-up, sessions, she, developed, a, tonic, that, doubles, the, lifespan, of, a, human, being., Amped-Kira, decided, that, David, is, the, one, person, in, all, of, this, she, might, be, able, to, convince, and, to, gain, the, help, of,, while, everyone, else, just, wants, to, put, her, in, a, cage, and, harvest, her, inventions., David’s, been, told, that, she’s, a, terrorist, planning, to, kill, nearly, the, entire, species, with, a, targeted, Ebola, virus,, so, he, has, a, lot, of, reason, not, to, believe, her, side, of, the, story.,  , I, felt, the, will, he/won’t, he, of, Desh’s, loyalties, was, reasonable., Usually, such, things, go, on, way, too, long, past, the, point, where, the, person, should, understand, who, the, good, and, bad, guys, are,, but, it, just, isn’t, as, easy, this, time,, and, I, like, that., It’s, genuinely, not, as, obvious, to, him, who’s, doing, what., There, are, two, basic, side, effects, to, the, one-hour, super-intelligence, drug., First,, massive, munchies., Second,, sociopathy/extreme, selfishness., For, most, of, the, book, it’s, billed, as, an, inevitable, side, effect, of, high, intelligence,, which, I, found, off-putting., It, does, become, less, straightforward, than, that, eventually,, however., In, some, of, Richards’, other, books, I’ve, found, his, enthusiastic, dives, into, subjects, to, read, like, soapboxes., In, Wired,, it, comes, off, less, as, though, the, author, is, lecturing, to, the, reader., However,, he, still, does, enjoy, getting, into, his, subjects,, so, you, do, need, to, be, a, fan, of, more, mentally-exploratory, SF, as, opposed, to, action, SF., I, think, Wired, reads, more, professionally, than, some, of, his, books., It’s, always, good, to, see, an, author, grow, in, talent, and, skill!, While, this, is, the, more, exploratory, sort, of, SF,, that, spends, much, of, its, time, discussing, and, expanding, upon, interesting, possibilities,, there, is, action, here, and, there., David, used, to, be, Special, Ops,, and, someone, has, usurped, a, portion, of, the, military, to, send, after, David, and, Kira., There, is, a, bit, too, much, “ooooh, Kira”, love, in, here., She’s, not, only, beyond, a, genius, IQ,, she’s, beautiful, and, incredibly, charming, to, boot., It’s, weird,, though,, because, usually, when, this, happens, it’s, because, the, character, is, the, same, gender, as, the, author, and, is, acting, as, a, stand-in, for, how, the, author, wishes, he, or, she, could, be., In, this, case,, given, that, each, character, is, very, superior, in, their, own, way,, and, it, makes, sense, for, extreme, people, to, come, together, for, this,, I, think, it’s, reasonable., (And, you, won’t, hear, me, say, that, very, often!), Posted, in, Reviews, Tagged, with:, Douglas, E., Richards,, Sci-Fi,, Science, Fiction,, SF, Short, Take:, “Black, and, Blue,”, James, Patterson,, Candice, Fox, Posted, on, January, 17,, 2017, by, Heather, —, No, Comments, ↓, Pros:, Decent, detective, story, Cons:, A, lot, of, unlikable, characters, Rating:, 3, out, of, 5, <br, />, James, Patterson, and, Candice, Fox, are, the, authors, of, Black, &, Blue, (BookShots)., The, “BookShots”, indicator, means, this, is, a, novella,, a, short, book, meant, to, take, up, an, hour, or, two., I, find, it, great, for, when, I, just, need, a, little, break., In, this, case,, the, tale, involves, a, woman, who’s, trying, to, steal, a, boat,, and, the, owners, of, the, boat, who, are, on, medically, borrowed, time, if, no, one, stops, her., I, swear, it, seems, like, all, the, main, characters, (or, major, adversaries), in, crime, drama, books, are, now, from, the, foster, system., I, know, it’s, an, easy, way, to, give, them, “issues”, to, work, out,, or, ways, to, empathize, with, other, not-so-nice, people,, but, I, think, it’s, getting, out, of, hand., Pretty, much, all, of, the, characters, in, this, book, are, difficult, to, like,, which, also, seems, to, be, a, current, trend, that, might, have, gotten, out, of, hand., It’s, nice, to, see, that, Blue, does, make, mistakes,, particularly, early, on, (I, dislike, infallible, protagonists)., I, also, like, it, when, victims, find, ways, to, fight, back,, and, we, do, get, to, see, some, of, that., Guns, with, “silencers”,, however,, are, not, actually, silent., The, story, was, reasonably, good, and, I’ll, say, I, love, the, ending,, although, I, won’t, go, into, more, detail, than, that., Posted, in, Reviews, Tagged, with:, Bookshots,, Candice, Fox,, crime,

children’s, book, Cons:, Oops,, didn’t, see, that, it, was, a, children’s, book…, Rating:, 4, out, of, 5, <br, />, I, started, reading, Douglas, E., Richards’, The, Prometheus, Project:, Trapped, (Volume, 1), because, I’d, been, intrigued, by, one, or, two, of, his, other, books., This, one, sounded, interesting, as, well,, but, I, totally, failed, to, note, that, it, was, a, children’s, book., Because, of, that,, I, started, out, thinking, that, the, book, was, waaay, over-explaining, things, and, thus, being, totally, condescending, to, its, audience., I’m, not, familiar, with, most, children’s, books,, but, I, did, at, some, point, realize, maybe, I, should, check, Amazon, and, see–and, yep,, it’s, under, children’s, fiction., So, okay., I, don’t, think, it’s, being, condescending, any, more., At, any, rate,, this, is, a, story, about, two, kids,, Ryan, and, Regan–older, brother, and, younger, sister, (yes, that, should, have, tipped, me, off., Shush,, you!)., Their, family, recently, moved, to, the, middle, of, nowhere,, and, the, kids, overhear, their, parents, talking, about, top-secret, projects, and, riddle-passwords, and, things, like, that., The, kids, decide, they, have, to, figure, out, what’s, so, important, and, thus, set, about, breaking, into, their, parents’, place, of, work., Mind, you,, I’m, not, buying, it., Supposedly, the, lack, of, security, is, simply, temporary,, but, given, how, cheap, security, cameras, can, get,, I, fail, to, believe, that, a, place, surrounded, by, razorwire, and, invisible, lasers, has, yet, to, put, up, cameras, every, ten, feet, or, whatever,, and, I, also, fail, to, believe, that, it, has, so, few, security, guards., But, hey,, it’s, a, kids’, book,, and, that, isn’t, what, you, want, to, focus, on., After, getting, through, various, security, measures,, the, kids, find, their, way, into, what, seems, to, be, an, underground, alien, city,, where, they, find, all, the, scientists, celebrating, having, broken, into, said, city–until,, that, is,, a, swarm, of, big, insects, appears, and, seems, to, eat, everything, except, the, kids–equipment,, scientists,, and, all., The, kids, find, that, the, doorway, is, closed, now,, and, they’re, going, to, have, to, apply, everything, their, parents, have, taught, them, about, the, scientific, method, and, puzzle-solving, in, order, to, save, the, adults, and, make, their, way, out., As, an, adult,, I, found, chunks, of, this, book, boring, or, condescending,, with, plot, holes, included, in, a, handful, of, places., Well,, most, of, my, lack, of, enjoyment, was, caused, by, my, lack, of, awareness, of, this, being, a, children’s, book., There, are, still, some, plot, holes, here, and, there,, but, I, think, kids, are, at, least, less, likely, to, notice, them, or, be, bothered, by, them., Posted, in, Reviews, Tagged, with:, children,, Douglas, E., Richards,, Sci-Fi,, Science, Fiction,, SF,, The, Prometheus, Project,

on, John., Alex, goes, more, than, a, little, crazy, trying, to, track, down, Soneji, while, John, hovers, between, life, and, death, and, nobody, else, believes, it, could, be, Soneji., It’s, a, halfway, decent, book,, rendered, almost, entirely, unreadable, by, the, total, cliffhanger, of, an, ending., Generally, the, point, of, a, short, story/novella/”BookShot”, is, to, provide, something, you, can, relax, and, read, in, a, short, time., Ending, it, with, a, vast, hole, in, the, story, is, incredibly, annoying,, and, watching, Alex, go, crazy, over, Soneji, wasn’t, enough, to, hold, my, interest, through, the, entire, piece, of, fiction., Thus,, summary, of, story:, Alex, goes, crazy, (with, a, little, pushing),, John, might, die,, and, there’s, no, half-satisfying, ending., Posted,

of, book, short, enough, to, be, downed, in, one, quick, shot,, just, like, whiskey, (especially, in, a, season, when, everyone’s, main, character, seems, to, be, a, whiskey-based, alcoholic–except, this, one)., I, like, it, better, than, “novella”,, which, is,, I, think,, a, term, most, people, aren’t, that, familiar, with., Come, and, Get, Us, (BookShots),, by, James, Patterson, and, Shan,

enemies, that, crop, up., There, aren’t, many, characters, in, here,, but, the, authors, put, a, surprising, amount, of, personality, into, them, in, the, short, space., Miranda, and, her, enemies,

pretty, much, my, favorite, genre., Witt, does, do, a, great, job, of, developing, Izzy’s, character, and, setting, up, her, story,, but, he, takes, us, just, up, to, the, point, where, a, major, thing, will, have, to, happen, and, then, leaves, us, hanging., Since, episode, 1, was, totally, different, and, covered, totally, different, people,, I, have, little, hope, that, it’ll, pick, up, on, Izzy’s, story, next, time., I, loved, the, opening, of, this, one,, though,, because, it, delved, into, some, interesting, parasitology, aspects, (the, fact, that, some, parasites, can, basically,
