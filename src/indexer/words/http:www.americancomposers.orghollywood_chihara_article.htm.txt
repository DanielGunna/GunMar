[ , FOR, TICKETS, CALL, CarnegieCharge:, 212-247-7800, aco, homepage, concert, schedule, Program, notes, for, this, concert, Essay, Paul, Chihara, went, Hollywood, (and, Carnegie, Hall,, too),  , From, Scene, to, Shining, Screen:, A, Short, History, of, Film, Music, by, Paul, Chihara, Movie, music, was, not, born, in, the, movie, theaters, but, in, the, worlds, of, opera,, musical, theater,, and, vaudeville., Concert, music, too,, particularly, the, romantic, and, melodramatic, scores, of, the, late, nineteenth, century,, so, popular, in, the, early, twentieth,, provided, a, large, and, immediately, available, library, of, recognizable, and, memorable, material, suitable, for, film, underscoring., Mendelssohn's, Fingel's, Cave, Overture,, Wagner's, Ride, of, the, Walkurie,, Lizst's, Les, Preludes,, Rossini's, William, Tell, Overture,, just, to, mention, some, very, obvious, examples, of, dramatic, and, descriptive, music,, were, ideal, for, movie, music., When, D.W., Griffeth, produced, his, silent, Birth, of, a, Nation, (1915),, he, provided, a, large, orchestral, score, stitched, together, from, classical, and, popular, sources., THE, GOLDEN, AGE, (1933-1956), Silent, movies, were, never, silent,, and, the, early, projectors, were, always, noisy., Music, was, a, necessary, mask, and, accompaniment, to, the, enjoyment, of, the, early, films., Not, surprisingly,, the, first, composers, for, the, new, "Talking, Pictures", in, Hollywood, (beginning, in, 1926, with, Don, Juan, starring, Lionel, Barrymore, and, in, 1927, with, Al, Jolsen's, The, Jazz, Singer), were, classically, trained,, mostly, European, immigrants,, often, fleeing, Nazi, persecution., The, Golden, Age, of, Hollywood, coincided, with, the, great, era, of, American, songwriting,, with, many, of, the, same, composers., Irving, Berlin, (born, Israel, Baline, from, Minsk!),, Gershwin,, Porter,, and, Rodgers, wrote, songs, and, scores, for, musical, theater, and, movies, during, a, time, when, popular, and, classical, musical, styles, were, not, mutually, exclusive., Europe's, tragic, loss, was, America's, cultural, gain,, beginning, most, respectably, with, Wolfgang, Korngold,, that, wunderkind, from, Vienna, whose, operas, and, concert, music, were, highly, respected, and, widely, performed., Korngold, wrote, only, sixteen, movie, scores, (most, notably, Captain, Blood, in, 1935,, Robin, Hood, in, 1938,, The, Sea, Hawk, in, 1940,, and, Of, Human, Bondage, in, 1946),, but, his, influence, on, filmmakers,, studios,, and, other, composers, was, very, profound., His, scores,, with, lush, music, often, running, throughout, an, entire, scene, ("wall, to, wall", as, it, is, termed, in, the, industry), under, dialogue, and, action, alike, created, operatic, scenes, of, great, emotional, power, and, sensuousness., The, Golden, Years, of, Hollywood, were, typified, by, this, Technicolor, (visually, and, musically, speaking), style:, a, sort, of, Der, Rosenkavalier, approach, to, lavish, entertainment., Among, his, Viennese, compatriots, who, also, worked, in, Hollywood, was, (my, personal, favorite), the, immortal, Max, Steiner., Like, Korngold,, Steiner, attended, the, Academy, of, Music, in, Vienna,, was, a, friend, of, Arnold, Schoenberg, (who, also, immigrated, to, Los, Angeles),, and, enjoyed, early, success, as, a, classical, composer., But, unlike, Korngold, or, Schoenberg,, he, was, attracted, early, in, his, career, to, musical, theater, and, in, 1914, found, himself, in, New, York, working, on, Broadway., He, was, 42, (in, 1929), when, he, arrived, in, Hollywood, where, he, eventually, made, up, for, his, late, start, with, a, prodigious, output, of, some, 200, film, scores., Among, his, masterpieces, are, Gone, With, the, Wind, (1938),, The, Informer, (1935),, and, Now, Voyager, (1942)., Steiner's, music, can, be, European, (by, which, I, mean, the, heroic, vocabulary, of, the, Late, Romantic),, light, and, urbane, (Little, Women,, 1933,, or, Roberta,, 1935),, or, darkly, dramatic:, the, Wagnerian, leit, motifs, in, King, Kong, (1933),, as, well, as, the, memorable, "cowboy", music, in, The, Treasure, of, the, Sierra, Madre, (1948)., Speaking, of, cowboys,, the, musical, vocabulary, of, the, All-American, Western, was, created, by, ex-patriot, Europeans,, usually, Russian, or, Polish, and, often, Jewish,, who, carried, the, spirit, of, Rimsky-Korsakov,, Glazunov, and, Prokofiev, (not, to, mention, Klezmer, and, Yiddish, folk, music), into, the, scenes, of, wide-open, spaces, and, heroic, action., Aaron, Copland, comes, immediately, to, mind,, although, he, only, wrote, six, commercial, feature, films,, one, of, which, is, an, American, classic, in, the, concert, world, (The, Red, Pony,, 1949),, and, another, which, won, him, an, Oscar, (The, Heiress,, 1949)., And, what, could, be, more, Western, or, American, sounding, than, the, title, song, for, High, Noon, (1952),, or, the, themes, from, Giant, (1956), or, Friendly, Persuasion, (1956),, both, composed, by, Dmitri, Tiomkin,, who, was, born, in, St., Petersburg, and, educated, there, in, classical, music, at, the, Conservatory, of, Music?, Compare, the, Main, Title, music, of, Giant, with, Alexander, Nevsky, (Prokofiev), and, the, similarities, in, harmonic, progression, and, melodic, shape, (as, well, as, orchestration,, including, a, large, chorus), are, immediately, apparent., Among, other, European, trained, musicians, were, Miklos, Rozsa,, Franz, Waxman,, Ernest, Gold,, Alex, North, (born, in, Pennsylvania,, educated, at, Curtis, and, in, Moscow,, and, a, great, admirer, of, Prokofiev's),, and, Victor, Young, (who, though, born, in, Chicago, was, raised, and, educated, in, Poland)., Young, composed, the, haunting, score, for, the, supernatural, thriller, The, Uninvited,, whose, main, theme, became, the, ever, popular, standard, Stella, by, Starlight., These, European, composers, joined, the, thriving, and, growing, colony, of, American, composers., These, would, include, Bernard, Herrmann,, Hugo, Friedhofer,, David, Raksin, (who, studied, with, Arnold, Schoenberg, and, later, composed, the, wonderful, score, for, Laura),, and, Al, Newman, (whose, theme, for, Street, Scene, became, the, prototype, for, all, film, noir, melodies)., Their, younger, colleagues,, now, the, old, guard, of, the, "legit", movie, score,, would, include, John, Williams,, who, not, only, composed, the, most, famous, Wagnerian, scores, in, the, history, of, movie, music, (Star, Wars),, but, the, heart-rending, Schindler's, List, as, well,, Elmer, Bernstein, (whose, themes, for, Magnificent, Seven, and, To, Kill, a, Mockingbird, in, 1963, established, enduring, musical, models),, and, the, versatile, Jerry, Goldsmith, (whose, scores, for, Chinatown, and, Patton, are, among, the, modern, classics, of, the, genre)., Leonard, Rosenmann, studied, with, Roger, Sessions, and, created, the, classic, East, of, Eden, score, (with, its, unforgettable, melody, and, it, subsequent, musical, development, in, a, style, worthy, of, Wozzeck),, before, he, went, on, to, win, two, academy, awards., TELEVISION, AND, THE, EARLY, SIXTIES, From, the, world, of, television, came, a, young, lion, in, the, late, fifties,, which, revolutionized, and, totally, Americanized, Hollywood's, concept, of, underscoring., In, 1959,, a, young, jazz, pianist, named, Henry, Mancini, created, a, score, for, a, TV, series, Peter, Gunn, with, a, distinctly, Stan, Kenton/Pete, Ruggulo, sound., A, wonderfully, talented, composer, of, upbeat, melodies, with, contemporary, rhythms, and, imaginative, instrumentation,, Mancini, won, the, Oscar, for, Breakfast, at, Tiffany's, (and, the, song, Moon, River),, and, composed, the, catchy, melodies, (with, ubiquitous, Saxophone), for, The, Pink, Panther., Another, revolution, in, film, music,, introducing, the, analogue, synthesizer, in, place, of, the, orchestra,, was, heralded, by, Vangelis, in, Chariots, of, Fire, (1981),, and, he, was, soon, followed, by, others, such, as, Harold, Faltemeyer, (Beverly, Hills, Cop),, and, presently, by, Hans, Zimmer,, whose, large, orchestral, scores, are, transformed, by, computer, techniques, and, complex, sampled, sounds., NEO-REALISM,, NOUVELLE, VAGUE, AND, ENGLAND, The, influence, of, European, cinema, after, the, Second, World, War,, particularly, from, Italy, (Neorealism), and, France, (Nouvelle, Vague),, eventually, had, a, profound, effect, on, Hollywood, movies, and, their, underscores., At, first, in, New, York, City, where, writers,, directors, and, theater, actors, were, hard, at, work, on, live, television, (during, its, so-called, Golden, Years),, a, new, attitude, towards, underscore, began, to, emerge., A, sort, of, musical, realism, (an, oxymoron?), where, spare, orchestration,, far, less, music,, more, emphasis, on, period, Source, Music, (music, which, is, visible, on, screen),, and, an, avoidance, of, the, clichés, of, the, Forties,, became, the, rule., With, Truffault, came, George, Delarue,, but, with, De, Sica, (The, Bicycle, Thief,, 1948), or, Ingmar, Bergman, came, no, prominent, composer., Suddenly, movies, were, silent, again,, but, the, cinematic, void, was, soon, filled, with, American, composers, writing, in, their, own, colorful, vernacular,, with, firm, grounding, in, the, classical, compositional, techniques, of, former, times,, but, embracing, all, the, idiomatic, styles, of, down-home, Americana., Alex, North's, A, Streetcar, Named, Desire, (1951),, besides, being, a, great, score, for, a, great, movie, (and, play,, ballet, and, eventually, opera, by, Andre, Previn),, was, also, one, of, the, first, major, Hollywood, scores, to, be, derived, from, New, Orleans, Dixieland, and, Jazz., European, composers, would, again, assert, their, hypnotic, power, and, influence, in, the, very, operatic, scores, by, Ennio, Morricone, who,, ironically,, came, to, our, attention, during, the, early, Sixties, with, his, creative, and, bizarre, scores, for, Italian, "Spaghetti", Westerns, by, Sergio, Leone, (For, a, Fistful, of, Dollars,, 1964)., Thus,, the, ultimate, transformation, wherein, Europe, imitates, Hollywood,, and, in, certain, respects, surpasses, it., (French, film, critics, have, often, cited, Jazz,, Westerns,, and, film, noir,, as, the, three, significant, American, contributions, to, World, Culture!), Tony, Richardson's, brilliant, Tom, Jones, (1963), was, enhanced, immeasurably, by, the, witty, and, neoclassic, score, by, John, Addison,, and, with, David, Lean's, epic, Lawrence, of, Arabia,, a, young, percussionist, and, classically, trained, composer,, Maurice, Jarre,, made, his, spectacular, entrance, on, the, cinematic, world., The, Umbrellas, of, Cherbourg, (1964), introduced, Michel, Legrande, to, American, audiences,, and, with, Fellini, and, Zefferelli, came, the, wonderfully, operatic, (and, circus-influenced), Nina, Rota,, whose, score, for, Coppola's, Godfather, is, one, of, the, great, achievements, in, the, history, of, movie, music., These, composers, influenced, American, music,, and, were, themselves, influenced, by, it,, creating, an, international, style, of, movie, music, at, times, enriched, and, at, others, clichéd., But, almost, always, designed, to, give, pleasure, and, emotional, catharsis., JAZZ,, POP,, AND, MTV, That, most, American, of, musical, styles,, Jazz,, has, contributed, some, noteworthy, scores, by, the, most, distinguished, of, musicians:, Duke, Ellington, (Anatomy, of, Murder,, 1959),, Miles, Davis,, Dave, Brubeck,, Herbie, Hancock,, Dave, Grusin,, Randy, Newman,, and, Tom, Scott, are, among, the, most, important., Perhaps, the, most, successful, use, of, Jazz, in, a, memorable, movie, was, Quincy, Jones', first, movie, score, The, Pawnbroker, (1965),, directed, by, Sidney, Lumet., The, influence, of, popular, music, from, the, era, of, the, Great, American, Songbook, made, its, powerful, impression, from, the, very, inception, of, sound, movies, (The, Jazz, Singer,, 1927),, and, in, this, day, of, MTV, and, universal, advertising,, the, Pop, Cultures, of, Rap,, Reggae,, Rock,, Latin,, and, Country, Western,, sometimes, in, grotesque, fusion, with, sampled, orchestral, montages,, assault, audiences, in, decibels, approaching, the, painful., Contemporary, movie, scores, (where, the, Music, Supervisor, gets, screen, credit, precedence, over, the, composer!), is, very, big, business,, and, closely, allied, to, the, worlds, of, television, and, recordings., CLASSICAL, COMPOSERS, IN, FILM, MUSIC, TODAY, In, the, second, century, of, the, history, of, movies,, and, at, the, dawn, of, the, Third, Millennium,, music, in, the, movies, is, now, a, legitimate, subject, of, study, at, respected, universities., Films, are, no, longer, a, "guilty, pleasure", (well,, not, always!),, and, the, scores, that, accompany, them, are, often, contributed, by, serious, concert, composers., (Maurice, Ravel, once, remarked, that, he, wanted, Walt, Disney, to, create, a, film, on, his, opera, L'Enfant, et, les, Sortileges)., Saint, Saens,, Jacques, Ibert,, Prokofiev,, Shostakovitch,, Benjamin, Britten,, William, Walton,, Kurt, Weill,, Georges, Auric,, Stravinsky,, Schoenberg,, Aaron, Copland, and, Leonard, Bernstein, (On, the, Waterfront,, 1954), were, among, the, first, serious, composers, to, write, film, scores., Among, contemporary, composers,, Toru, Takemitsu,, Peter, Maxwell, Davies,, Andre, Previn,, Elliott, Goldenthal,, Alfred, Schnittke,, Leonard, Rosenman,, John, Corigliano,, Steven, Sondheim,, Tan, Dun,, Phillip, Glass,, Steve, Reich,, Paul, Chihara, and, William, Bolcom, are, especially, noteworthy., MOVIE, MUSIC, TODAY, The, list, of, fine, composers, working, today, reveals, a, bewildering, variety, in, backgrounds,, musical, styles,, and, techniques., Postmodernism, is, a, term, aptly, applied, to, the, melange, of, musical, styles, in, most, major, films., Chocolat, with, its, beautiful, score, by, Rachel, Portman, has, music, by, Satie, as, well, as, Duke, Ellington, (Caravan, in, a, wonderful, rendition, by, Django, Reinhardt), played, as, Underscore, (not, as, Source)., Many, young, composers, step, out, of, the, universities, or, conservatories, into, prominent, commercial, assignments., Of, course,, many, are, also, out, of, work,, but, the, work, is, there-as, is, an, international, audience, of, many, millions, whose, appetite, for, movies, and, music, seems, insatiable., Paul, Chihara, is, Profesor, of, Music, at, UCLA., Among, his, many, television, and, film, credits,, he, is, composer, for, 100, Centre, Street, which, debuted, this, season, on, A, &, E., aco, homepage, concert, schedule]
