[Sign, Up, Login, Preview, as, Guest, What, is, Guitar, War?, Guitar, War, is, a, website, dedicated, to, helping, our, members, improve, in, all, aspects, of, their, playing,, be, it, style,, technical, prowess,, composing,, or, recording., Competitions, are, available, for, guitarists,, bassists,, piano/synth, players,, singers,, and, composers., Our, members, compete, in, friendly, "cuttings, heads", style, competitions,, looking, to, showcase, their, talents, or, just, get, some, great, critical, feedback., We, know, that, lessons, are, great,, scales, are, good, to, know,, and, you, should, always, practise., But, if, you, really, want, to, focus, in, and, find, out, what, areas, you, can, improve, on,, take, everything, you've, got, and, leave, it, all, in, the, ring, at, Guitar, War., How, does, it, work?, We, encourage, new, members, to, spend, some, time, checking, out, some, of, the, old, and, new, wars., Get, an, idea, for, how, the, competitions, work,, and, what, kind, of, criticism, to, expect., Our, critique, is, smart,, incisive,, and, well-considered., It's, laser-targeted, to, your, individual, competition, and, skill, level., You, won't, find, pointless, limp, comments, or, flame-fests, at, Guitar, War., Without, a, doubt,, we, have, learned, that, receiving, and, giving, critique, is, the, extra, boost, you, need, to, push, your, skills, to, the, highest, possible, levels., Critique, has, a, "Stair-Step", Effect, –, Members, who, consciously, incorporate, critique, from, one, competition, raise, their, skill, levels, at, their, next, competition., Critique, Builds, Confidence, –, While, we, do, discourage, flaming,, we, don't, think, competitors, need, to, be, handled, with, kid, gloves,, either., Healthy, competition, and, frank, commentary, build, a, musician's, confidence, like, you, wouldn't, believe., Giving, Critique, Makes, You, a, Better, Musician, –, We've, found, that, musicians, who, actively, critique, competitions…, themselves, become, better, musicians., It's, a, fact., How, are, members, ranked?, We, use, an, Elo, rating, system, to, determine, competitor, ranks., Each, member, begins, with, an, average, rating, and, then, gains, or, loses, points, based, on, the, outcomes, of, their, wars., Ratings, are, separated, by, guitar,, bass,, synth,, vocal,, and, song,, with, an, overall, rating, that, is, calculated, by, an, average, of, these, categories., The, amount, of, points, you, gain, or, lose, are, based, on, your, Elo, rating, compared, to, your, competitor., Even, Rating, P1, Rank, P2, Rank, 1000, 1000, Win, Chance, 50%, 50%, Win, Points, 15, 15, Lose, Points, 15, 15, Draw, Points, 0, 0, Player, 1, Higher, P1, Rank, P2, Rank, 1200, 1000, Win, Chance, 76%, 24%, Win, Points, 7, 23, Lose, Points, -23, -7, Draw, Points, -8, +8, Elo, rating, is, known, for, being, the, recognised, chess, rating,, and, various, adaptions, are, used, in, numerous, other, competitive, sports, as, well, as, MMO, games, such, as, Guild, Wars, (GvG), World, of, Warcraft, (Arena), and, League, of, Legends., We, believe, that, Elo, ratings, give, a, good, indication, of, a, players, actual, abilities,, and, prevent, players, from, being, penalised, for, mismatched, encounters., War?, What, is, it, good, for?, There's, so, much, more, to, Guitar, War, than, just, the, competitions!, Member's, can, share, their, music, through, "Showcases",, where, you, can, share, your, songs, and, receive, feedback, in, a, non-competitive, atmosphere,, as, well, as, commentating, on, other, members, wars, and, showcases,, and, sharing, in, the, discussions, on, our, members, forums., Give, and, receive, advice,, criticism,, and, assistance, and, hear, some, great, new, talent, while, you're, at, it!, But, I, think, that, if, you, experience, one, of, our, Wars,, you'll, see, that, there's, nothing, to, be, afraid, of!, We, focus, on, positive, and, constructive, criticism, only., If, you, can, open, yourself, to, hearing, honest, opinions, from, musicians, of, all, skill, levels, and, experiences,, then, you, will, truly, be, able, to, start, improving., Music, isn't, about, competition!, While, Guitar, War, is, obviously, a, competition, based, site,, it, exists, for, no, other, reason, than, to, help, musicians, improve, their, ability, to, find, their, voice, on, their, chosen, instrument., We, believe, that, if, you, have, more, tools, available, to, you,, you, are, able, to, express, yourself, better, in, the, way, you, intend., Every, musician, has, a, unique, perspective, and, experience,, and, we, hope, that, by, sharing, your, experiences, and, thoughts, with, us, that, we, can, all, improve, together., How, much, does, all, this, cost?, Nothing!, Membership, is, completely, free!, But, you, might, see, some, advertising..., hey,, we, do, need, to, pay, the, bills., All, we, ask, is, that, you, have, a, good, time,, be, supportive, of, other, members,, and, try, to, be, an, active, member, of, our, online, community.]
