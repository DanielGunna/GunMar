Alexander, Pushkin, used, fairy, tales, to, deal, with, a, lack, of, free, speech, Posted, by Ajay, Kamalakaran on Saturday,, June, 6th, 2015     , June, 6, is, Alexander, Pushkin’s, birth, anniversary.,  This, article, looks, at, how, Pushkin, used, fairy, tales, to, make, political, points., As, well, as, being, recognized, as, a, great, writer, during, his, lifetime,, Alexander, Pushkin, was, also, a, successful, civil, servant., He, graduated, from, the, Imperial, Lyceum,, an, elite, educational, institution, established, by, Tsar, Alexander, I,, and, went, on, to, work, in, the, Russian, Foreign, Office., However,, despite, working, at, the, heart, of, the, establishment,, Pushkin, had, a, social, conscience, and, began, attacking, the, government, in, his, writing., He, joined, the, clandestine, Union, of, Welfare, and, wrote, a, series, of, political, poems, that, were, widely, circulated, in, manuscript., Brilliance, in, exile, In, 1820,, Pushkin, was, summoned, by, the, governor, general, of, St., Petersburg,, Count, Miloradovich,, to, explain, his, epigrams, and, revolutionary, poems, that, were, circulating, at, the, time., Initially,, the, authorities, were, planning, to, exile, the, poet, to, Siberia,, but, thanks, to, the, intervention, of, his, influential, friends,, he, was, “only”, banished, from, St., Petersburg, and, sent, into, exile, in, the, Caucasus,, Moldova, and, Crimea., This, period, turned, out, to, be, one, of, Pushkin’s, most, productive, times,, during, which, he, wrote, many, romantic, poems, and, his, brilliant, work, Eugene, Onegin., Pushkin’s, controversial, poems, resurfaced, in, 1825, when, they, were, linked, to, the, failed, Decembrist, Revolt, to, overthrow, Tsar, Nicholas, I,, but, the, tsar, allowed, the, poet, to, return, from, exile, the, following, year,, believing, that, he, had, abandoned, his, revolutionary, sentiments., In, fact,, Pushkin, had, simply, decided, to, be, more, discreet., By, this, point, he, was, already, renowned, as, a, great, poet, and, was, aware, that, the, tsar, himself, was, closely, scrutinizing, his, works., However,, if, we, read, the, series, of, verse, fairy, tales, he, wrote, in, the, 1830s, in, the, political, context, of, their, time,, we, find, that, there, is, often, more, to, them, than, meets, the, eye., A, reformed, character?, One, Pushkin’s, first, fairy, tales,, “The, Tale, of, Tsar, Saltan,”, published, in, 1831,, tells, the, story, of, a, tsar, who, chooses, the, youngest, of, three, sisters, to, be, his, wife., However,, her, elder, sisters, become, jealous, of, her, status, and, when, she, gives, birth,, they, arrange, to, have, her, sealed, up, in, a, barrel, and, thrown, into, the, sea, along, with, her, baby, son,, Prince, Gvidon., The, pair, wash, up, on, a, remote, island,, and, the, prince,, who, grew, while, in, the, barrel,, goes, hunting, and, ends, up, saving, an, enchanted, swan, from, a, predatory, bird. , The, swan, creates, a, city,, where, the, prince, rules, successfully., Eventually, the, swan, turns, into, a, princess, and, marries, Prince, Gvidon,, who, is, finally, reunited, with, his, father,, the, tsar., This, story, of, separation, and, reunification, can, be, seen, as, a, thinly, veiled, allegory, of, Pushkin’s, own, situation, and, was, perhaps, designed, to, convince, Tsar, Nicholas, I, that, the, writer, truly, was, reformed., A, veneer, of, conformism, Whether, or, not, Nicholas, did, see, the, parallels, between, Pushkin, and, Prince, Gvidon,, he, allowed, the, writer, to, continue, publishing,, and, even, commissioned, literary, works, from, him., In, 1833,, Pushkin, wrote, “The, Tale, of, the, Fisherman, and, the, Fish,”, which, is, about, a, fisherman, who, catches, a, golden, fish, that, promises, to, fulfill, any, wish, in, exchange, for, its, freedom., The, old, fisherman, and, his, wife, have, been, poor, their, whole, lives,, and, the, sudden, opportunity, to, get, rich, sparks, an, intense, greed, in, the, wife., First, she, asks, for, a, palace,, then, to, become, a, noblewoman,, then, to, become, the, provincial, ruler,, and, finally, the, Tsarina., Eventually, the, couple, loses, everything, when, the, woman, wants, to, become, the, Ruler, of, the, Sea., Robert, Chandler,, a, renowned, Russian, literary, translator, has, argued, that, the, fisherman’s, wife, is, a, caricature, of, Empress, Catherine, the, Great., The, empress, deposed, her, husband, Peter, III,, effectively, usurping, his, power, in, the, way, that, the, fisherman’s, wife, does., She, also, fought, two, wars, with, the, Ottoman, Empire, to, gain, dominion, over, the, Black, Sea, –, fruitless, campaigns, that, wasted, a, great, deal, of, money, and, lives., Pushkin, as, a, political, tool, Other, fairy, tales, reveal, different, and, more, politically, compelling, stories., Pushkin, was, an, atheist,, which, was, unusual, for, the, time, and, the, circles, he, moved, in., “The, Tale, of, the, Priest, and, of, His, Workman, Balda”, is, about, a, lazy, priest, who, tries, to, exploit, a, cheap, worker., Russia, was, highly, religious, at, that, time,, and, the, attack, on, an, Orthodox, Church, priest, would, have, been, seen, as, blasphemous., The, fairy, tale,, written, in, 1830,, was, published, posthumously, in, 1840,, and, the, character, of, the, priest, was, replaced, with, a, merchant, to, avoid, a, backlash, from, the, powerful, Church., However,, the, priest, was, reinstated, in, Soviet, publications, of, Pushkin’s, fairy, tales, –, the, government, of, the, new, Russia, had, its, own, political, ax, to, grind., This, fairy, tale, is, also, about, exploitation,, which, was, very, prevalent, in, a, society, where, serfdom, was, still, legal., At, the, end,, the, priest, is, criticized, for, “rushing, off, after, cheapness,”, and, this, was, also, something, that, the, communists, exploited, a, century, later., The, first, Bolsheviks, looked, back, over, works, by, Russian, 19th-century, writers, to, find, acceptable, messages, they, could, use, in, creating, the, new, socialist, culture,, and, Pushkin’s, work, proved, brilliant, in, this, respect., His, views, on, serfdom,, the, Orthodox, Church, and, the, oppressive, tsarist, state, fitted, neatly, into, the, communist, outlook,, so, the, writer, was, promoted, and, revered, from, the, first, years, of, the, Soviet, Union, –, even, more, so, than, in, the, 19th, century., Pushkin’s, last, fairy, tale, in, verse,, “The, Golden, Cockerel,”, was, written, in, 1834,, three, years, before, his, tragic, death, in, a, duel. , The, story, which, was, based, on, “Legend, of, the, Arabian, Astrologer”, from, Washington, Irving’s, “The, Tales, of, the, Alhambra,” was, not, political, in, any, way., However,, when, Nikolai, Rimsky-Korsakov, adapted, it, into, an, opera, in, 1908,, he, turned, it, into, a, satire, on, the, waning, Romanov, dynasty, and, the, Russo-Japanese, war,, which, was, one, of, the, most, humiliating, events, in, Russian, history., “The, Golden, Cockerel”, was, Rimsky-Korsakov’s, last, opera,, initially, rejected, by, the, censors, and, only, staged, after, the, composer’s, death., This, article, was, first, published, by, the Russia, &, India, Report , Constant, is, the, Rain, Posted, by Rex,

wanted, to, move, out, of, India,, the, reasons, would, be, no, different, from, why, Western, expatriates, (a, posher, word, for, short, term, immigrants), look, for, jobs, in, emerging, Asian, countries. It, would, essentially, be, a, combination, of, better, pay,, an, opportunity, to, learn, a, new, language, and, be, a, part, of, a, new, culture,, and, just, to, experience, some, new, kind, of, adventure., However,, I, will, be, the, last, person, on, earth, to, judge, those, who, are, trying, to, escape, poverty,, strife, and, violence, and, start, a, new, life, in, another, country,, even, if, they, are, going, on, rickety, fishing, boats., Sure,, mass, immigration, to, a, country, with, large, unemployment, and, depleting, resources, is, not, the, best, scenario, for, either, the, immigrant, or, the, host, nation., But, then,, these, people, whether, they, are, Latin, Americans, trying, to, sneak, in, to, the, United, States,, or, Africans, and, Arabs, looking, for, a, better, life, in, Europe, or, Burmese, refugees, trying, to, reach, Malaysia,, essentially, what, they’re, doing, is, no, different, from, what, Europeans, did, for, centuries., Europeans,

lines, of, what, happened, in, Asia., But,, labelling, everyone, who, is, in, search, of, a, better, life, as, a, criminal, simply, disgusts, me., If, we’re, going, to, use, this, as, a, yardstick,, we, might, as, well, stop, glorifying, people, like, Christopher, Columbus, and, Vasco, da, Gama., Tailpiece:, Asia, was, doing, fine, enough, before, the, Europeans, came, here, on, a, “civilising,

of, foreign, business, associates, for, dinner., This, was, in, the, late, 1990s, when, the, country, had, just, begun, to, recover, from, chronic, food, shortages, and, a, few, years, after, people, had, to, queue, just, to, get, some, bread., Despite, not, being, very, well, off,, the, family, managed, to, get, the, best, local, seafood,, good, Bulgarian, wine, and, other, delicacies, to, make,

made, them, thrifty., This, is, also, reflected, in, the, way,, Europeans, tend, to, be, far, more, conservative, spenders, while, on, vacation, compared, to, the, Russians., Just, like, Indians, believe, in, the, concept, of, Atithi, Devo, Bhava-, the, guest, is, God,, Russians, traditionally, consider, guests, providers, of, good, luck., There, is, certain, logic, to, this, kind, of, thinking, as, in, most, cases, guests, bring, enthusiasm, and, positive, energy., I, particularly, enjoy, taking, my, guests, around, town, since, I, always, get, some, fresh, perspective, on, where, I, live, and, manage, to, see, things, in, a, different, light., Russian, society, is, very, much, open, and, people, are, often, curious, to, know, those, from, strange, and, exotic, lands., I, could, fill, up, hundreds, of, pages, writing, about, experiences, on, interactions, with, hosts, and, even, strangers, on, long-distance, trains, that, led, to, meaningful, and, long-term, friendships,, but, one, particular, experience, stands, out., It, was, the, summer, of, 2003, and, I, decided, travel, with, two, friends, from, Sakhalin, to, St, Petersburg, by, (ferry, and, then), train., We, had, around, 21, hours, of, transit, in, a, town, called, Vanino, in, the, Khabarovsk, territory., The, small, town, is, pretty, and, is, surrounded, by, hills, with, views, of, the, Tatar, Strait,, but, we, felt, there, was, little, else, to, write, home, about., In, the, afternoon,, while, sunbathing, by, the, river,, a, friend, of, ours, went, to, have, a, conversation, with, a, local., He, asked, the, lady, whether, there, were, any, waterfalls, in, the, nearby, hills., After, laughing, at, his, question,, she, asked, where, we, were, from, and, when, he, mentioned, that, it, was, two, Sakhaliners, and, an, Indian, (all, of, us, in, were, in, our, early-20s, at, that, time),, she, offered, to, show, us, some, places, in, the, town, and, its, outskirts., She, drove, us, up, hills, from, where, there, were, the, most, stunning, sea, views, and, then, took, us, to, a, local, outdoor, sports, club,, where, she, giggled, as, she, introduced, friends, to, a, visitor, from, India, out, of, all, places., We, were, honestly, overwhelmed, with, the, hospitality, and, the, kindness, of, the, person, who, was, a, total, strange, hours, earlier., Of, course,, this, was, in, “another, world,”, a, place, where, the, Internet, was, still, developing, and, there, was, no, social, media, or, smartphones., We, did, manage, to, stay, in, touch, for, several, years, after, this, chance, encounter., Vanino, and, nearby, Sov, Gavan, turned, from, pretty, yet, unexciting, towns, at, the, end, of, the, Russian, mainland, to, beautiful, and, cultured, places, where, people, lived, quite, but, interesting, lives., Contact, with, strangers, comes, with, its, own, risks, in, this, day, and, age,, but, then, sometimes, your, own, intuition, can, be, a, great, guide., I, also, witnessed, great, hospitality, when, visiting, cousins, and, grandparents, of, friends, in, smaller, Russian, towns, and, cities., What, was, really, touching, was, the, way, the, family, members, of, these, warmly, embraced, me, like, I, was, one, of, their, own., One, of, the, keys, to, really, enjoying, a, more, unique, Russian, experience, is, to, learn, the, language., English, is, not, even, close, to, being, widely, spoken, outside, of, Moscow, and, St, Petersburg, and, there, are, generations, of, cultured,, well-readand, sophisticated, people, who, know, so, much, more, about, India, and, its, traditions, than, many, of, us, know, about, Russia., Of, course,, I, have, seenfriendships, conquer, the, language, barrier, with, people, somehow, finding, a, way, to, communicate, despite, not, being, under, the, influence, of, alcohol.,  Being, fluent, in, Russian, is, the, best, way, to, really, build, strong, relationships, in, the, country, and, also, to, be, part, of, a, society, that, is, open,, welcoming, and, embracing., A, version, of, this, article, was, published, in, the Russia, &, India, Report, Page, 1, of, 56:1, 2, 3, 4, »Last, », Member, Login,
