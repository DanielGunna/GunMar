Impressions-What, Happened?, Generally, speaking,, Employers, hire, people, they, know,, first, and, people, sent, to, them, from, people, they, know,, second., Humans, are, afraid, of, people, they, do, not, know, and, humans, take, care, of, their, buddies., It, has, been, suggested, that, as, many, as, 7, out, 10, positions, are, filled, through, personal, contacts., The, better, the, job, and, the, better, the, pay,, the, greater, the, chance, it, will, be, offered, through, a, personal, contact., If, this, is, true,, job, seekers, would, be, wise, to, make, a, list, of, every, person, they, know, and, contact, them, for, assistance, finding, a, job., After, we, have, exhausted, our, list, of, every, person, we, know,, if, we, are, still, not, working,, we, need, to, meet, more, people., Where?, Every, person, you, meet, may, be, able, to, help, you, find, a, job., Be, nice, to, people., Get, out, into, your, community., Be, willing, to, help, others, and, you, may, meet,

of, Business-Find, out, if, there, is, a, potential, job., Do, research, so, that, you, are, able, to, talk, about, the, business, before, asking, for, a, job., Whether, you, go, on, your, own, or, are, sent,, the, first, visit, to, a, prospective, employer, is, a, time, to, collect, information., Write, down, the, name, of, every, person, encountered., Names, are, very, important., Be, observant., What, is, the, company, selling?, How, are, they, advertising?, Are, the, employees, happy, on, the, job?, Are, they, professional?, How, were, you, treated?, If, you, have, not, asked, for, a, job, and, are, not, selling, anything,, then, are, you, not, a, potential, customer?, Actually, you, are, shopping, for, a, job, and, you, are, trying, to, determine, if, this, company, is, worth, your, effort., Look, at, their, signs., Read, their, literature., What, message, is, the, company, sending, out, to, the, universe?, Ask, yourself,, "Why, do, I, want, to, work, for, this, organization?", Newspaper, stories, or, magazines, article, may, be, available, at, the, local, library., The, employer, may, be, in, the, yellow, pages, or, advertise, over, the, radio, or, local, television.When, we, can, speak, intelligently, about, a, place, of, business,, we, have, given, that, employer, respect., By, focusing, on, the, employer, we, are, better, able, to, determine, if, the, company, can, meet, our, needs., By, focusing, on, the, employer, we, are, displaying, interest, in, the, needs, of, the, company., Business, Research, Tutorial, is, on, Internet, at, http://www.learnwebskills.com/company/index.html, We, are, being, assessed, consciously, and, unconsciously, along, every, step, in, the, job, search, process., We, must, look, our, best,, feel, our, best, and, be, aware, of, our, actions., If, we, accept, the, idea, that, the, hiring, process, is, uncomfortable, for, both, the, job, seeker, and, the, employer, we, will, take, great, care, in, creating, a, positive, image, before, asking, for, a, job., Be, aware, of, your, appearance., Extremely, beautiful, people,, with, charming, personalities, who, smell, good,, are, well, groomed, and, neatly, dressed,, have, little, trouble, getting, job, offers., The, rest, of, us, should, look, in, the, mirror, or, ask, someone, we, trust, for, an, honest, opinion, of, the, image, we, are,

get, hired, faster.Basically,, the, object, is, to, be, yourself., Most, employers, prefer, people, who, are, open,, honest, and, speak, straight, across,, person, to, person., It, is, not, necessarily, the, person, with, the, most, skills, who, gets, hired., It, is, a, person, who, the, employer, likes, and, believes, will, fit, into, the, organization., Success, in, establishing, comfort, naturally, increases, with, additional, visits., The, impression, is, dependent, upon, how, we, look,, how, we, feel, and, also,, how, we, act., How, we, fill, out, an, application, is, as, important, as, the, information, we, put, down., We, must, follow, directions,, be, neat,, complete, and, avoid, spelling, errors., The, complete, application, is, a, reflection, of, how, we, deal, with, paper., Prepare, for, contacts, and, interviews, by, practicing, your, presentation., Be, able, to, briefly, talk, about, your, education,, experience, and, abilities, in, relationship, to, the,

out, loud,, not, to, memorize,, rather, just, to, have, experience, saying, the, words., Thinking, about, what, you, will, say, is, not, the, same, as, saying, what, you, will, say., Bottom, line,,

employees., Every, job, is, hardest, at, the, beginning, and, gets, easier, with, experience., Saying, something, like,, "I, know, I, can, learn, your, method, of, operation,", tells, an, employer, you, have, faith, in, your, ability, to, learn, the, way, the, employer, wants, it, done., Understand, that, if, you, are, being, interviewed, the, employer, is, deciding, whether, or, not, you, are, a, pleasant,, hard, working,, honest, person, with, enough, confidence, to, get, the, job, done., Have, confidence, in, your, ability, and, speak, from, your, heart., Before, asking, for, a, job,

are, still, interested., You, can, say, something, like,, "Just, stopped, by, to, say, hello., I, know, you, are, busy., I, do, not, want, to, be, a, pest,, but, I, do, not, want, you, to, forget, me.", If, you, really, want, the, job,, you, can, continue, to, make, follow-up, contacts, until, the, employer, hires, you, or, tells, you, clearly, that, you, are, not, being, considered., Ten,
