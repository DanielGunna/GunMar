vicious,, surprisingly, ahead, of, the, curve, album, for, thrash, even, in, 1988, -, guitarist, Mike, Scaccia's, long,, cutting, tremolo, riffage, in, many, respects, comes, across, as, a, distant, ancestor, of, what, later, black, and, death, metal, bands, ended, up, doing., There's, an, unusual, emphasis, on, melodic, fluidity, for, thrash,, amid, the, chunkier, bludgeoning, riffs, &, the, dirty, b-movie, vibe, evoked, in, both, melodicism, and, the, ranting,, shouted, vocals., Freaks, is, a, bit, different, from, the, debut, in, that, there's, a, great, emphasis, on, balance, -, whereas, the, first, album, just, blazed, along,, this, EP, has, a, habit, of, using, mid-paced, sections, to, punctuate, the, faster,, more, fluid, parts., To, make, another, entirely, anachronistic, comparison,, the, difference, is, kind, of, like, the, same, one, between, the, first, two, Massacra, albums., This, EP, doesn't, lack, for, intensity, though, -, it's, just, that, Freaks, comes, across, as, a, more, cohesive, &, meaty, effort., The, band's, songwriting, skills, are, at, their, sharpest, here,, frankly;, Scaccia, was, a, masterful, guitarist, who, had, a, knack, for, long,, furrowing, riffs, that, hooked, their, way, into, your, head,, but, it's, really, the, great, sense, of, pacing, &, build, up, that, makes, this, EP, really, shine., The, title, song, is, a, great, example, of, it,, mid-paced, riffage, building, &, layering, upon, themselves,, almost, in, a, Slayer, circa, Hell, Awaits, like, manner, before, the, main, riff, for, the, verse, reveals, itself,, explosive, tremolo, riffage, coming, in, to, rip, everything, to, shreds., For, all, of, Scaccia's, guitar, wizardry, &, the, skill, of, the, rest, of, the, band,, what, makes, it, special, is, that, talent, is, focused, into, songs, that, evoke, a, grimy,, fucked-up, &, kinda, cultish, vibe,, purely, by, dint, of, the, riffs, -, and, it, cannot, be, understated, how, much, the, riffs, rip, shit, up, on, this, album, -, and, the, intricate, yet, memorable, manner, in, how, the, songs, unfold., "Six, Feet, Under/Worms, of, the, Earth", is, a, masterful, in, its, own, way,, full, of, long, peaks, &, valleys,, anticipating, each, turn, in, almost, predator-esque, manner, before, finally, exploding., The, final, part, of, the, song, is, particularly, noteworthy,, being, conventionally, melodic, yet, with, a, grimy,, unsettling, vibe, of, decay, emerging, from, the, same, time., Yeah,, this, EP, rules, and, it's, their, best, effort., Go, grab, it, if, you, can., VeteranOfThePsychicWars, (668, reviews), Songs, About, Fucking, Big, Black, (1987), An, essential, piece, in, the, history, of, the, American, alternative, rock, genre,, Big, Black, pushed, the, boundaries, of, hard, rock, and, hardcore, from, epic, into, overpowering., While, it, would, be, hard, to, say, that, they, were, the, first, to, noise, rock,, they, certainly, helped, shaped, it's, distinctive, sound., It, helped, that, they, stayed, true, to, the, movement, they, created:, when, they, started, to, become, popular,, they, canned, the, whole, operation, and, called, it, quits., The, result, is, the, very, album, you, see, before, you., Of, course,, this, was, far, from, the, last, contribution, to, music, industry, by, guitarist/vocalist, Steve, Albini,, who, would, go, on, produce, the, work, and, influence, the, direction, of, some, of, music's, most, important, players,, including, PJ, Harvey,, Pixies,, and, Nirvana., If, there, was, one, word, I, could, use, that, best, describes, Songs, About, Fucking,, it, would, be, "oppressive"., Here, we, have, 13, (14, on, some, pressings), vignettes, of, raw, and, pure, anger,, songs, about, graphic, sex,, rape,, murder,, methods, of, execution,, and, bizarre,, Lord, Of, The, Flies, style, empires, made, ostensibly, up, out, of, cats,, and, all, sorts, of, general, depravity., The, songs, themselves, feel, impelled, to, drill, feelings, of, claustrophobia, and, anxiety, into, the, minds, of, those, unfortunate, enough, bear, witness, to, it., This, leaves, us, only, one, question:, Done, any, of, this, actually, equate, to, a, good, listen?, Yes, and, no., It, doesn't, take, a, music, theory, expert, to, tell, that, the, stuff, here, is, brilliant, in, what, it, sets, out, to, do., It's, anger, and, malice, with, nothing, held, back., The, only, problem, is, that, all, of, this, is,, frankly,, not, a, very, enjoyable, record., It's, hard, to, sit, down, and, listen, to, it, all, in, one, sitting,, let, alone, go, back, and, listen, again, for, the, sake, of, this, review., If, any, one, rock, album, can, make, the, listener, feel, stark, naked, and, ugly,, it, would, be, this, one., However,, if, the, worst, thing, I, can, say, about, it, is, that, I, didn't, have, "fun", listening, to, it,, I'm, sure, it, would, mean, a, whole, lot, to, people, who, set, out, to, instill, these, feelings, of, queasy, discomfort, in, the, first, place., aaaaahhhhhhh, (5, reviews), Music, for, the, Masses, Depeche, Mode, (1987), ELECTRÓNICA, /, POP, TECNOPOP, Puede, que, el, título, empezara, como, una, broma, de, Martin, Gore, pero, al, final, se, tornó, en, pura, profecía., Así, de, contundente, y, masivo, es,, suena, y, resuena, este, "Music, for, the, Masses",, la, auténtica, piedra, de, toque,, el, gran, salto, hacia, delante, en, el, canon, de, los, de, Basildon., Tampoco, es, que, fuera, un, pelotazo, en, su, época., Ha, sido, el, tiempo, el, que, lo, ha, ido, poniendo, en, su, lugar, como, el, disco, más, importante, de, su, carrera,, el, que, los, acabó, de, poner, en, el, mapa,, el, que, les, enseñó, el, noble, arte, del, arreglo, y, el, que, destiló, el, equilibrio, perfecto, entre, la, oscuridad, y, la, luz,, un, juego, de, contrastes, que, ya, apuntaba, de, manera, notable, "Black, Celebration", (1986), y, que, acabó, totalmente, desequilibrado, en, favor, de, lo, siniestro, en, el, espectacular, "Violator", (1990)., Un, equilibrio, que, queda, certificado, para, siempre, en, joyas, como, "Never, Let, Me, Down, Again",, "The, Things, You, Said",, "Strangelove",, "Sacred",, "Behind, the, Wheel",, "To, Have, and, to, Hold", o, "Nothing",, auténticos, himnos, que, ayudarían, a, que, la, gira, que, seguiría, al, disco, fuera, inolvidable., Así, se, ha, registrado, para, la, posteridad, en, el, rotundo, "101", (1989)., "Music, for, the, Masses", es, un, disco, para, cantar, y, soñar,, un, trabajo, de, sonido, hechizante, que, cree, en, el, pop, sobre, todas, las, cosas, y, que, es, fruto, en, buena, medida, de, la, mano, que, Alan, Wilder, metió, en, el, estudio., Ya, sé, que, el, mérito, último, siempre, estará, en, la, pluma, y, la, mente, del, genial, Martin, Gore,, pero, eso, es, algo, que, todo, el, mundo, sabe., Por, eso, no, me, resisto, a, señalar, la, contribución, de, Wilder, en, las, mezclas, y, la, producción,, trabajo, arduo, del, que, los, otros, tres, del, grupo, pasaron, un, poco., Un, esfuerzo, que, ha, ayudado, sin, duda, a, convertir, el, disco, en, una, leyenda, por, encima, de, todo, su, engolamiento, y, su, hinchazón,, de, toda, esa, pena, adolescente, siempre, al, borde, de, la, hemorragia, emocional., Da, igual,, estas, cosas, tuvieron, su, momento, de, gloria, y, me, parece, a, mí, que, siempre, lo, tendrán., Track, ratings, show, A1, Never, Let, Me, Down, Again, A2, The, Things, You, Said, A3, Strangelove, A4, Sacred, A5, Little, 15,  , B1, Behind, the, Wheel, B2, I, Want, You, Now,  , B3, To,

playing, "Stardust", is, one, of, the, many, albums, that, Bob, Weinstock, cobbled, together, in, the, mid, 60's, of, unissued, takes, from, Coltrane's, sessions, for, Prestige, in, the, late, 50's., These, four, tracks, come, from, two, sessions, that, were, recorded, July, (tracks, 1, and, 3), and, December, (tracks, 2, and, 4), of, 1958., On, the, first, session,, Trane, is, joined, by, trumpeter, Wilbur, Harden,, pianist, Red, Garland,, bassist, Paul, Chambers,, and, drummer, Jimmy, Cobb., Garland, and, Chambers, are, back, for, the, second, session,, but, with, Art, Taylor, on, drums,, and, a, young, Freddie, Hubbard, playing, trumpet, on, track, 4., With, a, typical, Prestige, release, one, can, usually, expect, four, or, five, mid, or, uptempo, swingers,, with, one, or, two, ballads, breaking, things, up., This, release, changes, things, up, a, bit, with, three, ballads,, and, just, one, mid-tempo, swinger., The, title, track, opens, the, record,, with, Coltrane, giving, a, lovely, reading, of, the, classic, Hoagy, Carmichael, melody,, embellished, with, just, the, right, amount, of, whole, tone, Trane-isms., His, solo, is, equally, sublime,, blending, rich, lyricism, with, occasional, flashes, of, tasteful, modernity., The, remaining, solos, by, the, band, are, rather, standard, jam-session, fare,, and, Chambers', bowed, solo, goes, on, for, maybe, a, bit, too, long., "Time, After, Time", is, another, often-played, standard, that, finds, Coltrane, taking, quite, a, few, liberties, with, the, familiar, melody., Once, again, the, improvisation, veers, toward, the, "blowing, session", variety, and, Trane's, playing, is, the, clear, highlight, of, the, piece., "Love, Thy, Neighbor", is, the, sole, uptempo, tune, and, Coltrane, shines,, this, time, with, his, developing, "sheets, of, sound", technique, in, the, form, of, some, mind-boggling, sixteenth, note, lines., Garland, also, gives, a, nice, solo,, starting, off, by, echoing, the, last, idea, of, Harden's, solo, and, developing, it, nicely., The, program, closes, with, another, familiar, ballad,, the, Harburg-Schwartz, classic,, "Then, I'll, Be, Tired, of, You.", Once, again, Coltrane's, playing, is, the, highlight,, though, Hubbard's, solo, near, the, end, of, the, track, is, also, interesting, and, sounds, as, though, he, is, almost, imitating, Coltrane's, style, of, phrasing, on, trumpet., Despite, the, somewhat, unceremonious, creation, and, release, of, this, album,, it, makes, for, a, fairly, satisfying, listen,, largely, on, par, with, the, recordings, of, Coltrane, that, were, originally, released, on, Prestige., Trane, is, clearly, the, star, of, the, show,, and, this, time, around, his, engaging, approach, to, ballad-playing, is, featured,, though, the, sole, uptempo, track, gives, a, nice, taste, of, his, more, celebrated, bebop, technique., While, it's, not, on, the, same, level, as, the, music, he, was, recording, when, this, album, was, released,, it's, about, on, the, same, level, as, most, of, his, other, Prestige, recordings, and, a, generally, satisfying, listen, overall., jazzthreadguy, (330, reviews), Latest, Ratings, Joni,
