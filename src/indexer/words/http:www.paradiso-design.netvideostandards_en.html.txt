standard, in, the, world, wide, web, this, summary, should, provide, an, essentially, correct, overview, of, the, different, refresh, rates, of, PAL, and, NTSC., At, this, point, it, is, important, to, consider, the, transfer, from, film, material, to, the, standards, of, PAL, and, NTSC., Furthermore, we, have, to, mind, the, video, format, MPEG-2,, which, is, used, for, DVDs., [Video,

(frames, per, second, -, full-images, -, progressive), usually, on, 35, mm, film, material., The, film, has, a, frame, rate, of, 24, frames, per, second., However,, in, the, cinema, the, film, is, not, played, with, 24, Hz., In, old, movie, projectors, the, Maltese, cross, drive, (which, is, in, new, models, substituted, with, a, step, motor), is, used, to, pause, the, film, strip, in, front, of, the, film, gate, for, a, short, moment, thus, the, projection, of, the, image, can, happen., In, this, moment, the, image, will, be, shined, through, either, twice, or, thrice, -, depending, on, the, projector., For, the, intermittence, a, rotary, shutter, is, responsible, which, is, installed, between, source, of, light, and, film, strip., For, us, not, noticing, the, movement, of, the, film, strip, on, the, film, reel, the, canvas, has, to, become, black, for, a, very, short, time, between, the, film, frames., At, 24, black, time, intervals, per, second, we, would, notice, a, clear, flickering., With, the, double, or, triple, refresh, rate, of, 48, Hz, or, 72, Hz, the, human, eye, does, not, notice, these, black, time, intervals, any, longer., Hence,, the, cinema, picture, is, noticed, to, be, fluent, and, without, any, flickering., Hz, =, Hertz, =, 1/s, (1/sec), -, "Hz", means, in, our, case, "pictures, per, second"., We, can, call, a, frame, rate, of, 24, fps, (respective, 48, Hz/72, Hz), the, nominal, cinema, speed., Measuring, the, run, time, completely, from, the, beginning, to, the, end, we, will, find, out, that, the, playing, speed, in, the, cinema, usually, varies, from, 24, fps., A, motion, picture, film, mostly, is, somewhat, faster, played, whereby, the, frame, rate, can, be, located, between, 24, fps, and, 26, fps., 2.1, NTSC, (National, Television, System, Committee), This, format, is, used, particularly, in, the, USA,, Canada,, Mexico, and, Japan., NTSC, altogether, uses, 525, scan, lines,, thereof, approx., 485, are, visible., The, color, subcarrier, has, a, frequency, of, approx., 3.58, MHz, in, the, case, of, analog, NTSC., The, common, NTSC, color, subcarrier, system, is, also, called, "NTSC, M", or, "NTSC, 3.58"., The, refresh, rate, is, 29.97, Hz, or, 29.97, fps, respectively., This, corresponds, to, 59.94, Hz, (interlaced, -, half-images), or, 59.94, fields/s, respectively, which, can, be, derived, from, the, NTSC, 2:3-Pulldown, based, on, 23.976, fps, of, NTSC, films., For, detailed, information, related, to, the, Pulldown, refer, to, the, "Transfer", section, later, in, the, text., The, frame, rate, of, 23.976, fps, also, conforms, to, the, so-called, NTSC-Film, standard., The, digital, standard, resolution, is, 720x480, pixel, for, DVDs, (Digital, Versatile, Disc),, 480x480, pixel, for, Super, Video, CDs, (SVCD), and, 352x240, pixel, for, Video, CDs, (VCD)., The, much-seen, "NTSC, rounding, up", of, 59.94, Hz, to, 60, Hz, as, well, as, 29.97, Hz, to, 30, Hz, can, be, very, confusing, if, we, take, a, more, closer, look, to, the, TV, formats., In, former, times, the, values, 30, Hz/60, Hz, were, quite, correct,, but, with, the, implementation, of, the, color, television, the, NTSC, refresh, rates, were, lowered, from, 60, Hz, to, 59.94, Hz, and, from, 30, Hz, to, 29.97, Hz, for, preventing, audio, flutter, during, broadcast., However,, the, NTSC, refresh, rate, is, not, 59.94, Hz, exactly, but, 60, Hz*1000/1001, =, 59.9400599400599400..., Hz, ≈, 59.94, Hz., In, the, following, sections, of, the, text, we, will, refer, to, the, latter, value, of, 59.94, Hz., The, reason, why, the, NTSC, refresh, rate, was, changed, by, implementation, of, color, television, is, explained, by, Bob, Myers, in, a, detailed, article., •, The, original, FCC, standard:, 525, scan, lines, interlaced, with, a, 60, Hz, refresh, rate, 525/2, =, 262.5, lines/field, 262.5, [lines/field]*60, Hz, =, 15750, lines/[field*s], :=, horizontal, frequency, (line, rate), (means, that, 15750, lines, are, transferred, per, field, and, per, second), 15750, Hz*455/2, =, 3.583125, MHz, (hypothetical, color, subcarrier, frequency), •, The, NTSC, standard, of, color, television:, 525, scan, lines, interlaced, with, a, 60*1000/1001, Hz, refresh, rate, 525/2, =, 262.5, lines/field, 262.5, [lines/field]*60*1000/1001, Hz, =, 15734.2657..., lines/[field*s], horizontal, frequency, ≈, 15734, Hz, 15734.2657..., Hz*455/2, =, 3.57954545..., MHz, (color, subcarrier, frequency), For, detailed, information, related, to, the, Television, Standards, of, all, countries, using, NTSC, refer, to, the, worldwide, comparison., 2.2, PAL, (Phase, Alternating, Line), This, format, is, used, particularly, in, Western, Europe,, Australia,, New, Zealand, and, in, some, areas, of, Asia., PAL, uses, altogether, 625, scan, lines,, thereof, approx., 575, are, visible., The, color, subcarrier, has, a, frequency, of, approx., 4.43, MHz, in, the, case, of, analog, PAL, (complementary, view)., Special, NTSC, or, PAL, color, subcarrier, signals, will, not, be, transferred, via, connections, like, SCART, (RGB), and, YUV., Such, a, signal, is, only, transferred, via, connections, like, Composite, Video,, RCA,, FBAS, and, Y/C, or, S-Video, (S-VHS), respectively., The, refresh, rate, is, 25, Hz, or, 25, fps, respectively., This, corresponds, to, 50, Hz, (interlaced), or, 50, fields/s, respectively., The, digital, standard, resolution, is, 720x576, pixel, for, DVDs,, 480x576, pixel, for, SVCDs, and, 352x288, pixel, for, VCDs., Related, to, NTSC,, PAL, has, a, shorter, run, time, because, of, the, higher, amount, of, "fps", -, PAL, movies, are, (normally), not, cut,, but, they, are, "faster", (PAL, Speedup)., For, detailed, information, related, to, the, PAL, Speedup, refer, to, the, "Transfer", section, later, in, the, text., For, detailed, information, related, to, the, Television, Standards, of, all, countries, using, PAL, refer, to, the, worldwide, comparison., 2.3, SECAM, (Système, en, Couleur, avec, Mémoire), Sometimes, known, as, "Séquentiel, Couleur, avec, Mémoire", -, means, "sequential, color, with, memory"., This, format, is, used, particularly, in, France, and, still, in, most, areas, of, Russia., Some, eastern, European, states, have, reconverted, from, SECAM, to, PAL., SECAM, has, technical, similarities, to, PAL, but, it, is, not, part, of, the, DVD, standards,, for, we, can, leave, it, out, here., For, detailed, information, related, to, the, Television, Standards, of, all, countries, using, SECAM, refer, to, the, worldwide, comparison., 3.1, Interlacing, Concerning, the, Interlacing, there, are, used, two, fields, (half-images,, half-frames,, interlaced), in, contrary, to, one, frame, (full-frame,, progressive)., Upper, field, (top), -, all, odd, lines, (1,3,5,7,, etc.), are, drawn, first., Lower, field, (bottom), -, now, all, even, lines, (2,4,6,8,, etc.), are, drawn., As, looking, at, the, TV, one, recognizes, a, picture, like, the, one, above., The, lines, will, be, written, from, the, left, to, the, right, starting, with, line, 1., The, first, half-image, is, represented, by, the, odd, lines, whereas, the, second, half-image, consists, of, all, even, lines., If, we, put, these, half-images, together, we, get, 25, frames, per, second, on, PAL., For, the, half-images, are, delayed, mutually, and, the, picture, tube, afterglows, for, a, certain, time,, wherefore, the, human, eye, has, the, impression, of, seeing, 50, "full", pictures, per, second., Of, course,, these, half-images, are, transferred, without, the, white, lines, which, are, seen, in, the, picture, above., It, was, one, aim, to, save, some, bandwidth, by, the, half-image, transmission., This, is, the, reason, why, fields, (example:, 704x240, pixel, in, ATSC, format, 480i), are, only, half, as, large, as, frames, (example:, 704x480, pixel, in, ATSC, format, 480i)., 3.2, Interlaced, Usual, old, televisions,, video, recorder, (VCRs),, video, cassettes, (VHS, -, video, home, system;, in, the, past, also, known, as, vertical, helical, scan),, video, cameras, and, usual, old, DVD, players, need, or, display, interlaced, material., There, are, also, produced, DVDs, completely, interlaced,, e.g., most, sport, DVDs,, many, music, DVDs,, adult, films, and, TV, series, published, on, DVD., One, also, finds, low, budget, movies, shot, with, a, video, camera, in, an, interlaced, state., Furthermore, many, "making, of", documentations, and, specials, on, DVDs, are, completely, interlaced., 3.3, Progressive, LCD, displays,, plasma, displays,, CRT/DLP/LCD/LCOS, projectors, and, PC, monitors, can, write, only, progressive, pictures., If, interlaced, material, is, presented, at, these, devices, it, has, to, be, converted, for, progressive, displays, first., "NTSC, progressive", and, "PAL, progressive", are, standards, for, hardware, DVD, players, which, support, full-frame, output., 3.4, Deinterlacing, Reassembling, two, fields, to, a, frame, again, is, called, deinterlacing., With, progressive, devices, such, as, PC, monitors, two, fields, will, become, converted, to, a, frame, first, and, then, all, lines, of, the, frame, (1,, 2,, 3,, 4,, etc.), will, be, written., 50, fields/s, (interlaced), will, become, 25, fps, (progressive)., Using, a, special, deinterlacing, we, achieve, 50, fps, from, 50, fields/s, input, since, in, each, field, the, missing, lines, will, be, interpolated., For, the, sake, of, brevity, we, will, not, discuss, several, deinterlacing, methods, like, Blend,, Weave,, Discard,, Motion, Blur,, Bob,, Progressive, Scan, or, Motion, Compensation., 4.1, FILM-PAL-NTSC-Transfer, We, begin, with, "FILM", in, the, center, of, the, diagram, (fig., 2)., Film, material, is, shot, in, 24, fps., A, film, frame, is, nominally, displayed, for, 1/24, s, ≈, 41.67, ms., One, second, of, the, film, contains, 24, frames, and, will, be, disassembled, ("telecined"), into, 48, fields., For, the, transfer, onto, PAL, the, film, is, simply, accelerated., PAL, needs, 50, fields/s., Two, fields, (℘, -, n1, and, n2), of, the, 2nd, second, of, the, film, are, still, "pressed", into, the, first, second, -, marked-off, with, the, red, dotted, line, -, of, the, PAL, video., Thus, the, so-called, PAL, Speedup, emerges., PAL, films, are, played, 25/24, ≈, 4,167, %, faster, than, the, original, film, in, the, cinema., We, can, also, say, that, the, PAL, length, is, 24/25, times, longer, compared, to, the, original, film., That, means, that, the, PAL, length, is, 4, %, shorter., Due, to, the, acceleration, of, the, film, some, people, notice, that, the, tone, pitch, is, increased, with, PAL, films., Two, fields, are, displayed, within, 1/25, s, =, 40, ms., 50, fields/s, are, needed, for, an, interlaced, display, and, these, fields, will, be, shown, in, the, order, a1,, a2,, b1,, b2,, etc., Concerning, a, progressive, display, the, fields, will, be, added, up, first, and, then, displayed, in, 25, fps, (a1+a2,, b1+b2,, c1+c2,, etc.)., In, the, case, of, a, progressive, display, with, 50, fps, each, field, is, converted, into, one, frame, by, adding, missing, lines, of, each, field, due, to, special, deinterlacing., Thus, a1,, a2,, b1,, b2,, etc., become, A1,, A2,, B1,, B2,, etc., The, transfer, from, film, to, NTSC, is, a, more, complicated, matter., In, the, chart, (fig., 1), we, recognize, that, the, "x2, field", already, overlaps, the, first, second, (ℵ, -, x2)., The, NTSC, refresh, rate, is, 29.97, fps, corresponding, to, 59.94, fields/s., We, note, that, there, are, not, 60, but, 59.94, fields, per, second, transferred., The, first, two, fields, (a1,, a2), are, displayed, in, 1/29.97, s, ≈, 33.37, ms., The, three, following, fields, are, displayed, in, 1/19.98, s, ≈, 50.05, ms., Together, the, result, for, the, first, five, fields, is, approx., 83.42, ms, which, represents, a, deceleration, compared, to, the, first, two, film, frames, (2*41.67, ms, =, 83.34, ms)., The, film, frames, A, and, B, are, displayed, approx., 0.08, ms, longer, in, the, NTSC, television., The, following, section, "telecining", describes, the, achievement, of, 59.94, fields/s, from, 24, fps, film, material., 4.2, The, Telecine, technic, (Telecining), Normal, motion, picture, films, are, shot, in, 24, fps, on, 35, mm, film, material., Many, output, devices, like, conventional,, old, televisions, need, an, interlaced, signal, the, preservation, of, which, is, provided, by, the, Telecine, procedure., That, is, frames, are, converted, into, fields., With, PAL, a, frame, is, converted, into, two, fields, or, 25, frames, are, converted, into, 50, fields, within, a, second, respectively., With, NTSC, the, film, master, is, decelerated, to, 23.976, fps, [to, be, more, exact:, 24*(1000/1001), =, 23.9760239760239760..., ≈, 23.976, (concerning, this, refer, an, explanation, for, the, NTSC-Standard, in, the, text, above)]., Using, the, 2:3-Pulldown, 59.94, fields/s, are, attained, from, 23.976, fps., This, procedure, alternatingly, gives, two, and, then, three, fields, from, the, respective, frames., First, two, fields, (a1,, a2), of, frame, A, are, produced, and, afterwards, three, fields, (b1,, b2,, b1), of, frame, B, etc., Mathematically, illustrated, "2.5, fields, per, film, frame", are, transferred., If, the, film, master, is, already, slowed, down,, 23.976, whole, pictures, per, second, become, 11.988*2, +, 11.988*3, =, 59.94, half-images, per, second, whereby, [23.976/2, =, 11.988]., The, display, speed, in, NTSC, television, is, about, 0.1, %, [23.976, fps/24, fps, =, 0.999], smaller, than, in, the, original, film., We, can, also, say, that, the, NTSC, film, length, is, 24/23.976, ≈, 1.001, times, the, original, film, length., We, recognize, the, fields, a1, and, a2, generating, the, first, frame, A, while, the, fields, b1, and, b2, generate, the, second, frame, B., But, the, following, fields, b1, and, c2, generate, neither, frame, B, nor, frame, C., If, objects, of, the, film, move, during, these, two, fields, comb, artifacts, and, frayed, picture, edges, could, appear., Since, fields, are, repeated, in, NTSC, television, the, picture, -, roughly, speaken, -, changes, between, "fast, and, slow, sections"., The, consequence, is, a, jerky, sequence, of, screens,, the, so-called, "Motion, Judder"., 4.3, Inverse, Telecine, (IVTC), Inverse, Telecine, is, the, process, undoing, the, Telecining., On, NTSC, the, additionally, inserted, fields, are, removed, by, IVTC, whereby, 59.94, fields/s, or, 29.97, fps, respectively, are, transformed, again, to, 23.976, fps., As, two, top, or, bottom, fields, cannot, be, written, one, behind, the, other, the, fields, must, always, be, present, in, the, order, top,, bottom,, top,, bottom,, etc., During, the, IVTC, the, fields, are, sorted., Thus, the, c1, field, is, arranged, before, the, c2, field, which, can, be, seen, in, the, part, "IVTC, (1)", of, the, diagram, above, -, in, contrast, to, the, situation, after, the, 2:3-Pulldown., The, surplus, fields, are, also, removed, by, performing, another, type, of, the, IVTC., But, this, time, a, whole,, compound, frame, is, additionally, duplicated., Each, fourth, frame, is, represented, twice:, e., g., the, compound, fourth, frame, D, is, twice, displayed., Again, frame, H, is, displayed, twice, after, 4, frames,, etc., This, procedure, has, the, consequence, that, a, refresh, rate, of, 29.97, fps, adjusts, itself., This, differs, from, the, film, material, after, 2:3-Pulldown, in, the, way, that, all, fields, are, played, in, the, correct, order, but, a, compound, frame, is, displayed, twice, (see, "IVTC, (2)", in, the, diagram, above)., After, the, IVTC, the, pictures, are, in, a, progressive, condition, and, they, are, no, longer, "telecined"., Genuine, interlaced, video, material, should, not, pass, an, IVTC, process, since, putting, fields, together, -, recorded, at, different, times, -, is, not, recommended., IVTC, should, be, accomplished, for, optimal, results, only, if, the, source, which, was, divided, into, half-images, is, genuine, 24, fps, film, material, or, genuine, progressive, material., 4.4, Overview, of, the, refresh, rates, Overview, of, the, frame, rates,, refresh, rates,  , medium, type, frame, rate,, refresh, rate, converter,

comments, at, the, end, of, this, document., 5.1, MPEG, (Moving, Picture, Experts, Group),, Layer, and, Picturetypes, Coming, soon., Read, this, chapter, in, German., 5.2, MPEG-2, and, T_F_F/R_F_F/FPS, Flags, The, format, MPEG-2, is, used, for, Video, DVDs., In, the, MPEG-2, stream, the, video, material, is, not, stored, "telecined", since, we, would, have, double, fields, on, NTSC, only, wasting, memory, capacity., MPEG-2, offers, an, intelligent, solution, for, programming, flags., Contrary, to, NTSC, VHS, and, television, no, redundant, fields, are, stored, or, transferred., Due, to, the, flags, DVD, players, will, set, the, double, fields, in, the, same, interval, as, a, "mechanically", produced, Telecine, process, would, have, added, them, before., The, T_F_F, (top, field, first), and, R_F_F, (repeat, first, field), flags, cause, the, fields, to, be, repeated, in, a, certain, order., The, top, field, (a1,, fig., 15), of, frame, A, is, displayed, first, (T_F_F, 1), and, the, first, field, (a1), will, not, be, repeated, (R_F_F, 0)., The, top, field, (b1), of, frame, B, is, displayed, first, (T_F_F, 1), and, the, first, field, (b1), will, be, repeated, (R_F_F, 1)., The, top, field, (c1), of, frame, C, is, not, displayed, first, (T_F_F, 0), and, the, first, field, (c2), will, not, be, repeated, etc., In, our, case, (fig., 15), the, T_F_F, sequence, is, 1100110011..., and, the, R_F_F, sequence, is, 0101010101..., This, procedure, is, called, 2:3-Pulldown, due, to, the, repetition, of, the, fields, of, the, accessory, frames, in, a, certain, order:, two, fields, (a1,, a2), of, the, first, frame, (A), and, three, fields, (b1,, b2,, b1), of, the, second, frame, (B), etc., Often, this, procedure, is, also, called, 3:2-Pulldown,, but, however, it, is, more, comprehensible, to, say, 2:3-Pulldown, if, starting, with, 2, fields, of, the, first, frame., The, setting, of, the, R_F_F, and, T_F_F, flags, is, not, sufficient;, more, precisely,, the, MPEG, stream, stored, on, DVD, is, actually, not, played, in, 23.976, fps, as, needed, for, NTSC., The, solution, is, simpler, than, one, would, first, assume:, in, the, videostream, a, FPS, flag, will, be, set., If, this, FPS, flag, is, set, to, 23.976, fps, the, DVD, player, will, recognize, this, setting, and, accurately, play, the, stream, in, 23.976, fps., 5.3, Video, Time, Code, Counters, and, Drop, Frame, Flag/Non, Drop, Frame, Flag, Video, time, code, counters, can, only, count, in, whole, frames., An, example, for, a, video, time, code, -, also, called, SMPTE, time, code, -, is, [01:42:55:23], denoting, [hours:minutes:seconds:frames]., The, NTSC, refresh, rate, is, 29.97, fps., That, means, that, one, second, of, the, video, time, code, counter, would, be, a, little, faster, than, the, real, second, of, the, film, (second, in, SI-System)., The, drop, frame, flag, or, non, drop, frame, flag, has, a, special, task, with, NTSC, video., At, the, beginning, of, each, minute, (except, zero, minutes, and, multiples, of, ten, minutes:, 0,, 10,, 20,, 30,, 40,, 50,, etc.), on, drop, frame, MPEG, streams, the, frames, 0, and, 1, on, the, video, time, code, are, passed, ("dropped")., So, this, procedure, will, be, done, only, between, integer, valued, minutes,, in, particular, 1,, 2,, 3,, 4,, 5,, 6,, 7,, 8,, 9,, 11,, 12,, etc., It, is, important, that, only, the, frames, 0, and, 1, on, the, video, time, code, are, passed, -, not, the, real, film, frames, 0, and, 1., For, example, the, video, time, code, jumps, from, [00:01:59:29], to, [00:02:00:02], instead, of, [00:02:00:00]., The, drop, frame, flag, is, set, to, synchronize, the, video, time, code, with, the, real, time., In, 100, min., real, time, 10*9*(2, [two, frames:, 0, and, 1]), =, 180, frames, are, passed, in, the, video, time, code, counter., The, video, time, code, counter, can, only, count, 30, whole, frames, per, second, at, standard, NTSC., This, yields, 180, frames/30s, =, 6, fps., 100, film, minutes, -, programmed, as, drop, frame, MPEG, -, are, also, displayed, accurately, on, the, video, time, code, in, 100, min., One, second, of, the, video, time, code, is, about, 0.03, fps, faster, than, the, real, NTSC, film, second, [30, fps, -, 29.97, fps, =, 0.03, fps]., Auxiliary, calculation:, 0.03, fps*6000, s, =, 180, frames., These, 180, frames, actually, compensate, the, frames, that, are, passed., Therefore,, non, drop, frame, MPEGs, would, display, 100, film, minutes, (real, time), as, 100, min., and, 6, sec., on, the, video, time, code., 6., PAL-60, In, the, last, years, the, available, televisions, are, usually, multi-standard, devices., They, can, display, both, NTSC, and, PAL, or, SECAM, signals., If, a, television, is, not, multi-standard, and, a, NTSC, DVD, is, played, at, a, PAL, television, there, also, exists, the, possibility, of, the, DVD, player, showing, NTSC, as, PAL-60., This, standard, is, also, called, "pseudo, PAL", or, "NTSC, playback, on, PAL, TV"., PAL-60, uses, the, color, coding/color, subcarrier, of, PAL, but, the, number, of, scan, lines, (525), as, well, as, the, refresh, rate, of, NTSC., However,, the, refresh, rate, is, not, 60, Hz, as, one, could, assume, due, to, the, notion,, but, 59.94, Hz., We, must, pay, attention, that, not, all, DVD, players/PAL, televisions, can, transmit/display, PAL-60., 7.1, Digital,

digital, terrestrial, television, system, in, Brazil., SBTVD-T, (ISDB-Tb), is, based, on, ISDB-T., The, difference, in, video, compression, is, that, ISDB-T, is, using, H.262, compared, to, H.264/AVC, for, SBTVD-T., The, corresponding, video, formats, are, represented, in, the, table, of, H.264/AVC., A, system, which, uses, an, 8, VSB, modulation, (8, Level, Vestigial, Side, Band), for,
