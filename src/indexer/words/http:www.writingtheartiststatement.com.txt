artist, statement, lies, in, the, authenticity, of, its, authorship., When, you, define, an, artist, statement, as, a, marketing, ploy,, it, effectively, undermines, the, sincerity, needed, for, a, convincing,, compelling, statement., We, humans, instinctively, know, when, something, is, done, with, care, or, not., There, is, a, resonance, of, the, cared, for, that, is, unmistakable., We, may,

fraught, with, land, mines,, and, they, simply, prefer, to, hang, out, in, the, country, of, the, Strictly, Visual,, or, Strictly, Musical,, or, Strictly, Performing., One, of, the, most, common, responses, an, artist, gives,, when, asked, about, an, artist, statement,, is, a, variation, of, "My, work, cannot, be, reduced, to, words",, as, if, words, were, evil, alchemists, ready, to, turn, an, artist’s, creative, gold, to, dust., One, way, to, work, with, this, resistance, is, to, tackle, it, head, on,, with, a, WRITING, EXERCISE., The, key, word, here, is, "exercise", —, nothing, too, serious,, and, something, you, can, throw, away, for, any,, or, no, reason, in, particular., So,, grab, your, writing, pad,, your, choice, of, writing, implement,, and, a, kitchen, timer., It’s, time,
