Boyle,, Dana, Spiotta,, Amy, Bloom,, Aimee, Bender,, Jesmyn, Ward,, Heidi, Julavits,, Hari, Kunzru,, and, many, others., David, Joy's, The, Weight, of, This, World, is, a, dark, and, moving, multi-generational, novel., The, New, York, Times, wrote, of, the, book:, "Bleakly, beautiful., ., ., [a], gorgeously, written, but, pitiless, novel, about, a, region, blessed, by, nature, but, reduced, to, desolation, and, despair.", In, his, own, words,, here, is, David, Joy's, Book, Notes, music, playlist, for, his, novel, The, Weight, of, This, World:, I, think, one, of, the, most, insightful, questions, a, writer, can, ask, of, their, characters, is, what, are, they, listening, to?, What's, their, favorite, song?, What, do, they, sing, in, the, shower, when, no, one, else, is, around?,   For, whatever, reason,, that's, always, been, something, that, just, sort, of, came, to, me, when, I, sat, down, to, write, a, story., With, my, first, novel,, Where, All, Light, Tends, To, Go,, I, could, hear, Townes, Van, Zandt's, "Rex's, Blues", the, moment, the, first, image, arrived., With, this, latest, novel,, The, Weight, Of, This, World,, it, was, an, album,, a, record, spinning, in, the, background, as, the, first, scene, unfolded., I, could, hear, the, Drive-By, Truckers', The, Dirty, South, deafening, from, the, speakers., Even, more, than, that,, I, knew, the, last, cut, on, that, record,, "Goddamn, Lonely, Love,", was, the, main, character, Aiden, McCall's, favorite, song., With, these, characters,, I, think, Drive-By, Truckers, make, for, a, fine,, fine, soundtrack., The, Truckers, capture, what, its, like, to, be, working-class, poor, in, the, South., They, write, songs, about, addiction, and, desperation, and, hopelessness, and, family, and, love, and, heartbreak, and, sadness., There, are, so, many, songs, that, encapsulate, the, lives, of, Thad, Broom, and, Aiden, McCall, and, to, have, the, characters, be, aware, of, that,, to, have, a, music, they, identify, with,, is, a, powerful, thing., Ultimately, what, I'm, saying, is, go, listen, to, the, Truckers!, So, here's, a, playlist, for, my, latest, novel,, The, Weight, Of, This, World., I, like, to, try, to, come, up, with, a, progression, of, songs, that, follow, the, narrative., These, aren't, necessarily, songs, I, listened, to, while, I, was, writing—some, are,, some, aren't—but, they're, songs, that, capture, the, mood, and, emotional, arc, of, the, story., Also,, I'm, going, to, do, it, a, little, different, this, time, around., Rather, than, explaining, anything, about, the, story,, I'm, going, to, pull, lines, that, serve, as, their, own, sort, of, explanation., Hope, you, enjoy:, Ryan, Bingham, "For, Anyone's, Sake", Memories, of, my, loved, ones,

"Chances, are, I, took, the, wrong, turn, every, time, I, had, a, turn, to, take., And, I, guess, I, broke, my, own, heart, every, chance, I, had, a, heart, to, break., And, it, seems, I, spent, my, whole, life, wishing, on, the, same, unlucky, star., And, as, I, watch, you, across, the, barroom,, I, wonder, what, my, chances, are.", Drive-By, Truckers, "When, The, Pin, Hits, The, Shell", You, can, lie, to, your, mama., You, can, lie, to, your, race., But, you, can't, lie, to, nobody, with, that, cold, steel, in, your, face., And, the, same, God, that, you're, so, afraid, is, gonna, send, you, to, hell, is, the, same, one, you're, gonna, answer, to, when, the, pin, hits, the, shell., Drive-By, Truckers, "Goddamn, Lonely, Love", And, I, could, find, another, dream,, one, that, keeps, me, warm, and, clean,, but, I, ain't, dreaming, anymore,, I'm, waking, up., So, I'll, take, two, of, what, you're, having, and, I'll, take, everything, you, got, to, kill, this, goddamn, lonely,, goddamn, lonely, love., Blaze, Foley, "Cold,, Cold, World", I've, tried, for, a, long, time, but, I, think, I, can't, win., I'd, do, it, all, better, if, I, could, do, it, again., Wherever, I'm,

Wallace's, The, Broom, of, the, System, will, find, this, novel-in-fragments, to, be, equally, irreverent, and, peppered, with, a, similarly, absurd, cast, of, characters., ., ., ., It, begs, readers, to, ask, what, seemingly, futile, details, mean, in, the, context, of, life, and, suicide.", In, his, own, words,, here, is, Max, Winter's, Book, Notes, music, playlist, for, his, novel, Exes:, Like, the, heartsick, teen, turned, record, store, asshole, I, must, still, be,, I've, spent, the, fifteen, years, it, took, to, write, Exes, also, making, mental, versions, of, this, mixtape., But, because, it's, already, hard, enough, for, someone, like, me, to, make, these, kinds, of, choices,, when, it, came, time, to, make, them, for, real,, I, had, to, lay, down, some, ground, rules,, like, no, diegetic, music—of, which, my, book, contains, a, fair, amount,, much, of, it, frankly, and, intentionally, awful,, not, to, mention, jarring, and, gross, when, actually, listened, to, in, the, order, it, appears, on, the, page., But, sadly, another, rule, turned, out, to, be, no, Providence, music,, as, most, of, what, fits, with, my, book, is, just, about, Internet-proof,, and,, for, me,, Providence, music, has, always, been, all, or, nothing., So, that, means, no, "Temptation,", by, (yes,, that), Sam, Lipsyte's, every-bit-as-hard-to-believe-then-but-for-different-reasons, Dungbeetle., (He, went, by, Sam, Shit,, and, wore, a, cape.), But, no, "Get, Up, and, Go", by, Thee, Hydrogen, Terrors,, or, Shanghai, Tang, covering, "Cracked, Actor,", either., Not, even, Six, Finger, Satellite's, "Man, Behind, the, Glasses,", which, was, absolutely, not, recorded, at, the, state, prison, as, the, 7", claims,, but, was, also, never, recorded, properly,, a, choice, which, may, have,, in, part,, led, to, the, guitar, player's, sudden, departure,, depending, on, who, you, believe., Fucking, Providence,, man., You, could, write, a, book, about, it…, And, so, in, the, end,, it, was, pretty, simple:, the, songs, had, to, sound, like, the, chapters, themselves., I, know,, duh., But, missing, the, point, at, first, and, making, things, harder, than, they, need, to, be, and, taking, the, long, way, around, and, getting, super, fucking, lost, along, the, way, has,, for, me,, always, been, what, it's, all, about., 1., "Side, By, Each", "Fear, is, a, Man's, Best, Friend,", John, Cale, While, waiting,, fearfully,, to, hear, back, on, the, sale, of, my, book,, I, pretty, much, only, listened, to, this, song—about, fear,, of, course,, but, also, about, waiting., Then, I, figured, it, out, on, guitar,, much, to, the, chagrin, of, my, wife, and, my, son., But, these, days, "Fear, is, a, Man's, Best, Friend", mostly, makes, me, think, of, Clay, Blackall,, simultaneously, damaged, and, sustained, by, his, fear,, like, that, duck, at, Roger, Williams, Park, that, had, an, arrow, through, it., Removing, it, would, have, killed, him,, but, he, wound, up, living, longer, than, anyone, expected., They, never, caught, the, archer., 2., "Aloha", "Heaven",, Talking, Heads, For, the, most, part, I, find, lyrics, to, be, unimportant—barely, even, hear, them—a, fact, which, only, someone, who, hasn't, played, in, rock, bands, would, find, surprising., Even, coming, from, a, writer., No,, all, that, matters, to, me, is, that, the, lyrics, don't, detract, from, the, music,, for, one, reason, or, another:, racism/sexism/homophobia,, general, idiocy,, "party", as, verb., Lyrics, are, like, sausage, casing,, or, whatever, essential, element, it, is, you, mostly, only, hope, not, to, notice, too, much:, contraception,, garlic,, acting., (That, said,, I, do, like, our, local, Saugy, franks,, where, the, unmistakable, snap, is, half, the, point.), But, these:, There, is, a, party , Everyone, is, there , Everyone, will, leave, At, exactly, the, same, time, may, very, well, be, the, best, lines, ever, written, about, the, hopeful, self-delusion, of, the, socially-anxious, drinker., In, this, chapter,, the, Judge, Reinhold-impersonating, Vince, Vincent, is, so, afraid, he'll, miss, something, that, nothing, itself, becomes, a, reasonable—even, desirable—alternative., Like, Nietzsche, says,, "Man, would, rather, will, nothingness,, than, not, will, at, all.", In, the, moment,, our, self-destructive, habits, have, a, way, of, making, perfect, sense;, we're, all, afraid, of, something., (Also,, every, Rhode, Islander, knows, that, Talking, Heads, are, a, New, York, band,, not, a, Providence, band,, so,, no,, they, don't, count.), 3., (…etc…), "The, 15th",, Wire, These, interchapters, are, where, Clay, searches, for, his, late, brother,, Eli,, and, finds, him, where, he, least, expects,, which, only, makes, it, harder, for, him, to, stop, looking, all, the, places, he, shouldn't,, like, we, do, with, lost, keys., "The, 15th", is, a, perfect,, impossible, song—at, once, stately, and, nervous—about, searching, for, something, that, turns, out, not, to, be, there, by, a, band, that, could, only, search;, could, only, ever, exist, in, a, state, of, becoming,, a, state, of, change., When, they, first, reunited, for, shows,, in, the, mid-‘80s,, they, hired, a, Wire, cover, band, to, play, their, old, songs,, and, they, just, played, the, new, ones—a, gesture, that, could, just, as, easily, be, called, perverse, as, its, opposite., But, the, worst, part, of, a, search, is, when, it, gets, called, off., The, only, non-hateful, word, I, won't, let, my, students, use, is, closure., 4., "Twinrock, Caretakers, Log", "The, Endless, Sea,", Iggy, Pop, It, took, me, way, too, long, to, give, New, Values, a, shot., But, only, because, The, Stooges, are, my, favorite, band,, and, because, Lust, for, Life, is, my, favorite, record, whenever, Fun, House, isn't., (Not, for, nothing,, my, wife, gives, me, endless, shit, for, calling, whatever, I'm, listening, to/reading/watching, at, the, moment, "my, favorite",, but, isn't, that, how, it, works?, Every, great, taco, is, the, best, taco, when, you, really, want, a, taco, and, you're, finally, eating, one.), But, goddamned, if, this, isn't, my, favorite, Iggy, song, right, now—one, that, evokes, Twinrock, Caretaker, Rob, Nolan's, mixed, feelings, about, the, sea,, increasingly, hard, for, him, to, separate, from, his, current, line, of, work., But, we've, all, done, things, we're, not, proud, of, when, we're, tight, for, the, rent., And, there's, a, reason, we, say, "afforded, me, a, view.", 5., (…, …), "Always, Crashing, in, the, Same, Car,", David, Bowie, Okay,, a, little, on, the, nose,, given, the, serial, car, crashes, described, in, this, chapter,, but, duh., Bowie, knows, that, a, song, about, driving, 94mph, in, a, parking, garage, must, be, slow., Because, if, it, all, hadn't, seemed, much, too, slow, then, you, wouldn't, have, felt, the, need, to, drive, so, fast., This, is, just, how, it, feels:, you, see, everything,, even, what, you, couldn't, possibly, see,, then, you, crash., 6., "Exes", "Oh!", Breeders, This, song, is, as, soft, and, warm, as, flesh,, as, gauzy, as, memory., You, can, hear, what, Kim, Deal, misses., It, recently, occurred, to, me, that, this, is, the, only, song, on, the, whole, playlist, recorded, in, the, ‘90s,, the, decade, during, which, most, of, Exes, takes, place., But, I'm, okay, with, it,, because, that's, the, whole, point,, no?, Plus,, if, anyone's, going, to, represent, then,, then, it, might, as, well, be, Kim, Deal,, whose, voice, is, so, clear,, so, honest,, so, completely, unmannered, that, sometimes, it, hurts., I, know, that, cracking, voices, are,, like,, a, thing, now,, but, Deal's, voice, cracks, for, real,, the, way, voices, sometimes, will,, and, for, all, the, same, reasons., The, song, doesn't, so, much, start, as, they, start, playing, it,, and, it, ends, in, much, the, same, way—like, it's, somehow, always, there,, just, waiting, to, be, sung,, so, for, two, and-a-half, minutes, they, do., Every, story, is, a, ghost, story., 7., (…, …), "Avalanche,", Leonard, Cohen, The, aural, equivalent, of, a, painting, where, the, eyes, follow, you., Even, the, guitar—more, typically, an, afterthought, for, the, actual, poet, Cohen—is,, here,, a, menacing, presence., Hell,, "Avalanche", even, earns, its, overwrought, strings,, the, falsest,, most, pretentious, kind, of, overdubs,, generally,, after, gospel, and/or, children's, choirs., And, his, singing!, You, all, but, look, away, from, that, hump., "What, rags?", You, think,, hurt., 8., "Louder, Than, Good", "Orion,", Metallica, When, I, was, on, tour, with, Songs:, Ohia,, after, an, odd,, sparsely-attended, show, at, Bennington—there, was, a, Hawkwind, jam,, and, the, whole, thing, nearly, got, shut, down, by, campus, police, when, Oneida, promised, a, free, radar, detector, to, whoever, got, naked—we, spent, the, night, in, an, 18th, Century, farmhouse, belonging, to, who, the, hell, knows., Right, before, we, turned, in,, our, host, mentioned, something, about, the, place, being, haunted,, which, might, have, been, a, joke, but, is, exactly, the, kind, of, thing, you, shouldn't, joke, about, with, Jason, Molina, ever,, but, especially, not, before, bed., Next, morning,, we, found, Jason, in, the, van,, where, he'd, been, since, four,, cranking, Master, of, Puppets, on, repeat., "I, saw, the, ghost,", he, told, us., Then, we, went, and, got, pancakes, at, the, best, place, for, pancakes., Jason, Molina, could, see, ghosts, and, not, sleep, and, eat, pancakes, like, you, read, about., 9., (…, …), "Waves, of, Fear,", Lou, Reed, The, first, time, I, dropped, out, of, college,, I, compulsively, listened, to, The, Blue, Mask—a, then-old, ten-years, old—and, only, three, or, four, times, to, Nevermind,, released, that, same, fall., I, don't, hate, guitar, solos, the, way, so, many, people, of, my, generation, like, to, say, they, do,, but, this, Robert, Quine, guitar, solo, is, the, greatest, guitar, solo, ever, recorded, precisely, because, it, does, the, exact, opposite, of, almost, every, other, guitar, solo, while, still, being,, identifiably,, a, guitar, solo., Hell,, I, even, love, the, corny, stop-time, part., But, that, bit's, pure, Lou., He, never, gave, a, single, shit, what, anyone, thought;, just, followed, his, first, impulse, wherever, it, led, him., Sometimes, it, worked,, and, sometimes, it, really, didn't—but, that, when, it, did,, it, did, so, perfectly,, was, all, that, mattered, to, him., 10., "Class, History", "I'm, Straight,", Modern, Lovers, Drugs, are, but, a, pretext, for, this, song's, larger, objections., Because, what, Jonathan, Richman, is, really, asking, is,, "Why, him,, and, not, me?", He's, hurt, and, angry,, but, mostly, confused., Like, Jacob, Deinhardt., Like, every, teenaged, boy,, on, some, level,, at, some, point, or, another,, whether, or, not, we'll, admit, it, now., We, like, to, talk, about, how, some, things, gain, importance, over, time—and, when, they, do,, well,, hey,, that's, just, great,, isn't, it—or, how, some, other, things, will, surely, lose, their, importance—and, that's, really, too, bad,, or, very, much, for, the, best,, depending—but, if, we're, being, honest, the, most, important, things, were, just, as, important, then, as, they, still, are, now., Point, being,, when, determining, how, we, now, feel, about, something, potentially, embarrassing, from, our, pasts,, we, oughtn't, disregard, how, we, felt, at, the, time., Or, as, Tobias, Wolff, puts, it, in, his, great, short, story, "Smorgasbord",, which, not, for, nothing, concerns, memories, of, high, school,, we, should, take, care, not, to, look, back, on, our, youthful, feelings, with, "wintry, smiles.", Because, this, kind, of, cynical, revisionism, is, the, exact, opposite, of, nostalgia, and,, as, such,, every, bit, as, poisonous., We, think, of, hindsight, strictly, as, clarity, at, some, risk., "There, was, nothing, foolish, about, what, we, felt,", Wolff's, narrator, reminds, us., Yes., We, were, no, fools, back, then., 11., (…, …), "The, Calvary, Cross,", Richard, Thompson, I, have, no, idea, what, this, song, is, about—at, least, not, from, a, lyrical, standpoint., Is, it, about, Christ?, Sadomasochism?, Is, there, even, a, difference?, Hell,, half, the, time, I, can't, even, keep, track, of, who, the, "you", is., But, musically,, I, get, it., I, think., What, I, do, know, is, there, was, a, time, when,, every, weekend,, I, would, leave, the, bar,, and, walk, to, the, practice, space,, and, play, this, song, over, and, over—with, the, most, half-assed, imaginable, approximation, of, that, lovely, B-Bender-ish, part, that, opens, it—and, sometimes, the, next, morning, I'd, remember, having, played, it., 12., "Jubliee", "Starless,", King, Crimson, It, probably, goes, without, saying, that, in, order, to, put, this, playlist, together, I, first, had, to, make, peace, with, the, unforgivable, self-aggrandizement, of, declaring, any, of, these, songs, reflective, of, my, book., So,, yeah,, "Starless…", Well,, why, not?, While, revising, this, chapter, for, the, next, to, last, time, I, must've, listened, to, it, thirty, times, in, a, row., It, helped, with, the, fight, scene,, and, with, what, followed., It's, the, kind, of, song, where, if, you, happen, to, get, distracted, by, something, else,, at, some, point, you, look, up, and, say,, "Wait,, is, this, still, the, same, fucking, song?", But, happily,, you, ask., Because, holy, shit!, (Also,, for, those, collecting, Notable-For-Their-Absence, Exes, Playlist, Perversion, Points,, every, Red, fan—who, may, or, may, not, also, be, a, King, Crimson, fan,, as, Red, is, pretty, much, the, Platonic, ideal, of, the, "Non-Fan-Favorite"—knows, that, there's, also, an, amazing, song, on, this, record, titled, "Providence."), 13., (…, …), "Providence,", Sonic, Youth, People, today, don't, know, or, else, don't, remember, just, how, hard, it, could, be, to, get, a, hold, of, someone, in, the, late, ‘80s., If, nothing, else,, this, song, continues, to, preserve, that, information, for, the, future., This, is, pretty, much, exactly, what, it, was, like:, "I'm, downstairs, from, your, window…, If, you're, up…, Pub., phone, booth., If, you're, up…", At, first, it's, about, needing, someplace, to, crash, or, maybe, grabbing, breakfast., Then, about, accidentally, throwing, something, important, out., It, sounds, like, Chinatown,, in, 1988,, but, it, also, sounds, like, 10:30, at, night, in, Providence,, Rhode, Island:, "Did, you, find, your, shit?, …We, were, wondering, if, you, looked, in, that, trashcan?, …Call, later,, bye.", 14., "Neoteny", "The, Kiss,", Judee, Sill, Judee, Sill, was, either, the, best, or, worst, case, scenario, for, your, substitute, math, teacher, or, babysitter., As, is, typical, of, Sill,, there's, a, lot, of, noise, here,, lyrically—Millennial, Christianity,, UFO's,, wait,, what?—but, the, musical,, emotional, signals, are, as, loud, and, clear, as, can, be., The, first, time, I, heard, this, song,, I, cried, and, I, cried., I, hadn't, even, known, I, was, sad., Maybe, I, wasn't., 15., (…, …), "I'll, Keep, it, With, Mine,", (Instrumental, –, Take, 9,, 1966),, Bob, Dylan, For, the, same, reason, that, people, have, a, hard, time, with, a, writer, who, doesn't, really, give, a, shit, about, lyrics,, some, are, also, surprised, by, that, same, writer,, a, lifelong, Bob, Dylan, fan,, having, no, opinion, whatsoever, about, the, recent, Nobel, win—and, a, writer, who's, listened, to, Dylan, sing, as, much, as, he's, listened, to, anyone, not, in, his, immediate, family, talk,, no, less., But, my, lack, of, opinion, has, almost, nothing, to, do, with, how, little, I, care, about, prizes—unless, someone, I, know, and/or, who, really, needs, the, money, is, up, for, one,, of, course,, in, which, case, I'm, rooting, harder, than, anyone., Nor, does, it, concern, the, whole, tedious, question, of, "are, song, lyrics, poetry?", No,, I, mostly, don't, care, because, I, happen, to, think, Dylan's, a, better, singer, than, he, is, a, lyricist., It's, all, in, his, phrasing—weird,, ever-shifting,, alive, to, the, unfolding, musical, moment, in, surprising,, inimitable, ways., We, can, disagree, about, Dylan's, ever-sketchier, pitch, and, timbre,, but, the, real, point, is, that, he, makes, even, the, opaquest, shit—everything, from, "confusion, boats", to, "jewels, and, binoculars, [that], hang, from, the, head, of, the, mule", and, "trainloads, of, fools, bogged, down, in, a, magnetic, field"—seem, as, specific, as, hell., Only, he, can, sing, lines, like, these, convincingly., His, lyrics, are, like, deep-sea, creatures, that,, when, brought, to, the, surface,, fall, apart;, his, delivery, is, the, pressure, that, shapes, and, sustains, them., So, we, see, what, he, sees,, feel, what, he, feels., Because, we, can, hear, him, seeing, it,, hear, him, feeling, it., And, even, here,, when, he's, not, there,, you, can't, not, hear, him., 16., "The, Quaker, Guns", "Final, Solution", Pere, Ubu, This, song, has, always, been, about, solving, problems, of, your, own, creation—and, not, about, the, Holocaust., It, also, happens, to, be, the, most, exciting, song, ever, recorded,, an, excitement, which,, amazingly,, has, as, much, to, do, with, the, bass, as, it, does, with, the, more, plainly, flashy, guitars, and, keyboards, and, drums, and, vocals, and, even, the, backing, vocals,, all, of, which, are, perfect., But, there, have, never, been, any, words, for, what, Peter, Laughner's, doing, here—that, triumphant, but, also, heart-broken, melody, eventually, rising, up, from, the, still-shocking, din., It, was, first, and, last, shot, in, the, studio, and,, in, two, years,, he'd, be, dead., How, is, that, even, possible?, Exes, could, just, as, easily, be, set, in, Cleveland., 17., (…, …), "Time,", Richard, Hell, and, the, Voidoids, Richard, Hell, is, at, the, top, of, the, list, of, famous, people—above, even, Hank, Greenberg, and, Lauren, Bacall—that, I, wish, I'd, known, were, Jewish., He, used, to, come, into, Venus, Records, when, I, worked, there,, sometimes, with, his, daughter,, who, pretty, clearly, thought, of, him, only, as, Dad., He, lived, a, few, blocks, away,, in, the, same, apartment, from, the, cover, of, Destiny, Street., He, still, lives, there,, I, think., Not, for, nothing,, my, book, starts, with, an, epigraph, by, Richard, Hell—not, from, a, song, lyric,, even, though, he, wrote, some, great, ones,, but, from, an, op-ed,, written, after, they'd, just, shuttered, CBGB,, where, he, and, so, many, like, him—though, who's, like, him?—got, their, start., (It's, an, expensive, clothes, store, now;, Iggy, models, for, them.), So, it, feels, fitting, to, close, with, Hell's, best, song., But, more, pertinently, this, also, happens, to, the, best, song, ever, written, about, time,, especially, as, it, relates, to, those, who, feel,, for, whatever, reason,, the, desperate, need, to, account, for, its, passage:, Only, time, can, write, a, song, that's, really, really, real , The, best, a, man, can, say, is, how, its, play, on, him, does, feel , And, know, he, only, knows, as, much, as, time, to, him, reveals, Anyway,, Exes, is, about, time,, about, how, every, time, is, many, times, all, at, once,, and, about, how, there, is, no, such, thing, as, a, single, point, in, it., Time, is, the, city, we, all, live, in,, and, we, can, all, see, our, old, house, from, here., Thanks, for, listening., Max, Winter, and, Exes, links:, excerpt, from, the, book, Publishers, Weekly, review, Fiction,

Christensen,, Lauren, Groff,, T.C., Boyle,, Dana, Spiotta,, Amy, Bloom,, Aimee, Bender,, Jesmyn, Ward,, Heidi, Julavits,, Hari, Kunzru,, and, many, others., Alex, Segura's, Dangerous, Ends,, the, third, book, in, his, Pete, Fernandez, books,, brings, a, broader, scope, to, this, compelling,, hardboiled, series., Duane, Swierczynski, wrote, of, the, book:, "Alex, Segura, is, one, of, the, most, exciting, and, vital, voices, in, crime, fiction, today,, and, his, Pete, Fernandez, series, is, keeping, private, eye, fiction, alive, and, kicking, (serious, ass), in, the, new, millennium., His, work, does, what, the, best, crime, fiction, should, do:, take, us, down, city, streets, we, wouldn’t, dare, visit, alone.", In, his, own, words,, here, is, Alex, Segura's, Book, Notes, music, playlist, for, his, novel, Dangerous, Ends:, Redemption., Facing, the, past., Regrets., Legacy., Rebirth., These, are, some, of, the, words, that, stuck, in, my, head, during, the, earliest, days, of, writing, the, book, that, would, become, Dangerous, Ends., I, knew, I, wanted, to, push, my, protagonist—washed, up, ex-journalist, Pete, Fernandez—forward, and, past, the, idea, of, the, drunken,, stumbling, private, eye,, and, that, would, involve, some, level, of, recovery, and, progress., But, the, things, we, start, to, see, when, we, begin, to, clear, the, wreckage, of, our, lives, may, very, well, frighten, us, back, into, the, caves, and, darkness., Those, were, themes, I, wanted, to, touch, on,, and, those, were, the, kind, of, songs, that, continues, to, pop, up, as, I, thought, about, the, book., While, I, can't, listen, to, music, while, writing, (I, find, it, too, distracting,, even, lyric-less, soundtracks, send, me, off, in, the, wrong, direction),, music, is, a, big, part, of, my, writing, process., It, happens, almost, on, its, own:, as, I, begin, to, think, about, and, craft, a, new, novel,, I, start, collecting, songs., I, replay, them, and, imagine, key, scenes, or, moments, from, the, still-percolating, novel., The, music, brings, them, to, life., Dangerous, Ends,, the, third, book, in, my, Pete, Fernandez, Miami, Mystery, series,, is, my, most, ambitious, piece, of, work., The, book, takes, a, different, narrative, approach—through, flashbacks, and, a, bit, of, time-hopping,, we, see, the, unfolding, mystery, from, different, perspectives., The, structure, (hopefully!), provides, readers, with, a, richer,, more, complex, look, at, Pete,, his, hometown, of, Miami, and, how, both, reflect, back, on, his, family's, roots, in, Cuba,, as, Castro, began, to, take, hold., At, the, same, time,, Pete, is, retooling, and, rebuilding—trying, to, create, a, life, for, himself, free, of, the, alcoholism, and, foolish, risk-taking, that, marred, his, brushes, with, death, in, the, first, two, books., He, only, half-succeeds., It's, in, those, gray, areas—when, you, know, you're, doing, something, wrong, or, longing, to, do, something, wrong, when, you, know, you, can't—that, I, found, myself, spending, the, most, time,, and, I, was, often, listening, to, songs, of, lost, loves,, regrets,, missed, opportunities, and,, sometimes,, hope, for, what's, to, come., "A, Hard, Rain's, A-Gonna, Fall", by, Bryan, Ferry, "Just, Like, Tom, Thumb's, Blues", by, The, Handsome, Family, These, two, Dylan, covers, couldn't, be, more, different., One, is, a, boisterous,, anthemic,, gleeful, and, ballsy, remake, of, one, of, his, most, well-known, tunes,, the, other, a, pretty, conservative,, if, a, bit, idiosyncratic, and, dour, re-do., Both, have, their, charms:, Ferry's, bombastic, vocals, and, Wall, of, Sound-ish, backing, making, you, almost, forget, the, original., Meanwhile,, The, Handsome, Family, manages, to, out-sparse, Dylan, himself,, which, is, equally, impressive., Like, anyone, facing, recovery,, even, the, most, familiar, things, can, seem, vastly, or, slightly, off, from, what, they, remember, before., "Hangin', Round", by, Lou, Reed, "You're, still, doing, things, I, gave, up, years, ago,", Reed, chastises, in, the, chorus, of, this, gem,, with, him, and, his, backing, band, in, top,, post-VU, form,, sounding, tight,, savvy, and, intentionally, wobbly., "Hangin', Around", almost, feels, like, a, Lou, Reed, Mad, Lib,, which, shouldn't, be, perceived, as, a, slight—the, song, features, all, the, DNA, of, a, Reed, masterpiece:, unforgettable, character, bits,, a, sly, narrator, and, the, hint, of, something, darker., An, ode, to, those, trying, to, move, past, their, mistakes,, but, still, haunted, by, certain, people, and, places,, much, like, Pete., "Bemba, Colora", by, Celia, Cruz, Dangerous, Ends, opens, up, in, the, past—flashing, back, to, the, early, days, of, Castro's, takeover, of, Cuba,, giving, readers, a, glimpse, at, the, legacy, Pete, must, carry, with, him, into, the, present., The, Cuban, experience, is, something, that, weighs, heavily, on, all, the, exiles, now, residing, in, Miami,, and, their, children, and, grandchildren., No, other, singer, better, personifies, Cuba—and, the, Miami, exile, community—than, Celia, Cruz., Her, electric, and, rhythmic, vocals, take, center, stage, on, this, track,, which, serves, as, a, rousing, dismissal, of, a, loose-lipped, ex-lover., Cruz, delivers, the, cutting, lyrics, effortlessly—showcasing, the, force, and, verve, she, would, become, known, for., "Question", by, Old, 97s, The, 97s, plaintive, and, finger-picked, ode, to, missed, moments, that, crop, up, during, the, early,, fragile, days, of, a, budding, romance, is, both, hopeful, and, sad,, in, large, part, to, the, singer's, quivering, vocals, and, simple, arrangement., A, short,, lean, song, about, taking, risks,, even, after, your, heart's, been, broken, more, than, a, few, times., "Nobody, Really, Cares, If, You, Don't, Go, to, The, Party", by, Courtney, Barnett, What, if, Oasis, and, Liz, Phair, had, a, baby?, A, free-wheeling, and, fun, tune, that, doesn't, try, to, be, more, than, it, is—which, is, pretty, great., The, relief, that, comes, with, acceptance., "How, to, Forget", by, Jason, Isbell, Isbell, often, sings, of, dark,, broken, romances, and, muddled, and, misguided, memories., This, song, is, no, exception., The, narrator,, now, in, a, happy, and, comfortable, point, in, his, life,, still, finds, himself, haunted—and, aroused—by, a, past,, combustible, romance., A, warning, that, even, though, our, demons, might, be, dormant,, it, just, takes, a, few, swigs, of, nostalgia, to, se3t, them, free—a, lesson, Pete, learns, again, in, the, pages, of, Dangerous, Ends., "When, You're, Alone", by, Bruce, Springsteen, A, somber,, blue, collar, ditty, about, struggling, through, the, ups, and, downs, of, life, delivered, by, the, master, of, the, genre., Not, sure, anyone, else, could, get, away, with, the, lyric, "When, you're, alone/you're, alone.", "Harlem, River, Blues", by, Justin, Townes, Earle, Earle's, song, celebrates, the, good, and, the, bad, of, life, with, an, impressive, and, raucous, burst, of, confidence,, rollicking, through, to, a, euphoric, climax., A, man, who, knows, himself,, facing, a, dark,, potentially, fatal, path., The, closing, track, to, the, book, if, there, ever, was, one., "All, This, Useless, Beauty", by, Elvis, Costello, and, the, Attractions, "She'd, be, tempted, to, spit/if, she, wasn't, so, ladylike.", The, reformed, Costello, and, the, Attractions, sidestepped, consumer, and, critical, expectations,, choosing, a, more, thoughtful, and, deliberate, approach, with, their, reunion, record,, of, which, this, is, the, title, track., Elegiac, and, somber,, the, song, starts, with, Costello's, spoken-sung, verses, and, builds, to, a, more, forceful, but, still, controlled, apogee., Part, story,, part, melancholy, ode, to, society's, failures,, the, song, works, as, you, want, it,, too—like, most, of, Costello's, best., In, this, case,, it, served, as, a, strong, reminder, of, Pete's, past, failures, and, missed, opportunities,, leaving, no, guarantees, for, a, brighter, future., "Never, Let, Me, Down", by, David, Bowie, Not, one, of, Bowie's, most, beloved, tracks, but, arguably, one, of, his, most, sincere,, this, soulful, ballad, evokes, the, rawness, and, unfiltered, emotions, one, feels, after, years, of, numbing, or, mind-altering, addiction., The, curtains, are, pulled, back, to, reveal, a, dangerous, vulnerability, with, a, well-worn, groove., "Blue, Pt., II", by, Waxahatchee, "If, you, think, I'll, wait, forever,, you, are, right.", Raw,, unadorned, and, hauntingly, melodic,, Waxahatchee's, dreamy, tale, of, love, is, deceptively, light,, with, a, rough,, obsessive,

is, a, collection, of, short, narratives, on, the, childhood, of, every, American, President,, from, Washington, to, Trump., Their, stories, are, told, collage, style, via, texts, appropriated, from, over, 300, sources, (children's, books,, pop, history, books,, and, scholarly, biographies)., Of, Forty-four, American, Boys,, Adam, Braver, wrote, about, the, book:, "In, Forty-four, American, Boys,, William, Walsh, limns, a, complete, series, of, cabinet, portraits, that, show, how, tales,, memories,, and, artifacts, create, the, story, of, a, life., But,, of, course,, these, are, not, just, any, lives., These, are, about, forty-four, of, the, most, ambitious, men, in, American, history., By, witnessing, their, childhood,, Walsh, shows, when, the, commonality, of, boyhood, mixes, with, the, seeds, of, idealism, and, determination—the, early, sparks, for, the, eventual, combustion, that, will, create, something, larger, than, life., Forty-four, American, Boys, is, a, meticulously, crafted, collage, of, myth,, legend,, and, fact, that, tells, us, as, much, about, these, boys, as, it, tells, us, about, ourselves, as, individuals, and, as, a, culture.", And, Kenneth, Goldsmith, wrote:,  "It, is, said, that, at, the, heart, of, every, cliché, lies, a, grain, of, truth., Each, line, of, this, book, flickers, between, cliché, and, truth,, at, turns, inspiring, and, insipid,, a, device, that, propels, a, searing, political, critique., William, Walsh, demonstrates, that,, when, done, well,, the, selection, and, arrangement, of, previously, existing, texts, can, result, in, fabulously, original, literature.", In, his, own, words,, here, is, William, Walsh's, Book, Notes, music, playlist, for, his, book, Forty-four, American, Boys:, This, is, a, one-song, playlist:, Paul, Simon’s, “American, Tune,”, from, his, 1973, album, There, Goes, Rhymin’, Simon., It’s, an, appropriate, song, for, a, book, of, appropriated, texts, on, the, childhood, of, the, forty-four, American, Presidents, because, Simon, appropriated, the, melody, from, Bach’s, St., Matthew’s, Passion, (1727),, which, Bach, had, appropriated, from, a, secular, German, song, called, "Mein, G'müt, ist, mir, verwirret,", written, a, hundred, years, earlier, by, Hans, Leo, Hassler., The, melody, is, simple, but, stirring., It, rises, quietly, and, falls, just, as, quietly., Though, Simon, wrote, the, lyrics, as, a, meditation, on, the, times—the, war, in, Vietnam,, Watergate—it, seems, to, speak, to, current, events, in, America, and, to, how, I, feel, today, (“…forsaken…misused…weary, to, my, bones”)., The, tone, of, the, lyrics, is, that, of, resignation,, loss, (“When, I, think, of, the, road, we're, traveling, on, /, I, wonder, what's, gone, wrong”),, and,, finally,, surrender, (“You, can’t, be, forever, blessed, /, Still,, tomorrow’s, going, to, be, another, working, day, /, And, I’m, trying, to, get, some, rest”)., This, book,, Forty-four, American, Boys,, is, not, political., My, intention, was, to, look, at, how, the, childhood, of, each, of, our, Presidents, was, portrayed, over, the, years,, to, see, what, it, was, about, these, boys, that, landed, them, in, the, White, House., Some, of, these, boys, came, from, wealthy, families, (both, Roosevelts,, Kennedy,, the, Bushes), and, others, were, raised, in, poverty, (Andrew, Jackson,, James, Garfield,, Ronald, Reagan)., Some, were, great, readers, (Thomas, Jefferson,, Abe, Lincoln,, Warren, Harding), and, others, struggled, as, young, learners, (Andrew, Johnson,, Donald, Trump)., Some, Presidents, were, never, even, elected, (William, Henry, Harrison,, Millard, Fillmore,, Chester, Arthur,, Gerald, Ford)., What, I, discovered,, in, some, books,, were, boyhood, narratives, fashioned, to, fit, the, office., The, authors, found, in, their, subjects, qualities, that, best, represented, a, President, of, the, United, States., What, makes, their, boyhood, stories, interesting, on, the, whole, is, the, way, they, reflect, our, history., Not, the, history, that, some, of, these, Presidents, went, on, to, make,, but, the, history, they, lived, through, as, children., We, are, all, living, through, some, history, right, now,, tremendously, bad, history., But, America, will, likely, live, through, another, forty-four, Presidents, over, the, next, two, hundred, plus, years., Some, of, those, Presidents, will, be, great, and, make, us, all, feel, great, about, our, country., And, a, few, of, them, will, suck, disastrously., Getting, back, to, Paul, Simon’s, “American, Tune,”, I’d, like, to, hear, something, other, than, surrender., The, opposite, of, surrender., Maybe, if, I, play, it, again, and, listen, harder,, I’ll, hear, it., William, Walsh, and, Forty-four, American, Boys, links:, excerpt, from,

Jesmyn, Ward,, Heidi, Julavits,, Hari, Kunzru,, and, many, others., Winner, of, the, 2016, Autumn, House, Press, Fiction, Contest,, Andrew, Bourelle's, novel, Heavy, Metal, is, a, propulsive, and, exciting, debut., William, Lychak, wrote, of, the, book:, "A, real, gut-punch, of, a, novel,, Heavy, Metal, sings, with, energy, and, beauty, and, honest, abandon, about, grief, and, hope, and, trying, to, find, one’s, balance, in, an, unsteady, world.", In, his, own, words,, here, is, Andrew, Bourelle's, Book, Notes, music, playlist, for, his, debut, novel, Heavy, Metal:, Heavy, Metal, follows, a, week, in, the, life, of, a, teenage, boy, growing, up, in, the, Midwest, in, the, late, 1980s., The, title, refers, to, the, music, Danny, listens, to, as, well, as, the, weight—both, literal, and, figurative—of, a, .44, Magnum, pistol, he, steals, from, his, father's, gun, cabinet., Danny's, mother, is, dead,, his, father, is, an, alcoholic,, and, his, brother, Craig, is, as, damaged, as, he, is., I, wanted, the, tone, to, be, like, a, metal, song:, dark,, heavy,, unflinching,, full, of, rage, and, sadness—with, a, touch, of, tenderness, to, go, with, it., I, grew, up, in, the, same, era, as, Danny,, and, I, listened, to, hard, rock, music, just, as, he, does., In, fact,, I, gave, Danny, a, taste, in, music, similar, to, mine, when, I, was, a, teenager., It, was, fun, to, include, references, to, songs, and, bands,, and, it, gave, me, an, excuse, to, find, old, songs, on, the, Internet, and, listen, to, them, again., I, don't, usually, listen, to, music, when, I, write,, but, I, certainly, had, a, soundtrack, in, mind, as, I, was, composing, the, novel., Here, are, some, of, the, songs, that, make, up, my, playlist, (or,, to, use, '80s, terminology,, my, mix, tape), for, Heavy, Metal., "Fade, to, Black", by, Metallica, Early, in, the, novel,, Danny, and, his, older, brother, Craig, are, cruising, around, late, at, night, in, Craig's, Nova,, listening, to, Metallica's, album, Ride, the, Lightning., I, don't, think, Danny, mentions, the, song, by, name,, but, he, wonders, a, few, pages, later, if, death, is, like, the, Metallica, song, where, everything, just, goes, black., The, song, is, sad, and, slow,, or, at, least, starts, out, slow, before, getting, heavy., It's, probably, my, favorite, Metallica, song—the, pain, it, expresses, is, heartwrenching., "Hells, Bells", by, AC/DC, The, first, cassette, I, ever, bought, was, AC/DC's, Back, in, Black,, a, choice, I, remain, proud, of., In, my, opinion,, it's, the, greatest, rock, and, roll, album, of, all, time., My, favorite, is, "Hells, Bells,", which, is, spooky, and, ominous., The, line, "You're, only, young,, but, you're, gonna, die", is, a, brutal, lyric,, especially, sung, in, the, raspy, growl, of, Brian, Johnson., Talk, about, hopelessness., The, line, could, have, been, an, epigraph, for, the, novel., There, is, a, scene, in, the, book, where, a, group, of, teenagers, are, down, at, the, river, late, at, night,, drinking, around, a, fire, barrel,, and, this, song, comes, on, the, radio., I, had, to, include, it., It's, my, favorite, song, off, the, first, album, I, loved., "Don't, Know, What, You, Got, Till, It's, Gone", by, Cinderella, Early, in, the, book,, Danny, develops, a, romantic, relationship, with, a, girl, from, school, named, Beth., The, first, time, he, goes, to, her, house,, they're, both, nervous, and, don't, know, what, to, say,, so, they, take, turns, picking, songs, to, play, for, each, other., In, the, early, drafts, of, the, novel,, I, had, a, lot, of, song, references, here,, as, they, go, back, and, forth, selecting, songs., I, thought, the, barrage, of, references, were, a, little, overwhelming,, so,, in, the, final, manuscript,, I, focused, on, this, song, by, Cinderella., Beth's, taste, veers, a, little, more, toward, hair, metal, than, Danny's,, so, it's, appropriate, that, she, picks, a, ballad., But, it, changes, the, mood, between, them., She, selected, it, without, thinking, about, Danny's, dead, mother,, and, once, she, plays, it,, the, positive, vibe, they're, sharing, turns, uncomfortable., "Rock, of, Ages", by, Def, Leppard, The, novel, mentions, Def, Leppard, a, couple, times,, but, never, any, specific, songs., There's, a, scene, where, Danny, and, his, friends, are, sitting, around, the, lunch, table, debating, the, greatest, albums, of, all, time., Someone, mentions, Def, Leppard's, Hysteria, and, someone, else, cracks,, "That's, not, even, Def, Leppard's, best, album.", That's, me, as, the, author, injecting, my, perspective, on, the, subject., Hysteria, was, a, huge, album, in, the, 1980s,, catapulting, Def, Leppard, to, worldwide, stardom,, but,, for, my, money,, Pyromania, is, a, better, album., The, band, is, younger,, and, the, music, is, more, raw,, more, energetic,, more, …, metal., "Rock, of, Ages", is, the, best, song,, and, it's, about, living, for, the, moment,, burning, out,, not, fading, away—which, fits, thematically, in, the, novel., There, is, a, scene, where, Danny, is, watching, Headbangers, Ball, on, MTV,, and, a, Def, Leppard, song, comes, on., I, don't, mention, a, specific, song,, but,, in, my, mind,, it's, this, one., "Out, in, the, Cold", by, Judas, Priest, Judas, Priest, was, my, favorite, band, in, the, late, 1980s., I, had, more, of, their, cassettes, than, any, other, band,, even, AC/DC., This, song, is, a, little, different, than, most, Priest, songs., It's, a, bit, gentler,, focusing, on, heartbreak,, which, might, be, common, subject, matter, for, most, bands, but, not, Judas, Priest., It, has, a, slow, synthesizer, intro, that, my, brother, and, I, used, to, whistle, when, we, cruised, around, in, his, car,, which, had, no, radio., The, song, is, from, the, perspective, of, a, man, with, a, broken, heart,, but, Danny, makes, the, observation, that, the, song, "works, for, a, dead, mom, too.", At, one, point, in, the, novel,, Danny, remembers, the, night, after, his, mother's, funeral, when, he, was, having, a, breakdown., Craig, calms, him, by, singing, this, song, to, him,, which, is, perfect, because, Danny, spends, much, of, his, time, in, the, book, literally, outside, in, the, cold., "Seventh, Son, of, a, Seventh, Son", by, Iron, Maiden, In, the, very, first, scene, in, the, book,, Craig, walks, into, the, house, wearing, an, Iron, Maiden, concert, tee, shirt., The, description, is, from, the, Seventh, Son, of, a, Seventh, Son, record,, where, Eddie,, the, ghoulish, creature, on, all, Iron, Maiden's, albums, and, memorabilia,, is, floating, above, an, icy, sea., He's, holding, some, kind, of, unborn, offspring,, still, in, a, placental, sack,, still, connected, to, him, via, umbilical, cord., I, chose, the, picture, over, all, the, available, Iron, Maiden, imagery, because, it's, suggestive, of, family, lineage., What, horrors, has, Danny, inherited, from, his, own, family?, This, album, and, The, Number, of, the, Beast, are, my, favorite, Iron, Maiden, albums., I, managed, to, work, in, references, to, both, of, them., "Beth", by, Kiss, This, is, going, to, sound, cheesy,, but, here, goes., For, most, of, the, character, names, in, the, novel,, I, didn't, give, much, thought., I, used, whatever, popped, into, my, head., The, one, exception, was, Danny's, romantic, interest—Beth., I, chose, her, name, because, of, the, slow, piano, ballad, by, Kiss., I, thought,, "What, girl's, name, could, be, more, metal, than, Beth?", "I, Love, Sex, (And, Rock, and, Roll)", by, Wendy, O., Williams, I, think, most, of, the, band, and, song, references, in, Heavy, Metal, aren't, too, obscure,, but, Wendy, O., Williams, wasn't, nearly, as, well, known, as, the, other, artists, on, this, list., She, came, from, a, punk-metal, band, called, the, Plasmatics, and, sang, in, a, hoarse,, nasal, snarl., She, had, a, mohawk,, performed, concerts, with, nothing, on, but, underpants, and, electrical, tape, over, her, nipples,, and, was, known, for, taking, chainsaws, and, sledgehammers, on, stage, to, destroy, TVs, and, cars., When, she, went, solo,, the, music, became, a, little, less, punk, and, a, little, more, mainstream, metal., It's, all, fun, to, listen, to., Beth, plays, this, song, when, she, and, Danny, skip, school, and, fool, around., "Set, the, World, Afire", by, Megadeth, Because, the, novel, takes, place, in, the, 1980s,, there, are, references, to, the, cold, war, and, the, nuclear, arms, race., The, threat, of, nuclear, holocaust, was, on, people's, minds, at, the, time., There's, a, scene, where, Danny, and, his, friends, are, listening, to, a, Megadeth, song, about, nuclear, war., I, don't, think, I, name, the, song,, but, this, is, the, one, I, had, in, mind., Later, in, the, day,, Danny, walks, through, a, field, as, it's, snowing, fat, gray, flakes, that, make, him, think, of, nuclear, ash., "Modern, Day, Cowboy", by, Tesla, Neither, this, song, nor, the, band, are, mentioned, in, the, novel., I, wish, I, had, mentioned, one, or, the, other., Tesla, was, the, first, concert, I, went, to, my, freshman, year, of, high, school., I, don't, think, all, their, songs, hold, up, over, time,, but, this, one, does., It's, a, song, about, adversaries, facing, off,, the, threat, of, violence,, the, use, of, guns, to, solve, problems—all, ideas, Danny, struggles, with, in, the, book., And, the, song, was, on, the, album, Mechanical, Resonance—a, great, title, to, use, in, a, novel, with, a, metal/machine, motif., A, couple, weeks, after, I, turned, in, the, final, manuscript,, my, wife, and, I, went, to, see, Def, Leppard, in, concert,, with, Tesla, opening., Watching, Tesla, perform, "Modern, Day, Cowboy,", I, thought,, "Dang, it,, why, didn't, I, reference, this, in, the, book?", Well,, at, least, I, can, include, it, on, the, playlist., Andrew, Bourelle, and, Heavy, Metal,

Real, World, (which, includes, contributions, from, Roxane, Gay,, Liz, Prince,, Sarah, McCarry, and, others), is, accessible,, informative,, intelligent,, and, entertaining., Kirkus, Reviews, wrote, of, the, book:, "A, progressive, antidote, to, the, ancient, teen, health, textbooks, that, mull, over, the, dry, basics, of, teen, identity, ., ., ., a, stellar, collection, ., ., ., An, embarrassment, of, riches.", In, her, own, words,, here, is, Kelly, Jensen's, Book, Notes, music, playlist, for, the, anthology, Here, We, Are:, Feminism, for, the, Real, World:, One, of, the, unique, things, about, Here, We, Are:, Feminism, For, The, Real, World, is, that, it's, packaged, like, a, scrapbook., So, in, addition, to, having, an, array, of, essays, exploring, myriad, facets, of, feminism,, the, anthology, also, has, things, like, top, ten, lists,, art,, comics,, photographs,, and, other, ephemera., Kody, Keplinger,, one, of, the, 44, contributors,, created, a, really, fabulous, playlist, in, the, collection, that's, worth, checking, out, not, only, because, of, the, song, selections, but, also, because, of, how, it, sort, of, captures, a, lot, of, the, feel, of, the, anthology, without, her, ever, knowing, what, the, pieces, look, like., It's, neat, how, an, anthology, where, contributors, all, worked, in, a, vacuum, managed, to, convey, so, many, similar, messages, and, feelings., While, I, didn't, create, a, specific, playlist, that, I, worked, to, while, editing,, I, did, create, a, number, of, playlists, that, captured, the, feel, of, the, book, and, the, sorts, of, things, I, hoped, readers, would, take, away., I, used, them, for, everything, unrelated, to, writing, and, editing, that, still, managed, to, spark, something, for, the, process,, even, if, it, wasn't, with, specific, intent., Worth, noting:, this, isn't, necessarily, a, "feminist, playlist."You, can, find, those, on, Google, and, frankly,, most, of, them, have, the, same, songs, on, them,, along, with, a, bunch, of, comments, about, the, songs, not, included., I've, instead, highlighted, specific, songs, that, reflect, themes, and, ideas, among, the, essays, in, the, collection., So, while, I'm, bummed, there's, no, Rihanna, here,, and, there's, no, Spice, Girls,, no, TLC, (though, those, ladies, are, name-dropped, in, at, least, one, essay!),, and, there's, no, Dolly, Parton,, I, needed, to, make, some, Hard, Choices., I, want, to, make, a, joke, about, how, it's, hard, out, here, for, a, bitch, (ty,, Lily, Allen), but...well,, looks, like, I've, made, the, joke, now, and, can't, take, it, back., "Can't, Pin, Me, Down", by, Marina, and, the, Diamonds, I, could, name, any, number, of, songs, by, Marina,, but, this, one, really, strikes, me, as, fitting, Here, We, Are., It's, about, being, unable, to, easily, "pin, someone, down"as, a, certain, type, or, attribute, an, easy, label, to, them;, but, it's, more, than, that, --, it's, about, the, tone, of, the, song,, the, way, it's, being, sung,, that, really, makes, this, one, fit., There's, a, tiny, edge, of, sarcasm, that, comes, through,, particularly, in, a, line, that, many, fans, find, to, be, really, disconcerting:, "Do, you, really, want, me, to, write, a, feminist, anthem?, I'm, happy, making, dinner, in, the, kitchen, for, my, husband.", Where, many, saw, it, as, Marina, rejecting, feminism, for, the, sake, of, traditional, gender, roles,, in, the, context, of, the, song, and, in, the, intonation,, it's, absolutely, clear, that, as, a, complex, female, human, being,, she, is, able, to, be, any, and, everything, she, wants, to, be., She, doesn't, need, to, reject, things, like, cooking, dinner, for, someone, else, if, it, fulfills, her,, and, it, doesn't, mean, she's, not, a, good, feminist, for, doing, so.*, I, can't, help, but, see, how, well, this, song, fits, with, many, of, the, pieces, in, the, collection,, but, it, especially, resonates, with, those, pieces, that, highlight, that, "traditional, femininity"is, okay., Constance, Augusta, Zabar,, for, example,, talks, about, being, a, trans, woman, who, loves, makeup, and, isn't, ashamed, about, it,, and, Jessica, Luther's, essay, highlights, the, ups, and, downs, of, what, it, means, to, be, in, a, long-term,, committed, relationship., "It", by, Christine, and, the, Queens, I've, been, preaching, the, gospel, of, Christine, and, the, Queens, since, I, saw, her, in, late, 2015,, and, It, is, one, of, those, songs, on, constant, loop, in, my, house., This, is, 100%, a, song, about, gender, identity, and, the, ways, in, which, people, are, boxed, into, one, identity, by, society, and, how, it's, not, up, to, society, to, make, those, choices, for, another, person., "No,, I've, got, it., I'm, a, man, now., And, there's, nothing, you, can, do, to, make, me, change, my, mind., I'm, a, man, now.", This, is, another, song, that, could, correspond, to, a, bulk, of, the, essays,, but, perhaps, Rafe, Posey's, essay, about, discovering, and, acknowledging, he's, male, and, living, as, his, true, self, is, one, that, really, pairs, well, with, this, song., I'd, also, pair, this, one, with, Liz, Prince's, comic, about, coming, to, terms, with, the, word, "feminism"and, owning, it, as, part, of, her, identity., "Giants", by, Matt, Nathanson, I, grew, up, on, Matt, Nathanson's, music., It, was, the, soundtrack, through, my, teen, years,, and, I've, followed, his, career, from, wayyyy, back, in, the, day., So, when, I, asked, him, out, of, the, blue, if, he'd, consider, writing, an, essay, for, Here, We, Are,, imagine, my, surprise, when, he, said, yes, ., ., ., and, more,, the, way, I, thought, about, how, my, teenage, self, would, think, about, how, I, got, to, work, with, one, of, my, favorite, humans, professionally, in, my, adulthood., Though, any, number, of, songs, by, Nathanson, offer, up, feminist, themes, and, ideas,, the, one, that, really, struck, me, and, one, that, I've, been, seriously, consider, getting, a, tattoo, in, honor, of,, is, Giants., The, song, is, about, how, much, better, our, world, would, be, if, we, were, able, to, ignore, the, ideas, of, one, side, vs., another, and, instead, embrace,, acknowledge,, and, respect, the, differences, that, exist, among, us., That, rather, than, being, made, small, because, of, those, labels,, we'd, be, made, into, giants., I, could, quote, any, number, of, lyrics, that, get, my, heart, in, my, throat,, but, the, one, that, really, hits, hard, is, "We're, only, hearts, and, bones, and, blood,, but, we, are, giants."Because, it's, really, and, truly, that, simple., Maybe, also, "Everybody's, scared, of, things, they, don't, understand, and, all, of, the, living, that, they, don't, do.", Would, it, be, cheating, to, say, this, song, pairs, with, Nathanson's, essay, about, why, he, as, a, straight, white, guy, needs, feminism?, Because, I'm, cheating, and, saying, that., But, more,, this, piece, also, cuts, to, the, core, of, what, Daniel, José, Older, writes, about, when, he, had, his, big, awakening, to, feminism,, while, also, tying, nicely, into, Siobhan, Vivian's, personal, exploration, of, experiencing, love, and, romance, after, first, choosing, to, reject, them, as, powerful, parts, of, one's, life., "***Flawless", by, Beyonce, (featuring, Chimamanda, Ngozi, Adichie), Perhaps, the, most, obvious, song, on, this, list, is, the, power, anthem, from, Queen, Beyonce,, but, I, see, it, not, only, because, of, what, it, says, about, the, power, girls, have., What, really, works, for, this, song, and, why, it's, included, is, because, of, the, very, beginning:, we, get, a, short, introduction, from, back, in, Beyonce's, days, as, a, member, of, "Girls, Time."We, hear, the, very, beginning, of, her, career, and, how, she, came, from, modest, means, in, Houston, to, go, on,, pursuing, her, artistic, career,, no, matter, what, got, in, her, way., For, me,, this, song, is, the, essence, of, Malinda, Lo's, piece, which, opens, Here, We, Are., She, talks, about, the, ways, her, grandmother, influenced, her,, even, if, she, didn't, expect, her, grandmother, to, label, herself, as, a, feminist., It's, also, about, the, books, she, read, as, a, child, opening, up, her, world, and, inviting, her, to, become, the, storyteller, she, is, today., I'd, also, lean, toward, including, Alida, Nugent's, essay, as, one, that, this, song, speaks, to,, too, --, her, piece,, which, is, chock, full, of, humor,, talks, about, how, she, wanted, a, nose, job, in, high, school, so, she'd, better, fit, in, with, her, white, suburban, peers., But,, when, she, goes, to, Puerto, Rico, on, a, trip,, she, discovers, how, beautiful, and, colorful, and, shapely, everyone, is, there, and, it, really, made, her, understand, her, own, uniqueness, and, embrace, it, as, flawlessly, her, own., "One, Chance", by, Modest, Mouse, I, love, Modest, Mouse., I, consider, them, my, "wall, of, noise"and, when, I, am, having, Feelings, Of, Any, Kind,, blasting, them, makes, me, feel, good, because, I, will, never, be, that, angry, or, loud., This, song,, though,, is, one, that's, unexpected, and, moderately, quiet., The, lyrics, speak, to, being, a, box, in, a, cage,, about, the, way, society, traps, us, into, different, molds, and, that, it's, up, to, us, to, make, the, difference, in, our, lives,, as, well, as, the, lives, of, others., The, last, part, of, the, song, really, nails, it,, though:, "We, have, one, chance,, One, chance, to, get, everything, right., My, friends,, my, habits,, my, family,, They, mean, so, much, to, me., I, just, don't, think, that, it's, right., I've, seen, so, many, ships, sail, in,, Just, to, head, back, out, again, and, go, off, sinking.”, As, a, whole,, I, hope, this, book, helps, give, people, the, buoys, they, need, to, hop, off, the, sailing, ship,, stay, afloat,, and, find, their, way, to, the, places, they, deserve., IS, THIS, NOT, CHEESY, AND, HOKEY?, It's, true,, though., And, I, found, a, way, to, shove, cheese, into, my, explanation, for, a, Modest, Mouse, song., (ducks), "Little, Plastic, Castle", by, Ani, DiFranco, I, think, I, first, heard, this, song, when, I, was, a, freshman, in, high, school, and, it, kind, of, changed, my, life., The, lyrics, that, did, it,, and, the, lyrics, which, make, this, one, fit, Here, We, Are,, are, these:, "People, talk, About, my, image,, Like, I, come, in, two, dimensions,, Like, lipstick, is, a, sign, of, my, declining, mind, Like, what, I, happen, to, be, wearing,, The, day, that, someone, takes, a, picture,, Is, my, new, statement, for, all, of, womankind."The, song, is, about, how, quick, we, want, to, box, people, in, and, take, every, single, thing, that, they, do, as, a, grand, statement, for, their, beliefs., DiFranco, says, that, doing, so, flattens, us, all, and, keeps, us, from, being, unable, to, become, fully, functioning,, messy, human, beings., "Bad, Feminist,, Part, 2"by, Roxane, Gay, is, a, reprint, I, got, for, the, anthology, and, obviously,, I, couldn't, pick, a, more, fitting, piece-song, pairing., But, even, beyond, Gay's, tremendous, essay,, Sarah, McCarry's, take, on, friendship, and, the, idea, of, not, being, "like, other, girls"digs, into, the, ways, that, we're, (female-identifying, people, primarily,, but, also, certainly, other, genders), socialized, to, believe, girls, are, all, one, kind, of, thing, and, best, to, not, be, befriended., I'd, also, easily, see, this, song, fitting, the, themes, that, Mikki, Kendall, talks, about, in, her, essay, about, how, you, have, to, find, your, own, feminism, and, that, making, a, judgment, about, how, one, person, practices, feminism, is, a, knock, against, the, movement, as, a, whole., More,, one, person's, feminism, cannot, and, should, not, speak, for, the, feminism, of, others,, particularly, of, communities, that, are, marginalized., *I, see, so, many, echoes, from, this, song, in, the, Marina, and, the, Diamonds, song, listed, first., "Bravado", by, Lorde, If, we, take, the, song, to, be, about, anxiety, and, fear, --, "I, was, fighting, off, every, little, thing, that, I, thought, was, out, to, get, me, down,, To, trip, me, up, and, laugh, at, me,, But, I, look, not, to, hold,, The, quiet, of, the, room, with, no, one, around, to, find, me, out,, I, want, the, applause, the, approval, the, things, that, make, me, go, oh"--, and, then, we, get, to, the, crescendo, of, the, song, "And, I, can, tell, you, that,, when, the, lights, come, on, I'll, be, ready, for, this,, It's, in, your, bloodstream,, A, collision, of, atoms, that, happens, before, your, eyes,, It's, a, marathon, run, or, a, mountain, you, scale, without, thinking, of, size,"then, it's, hard, to, ignore, how, this, song, could, fit, the, themes, of, many, essays, throughout, Here, We, Are,, including, my, own., I'd, also, easily, pair, this, song, with, Nova, Ren, Suma's, essay,, wherein, she, talks, about, an, experience, she, had, with, a, high, school, teacher, who, never, assigned, women, writers, in, his, excellent, literature, from, around, the, world, course., This, angered, her, and, set, her, off, on, a, path, to, discovering, the, amazing, voices, of, women, in, her, personal, reading, life., Perhaps, I, could, also, suggest, this, song, going, with, Shveta, Thakrar's, piece, about, finding, her, own, voice, and, Kaye, Mirza's, essay, about, how, her, faith, helps, her, feminism., "Stronger", by, Britney, Spears, Britney, Spears, is, a, queen, and, anyone, who, disagrees, can, see, themselves, out., This, song, is, such, a, power, ballad, about, self-love,, about, learning, how, to, be, herself,, and, how, her, past, self, helped, her, become, the, person, she, is, now., Her, independence, is, important, to, her,, and, even, though, she's, dealt, with, hard, stuff,, she's, taken, that, to, make, herself, who, she, is, today., Both, Wendys, in, Here, We, Are, deserve, this, anthem, for, their, pieces., Wendy, Davis, for, her, gut, punch, of, a, piece, about, how, sometimes, it, just, sucks, to, lose...but, you, get, up, and, get, back, into, the, game, because, that's, how, you, keep, on, playing., Wendy, Xu, whose, comic, explores, a, relationship, she, had, where, her, identity, became, a, fetish, for, her, partner, and,, from, that, relationship,, she, was, able, to, learn, how, to, value, her, own, self, and, identity, and, not, allow, others, to, take, it, from, her., "Extraordinary, Machine", by, Fiona, Apple, On, the, surface,, Apple's, song, about, an, independent, woman, could, easily, relate, to, many, of, the, essays, in, the, collection, and,, perhaps,, much, of, the, overall, tone, of, the, collection., But, this, song, very, specifically, talks, to, the, idea, of, living, one's, life, for, one's, self,, even, with, others, who, do, or, don't, approve., "Be, kind, to, me,, or, treat, me, mean,, I'll, make, the, most, of, it,, I'm, an, extraordinary, machine.", This, song, speaks, perfectly, to, Courtney, Summer's, piece, on, the, unlikable, female, character, and, the, way, we, judge, the, motivations, and, decisions, that, so-called, "tough"girls, make., Her, piece, says, essentially, the, song, does:, people, like, to, judge, a, girl, who, is, living, her, life, if, she's, not, doing, it, within, the, neat, lines, society's, drawn, for, her, and, yet,, she's, still, going, to, do, her, thing., I, also, see, a, lot, of, the, piece, Kayla, Whaley, wrote, here,, too, --, her, essay,, which, is, a, letter, to, her, younger, self,, talks, about, the, horrible, experiences, she, had, as, a, disabled, girl, in, a, wheelchair,, being, overlooked, and, being, told, she, "doesn't, count"as, a, person., The, letter,, which, speaks, to, those, hard, moments,, also, offers, up, those, incredibly, moving, moments, of, tenderness,, wherein, Older, Kayla, tells, Younger, Kayla, she, matters, and, she's, loved, and, to, keep, on, with, her, badass, self., Kelly, Jensen, and, Here, We,

Christensen,, Lauren, Groff,, T.C., Boyle,, Dana, Spiotta,, Amy, Bloom,, Aimee, Bender,, Jesmyn, Ward,, Heidi, Julavits,, Hari, Kunzru,, and, many, others., Kurt, Baumeister's, literary, thriller, Pax, Americana, is, a, brilliantly, imagined, satire., Sean, Beaudoin, wrote, of, the, book:, "If, there, is, to, be, an, American, peace,, it's, certainly, not, going, to, come, on, the, pages, of, this, lit, match, of, a, novel., Kurt, Baumeister, has, fashioned, exactly, the, old, school, pre-and-post, Bond, techno, X-travaganza, everyone, bored, with, explorations, of, the, Louvre, has, been, waiting, for., Pax, Americana, is, both, dark, satire, and, deeply, satisfying,, an, adrenaline, rush, that, runs, through, suspect, politics,, spirituality, software,, and, the, sacredly, profane.It's, a, blast., Buy, it, now.", In, his, own, words,, here, is, Kurt, Baumeister's, Book, Notes, music, playlist, for, his, debut, novel, Pax, Americana:, To, people, who, don't, write, satire,, it, may, seem, easy., It's, just, jokes,, right?, Or, not, even, that,, but, painfully, dry, demi-jokes?, Constant, irony,, mistimed, whimsy,, humor, too, smitten, with, itself, to, know, better., Yeah,, yeah,, the, world, is, a, mess., So,, what?, Always, has, been., Always, will, be., Tell, me, something, new., The, thing, people, miss, is, that, the, satirist, must, be, (or,, at, least,, try, to, be), funny, and, serious, at, the, same, time., The, balancing, act, can, be, extremely, difficult,, difficult, enough, it, usually, fails., To, do, it, effectively,, you, must, be, willing, to, look, at, everything—the, world,, its, things,, its, creatures,, and, most, of, all, yourself—with, something, like, love, and, contempt, simultaneously., Pax, Americana, is, a, satirical, take, on, the, spy, novel., Meaning, it's, both, a, mockery, of, and, an, homage, to, the, form., For, me,, there's, one, writer, of, espionage, thrillers,, and, one, hero,, who, tower, above, the, rest., The, writer,, Ian, Fleming;, the, hero,, James, Bond., Now,, I've, read, several, Bond, novels,, the, first, of, them, in, a, bunch, when, I, was, a, kid,, then, refreshing, my, memory, of, a, few, (notably, Goldfinger, and, From, Russia, With, Love), over, the, last, several, years., The, most, memorable, things, about, the, Bond, books,, other, than, Bond, himself,, of, course,, are, the, exotic, locals,, femme, fatales,, and, larger-than-life, nemeses, that, seem, to, fill, his, world., These, qualities, exist, across, the, books, and, the, movies., One, that, doesn't,, though,, is, the, music., The, Bond, song, has, little, to, do, with, the, Bond, books,, but, it, does, provide, a, bridge, between, Pax, Americana, and, my, playlist., "Live, and, Let, Die", by, Wings, Whether, this, is, just, an, incredibly, clever, fifty-plus-year, marketing, campaign, or, something, more,, the, Bond, songs, are, significant, to, our, culture, and,, at, least, for, me,, "Live, and, Let, Die", is, one, of,, if, not, the, greatest., From, the, wistful, vocals, and, gentle, piano, of, its, beginning, to, the, deadly, shamble, it, reaches, and, maintains,, this, is, an, epic, rock, song., The, first, of, two, classic, tracks, for, which, I, spent, time, deciding, between, the, famous, original, and, the, only, slightly, less, famous, cover, that, came, decades, later., On, the, face, of, it,, the, arrangements, seem, similar, between, the, Wings, version, and, the, cover, Guns, ‘N, Roses, did, a, few, decades, later,, and, the, overall, effect, the, versions, go, for,, barely, controlled, musical, chaos,, is, similar., Similar,, but, not, the, same., And, if, I, must, choose,, and,, indeed,, I, must,, I'll, take, the, original., Listening, to, the, two, versions, one, after, the, other,, you, get, the, feeling, Axl, scream-singing, the, words, acapella, would, only, marginally, add, to, or, take, away, from, the, Guns, version., McCartney's, version, on, the, other, hand, is, more, soulful;, ironically,, more, cohesive, and, rangier, at, the, same, time;, vocals, and, instrumentation, both, necessary, for, the, overall, effect., Comparatively,, G, N, R's, instrumentation, sounds, simplistic,, tinny, and, thin, in, a, way,, for, all, the, growling, of, Slash's, guitar., Maybe, it's, the, fact, that, Guns, were, just, too, far, beyond, chaos, as, a, musical, effect., Maybe, they, were, chaos, in, a, way, that, leaves, someone, else's, elegant, descent, into, musical, entropy, sounding, weak, in, their, hands., Or, maybe, it's, the, added, poignancy,, particularly, in, the, beginning, of, the, McCartney, version,, his, willingness, to, work, with, rather, than, overwhelm, the, music, that, make, his, original, shine,, still, after, forty, years., "Price, Tag", by, Jessie, J, (featuring, B.o.B), "Price, Tag", captures, one, of, the, ironies, at, the, heart, of, Pax, Americana,, but, more, importantly, America, and, humanity., Deeply, infectious, and, superficially, positive,, there's, more, beneath, the, surface, of, "Price, Tag", and, a, lot, of, it's, dark., "It's, not, about, the, money, money, money, /, We, don't, need, your, money, money, money, /, We, just, wanna, make, the, world, dance, /, Forget, about, the, price, tag, /, Ain't, about, the, uh, cha-ching, cha-ching, /, Ain't, about, the, yeah, b-bling, b-bling", Jessie, J's, delivery, of, these, lines, is, somewhere, between, careless, and, jaded,, pointing, to, a, reality, that's, confirmed, by, the, video's, dizzying, array, of, costume, changes, and, the, ubiquitous, "b-bling, b-bling", and, "cha-ching, cha-ching", we're, shown, in, spite, of, what, we're, told., Ultimately,, the, protestations, are, hollow., It, really, is, about, the, "money, money, money.", But,, what, isn't?, If, you're, trying, to, escape, hypocrisy,, humanity's, not, a, good, place, to, do, it., And,, despite, "Price, Tag's", hypocrisy,, I, guess,, or, at, least, I, hope,, Pax, Americana, has, some, of, its, attributes., I, hope, readers, enjoy, it,, that, they, get, swept, up, in, the, story,, enjoy, the, plot,, and, find, it, a, fast, read., But, I, also, hope, they, take, away, a, hunger, for, greater, truth,, even, though, that, hunger, will, invariably, prove, impossible, to, sate., "Perfect, World", by, Liz, Phair, Liz, Phair's, whitechocolatespaceegg, is, one, of, my, desert, island, discs., Though,, maybe, in, these, dystopian,, Trumpian, times, it, would, be, better, to, call, it, one, of, my, "post-apocalyptic", discs., Call, it, what, you, want:, There's, not, a, bad, song, on, whitechocolatespaceegg,, from, the, post-consumerist, grandeur, of, "Polyester, Bride,", to, the, lurching, madness, of, "Johnny, Feelgood", and, the, mysterious,, acoustic, kookiness, of, "Uncle, Alvarez.", But, the, track, I, come, back, to, most, often, is, "Perfect, World.", "No, need, for, Lucifer, to, fall, if, he'd, learned, to, keep, his, mouth, shut", is, the, payoff, line., That's, quintessential, Liz, Phair,, conveying, a, universal, truth, with, sardonic, simplicity., But, that's, not, all, there, is, here., The, song's, narrator, doesn't, have, to, be, Phair,, but, it, could, be,, and, certainly,, if, it, were,, the, irony, of, a, woman, as, beautiful, as, Liz, Phair, envying, the, "girls, who, live, inside, your, world…just, sitting, next, to, mortals, makes, their, skin, crawl", is, heavy., Ultimately,, the, song's, narrator,, whether, it's, Phair, herself, or, a, constructed, character,, feels, a, kinship, with, the, fallen, angel,, Lucifer,, in, her, realization, of, the, universality,, futility,, and, inescapability, of, envy., "Salvation, Serenade', by, Jehovah's, Wishlist, (featuring, Rake, Pennirex), Pax, Americana, opens, with, its, antihero,, Tuck, Squires,, on, the, way, to, work, at, the, U.S., Internal, Defense, Bureau, (ID)., A, sunny, November, morning,, and, Tuck, heads, down, Constitution, Avenue, in, his, green,, reptilian,, convertible, Epiphany,, top, down,, heat, cranked,, music, blaring,, the, stereo, system, putting, out, "Salvation, Serenade,", the, latest, from, an, entirely, fabricated, band,, Jehovah's, Wishlist., Their, lead, singer, being, an, equally, fabricated, figure,, The, Angelic, Assassin,, Rake, Pennirex., I, love, making, things, up—part, to, most, of, the, reason, I'm, a, writer, no, doubt—from, car, brands, to, fictionalized, movies, and, band, names,, actors, and, TV, shows., So,, it's, fitting, that, I, start, doing, that, on, Page, 1, of, Pax, Americana., I, imagine, Jehovah's, Wishlist, as, something, like, a, cross, between, a, Christian, version, of, Arctic, Monkeys, and, Creed's, nihilistic, alter-ego., "Crunchy, drums, and, martial, guitars", is, the, way, I, describe, them, in, Pax, Americana—so, basically, punked-out, Dominionist, fascism,, right?, And, who, is, Rake, Pennirex?, What, does, he, look, like?, I'm, thinking, lots, of, black, leather,, long, hair,, and, a, crazy-thin, moustache., And, he's, British,, definitely, British., "Made, to, be, Remade", by, Missionary, Situation, Reversal, The, second, of, three, fictional, songs, on, my, playlist,, parts, of, this, are, sung, to, Dr., Diana, Scorsi,, the, genius, computer, scientist, who, develops, the, "God, software", at, the, center, of, Pax, Americana., This, happens, early, in, the, book, and, it, closes, a, chapter., No, doubt, there's, a, cinematic, quality, here,, the, idea, that, the, characters, are, providing, soundtrack, to, the, novel., (See, "Live, and, Let, Die", above.), "And, I, can, still, hear, that, old, choir, of, angels, /, Singin', ‘bout, the, End, of, Days, /, And, I, can, still, hear, my, old, preacher, screamin', /, Screamin', like, the, wrath, of, God, /, Screamin', out, the, wrath, of, God, /, Made, to, be, remade,, ooh-ooh-ooh…", As, discussed, in, the, book,, Missionary, Situation, Reversal,, MSR,, is, a, "God, pop", band, that, Diana, mistakes, for, country., Which, horrifies, the, people, she's, with,, the, men, who, are, singing, to, her., The, song's, significance, will, become, clear, later, in, the, book,, but, in, addition, to, alluding, to, a, certain, locale,, it, touches, on, the, theme, of, gender, imbalance, (and, even, misogyny), in, many, of, history's, great, religions., "The, Man, Who, Sold, the, World", by, Nirvana, Pax, Americana's, villain,, or, antivillain,, Ravelton, Parlay,, may, be, my, favorite, character, to, write., So, much, of, Parlay's, world, is, either, comedy,, satire,, or, both;, but, when, I, try, to, think, about, him, seriously,, the, refrain, from, this, song, comes, to, mind., At, times,, I, can, almost, hear, it, when, I'm, writing, him., It, makes, me, sad., I, think, that, if, Parlay, could, hear, it,, too,, he'd, imagine, I, was, likening, him, to, Judas,, and, I, probably, am., This, is, the, second, track, on, which, I, debated, between, an, original, and, its, most, famous, cover., Yes,, Bowie, recently, died,, which, makes, it, sort, of, sacrilegious, to, choose, Nirvana's, version., But,, at, least, on, that, score,, Kurt, Cobain's, life, is, a, tragedy, that, stacks, up, to, any,, even, two, decades, after, his, suicide., I, like, the, instrumentation, of, the, Nirvana, version, better., Which, is, probably, just, an, example, of, more, organic, music, catching, up, with, the, trippy, studio, tricks, in, Bowie's, version., The, stripped-down, version, works, for, me., No,, Cobain's, not, nearly, the, pure, singer, Bowie, is, and, perhaps, this, is, another, example, of, personal, taste, trumping, good, sense., In, terms, of, having, a, distinctive, voice,, you, really, can't, make, a, case, that, McCartney, measures, up, to, Axl, either., "If, God, Will, Send, His, Angels", by, U2, Listening, to, this, song,, I'm, struck, by, how, significant, the, lyrics, are, to, me, and, how, important, they've, wound, up, being, to, Pax, Americana., This, shouldn't, be, too, much, of, a, surprise., Anyone, who, knows, me, well, knows, that, U2, are, my, favorite, band., No,, that's, not, cool, to, say, these, days,, and, their, last, album, was, a, bit, of, a, mess., Still,, in, writing, this,, I, actually, found, myself, pulling, the, entire, sheet, of, lyrics,, then, editing, down, to, what, seemed, a, reasonable, level;, which, still, amounted, to, about, half, the, song., Nothing, remotely, like, a, reasonable, level., "It's, the, blind, leading, the, blond, /, It's, the, stuff,, it's, the, stuff, of, country, songs", Pax, Americana, is, based, on, the, premise, that, America, swerved, right, under, George, W., Bush, (which, it, did), then, just, kept, going, and, going, and, going., And, there's, little, as, generally, right—and, mainstream, white—as, country, music., Now,, I, don't, particularly, like, country, music,, but, I, can, get, into, Bono's, lyrics, as, he, simultaneously, makes, fun, of, it, and, himself, for, going, down, this, road., Yet,, somehow,, he, still, manages, to, touch, on, the, fact, that, there, may, be, some, legitimate, soul, in, country., You, have, to, listen, deeper, into, this, song, but, the, country, music, theme, returns—"it's, the, stuff,, it's, the, stuff, of, country, song,, yeah, but, I, guess, that's, somethin', to, go, on"—, their, expression, different,, their, meaning, more, profound., Speaking, of, profound,, this, line:, "God's, got, his, phone, off, the, hook,, babe, /, Would, he, even, pick, up, if, he, could?", Rather, than, the, presumption, that, U2's, lyrics, are, overtly, Christian,, their, lyrics, have, always, been, about, the, contradictions, of, faith,, the, push, and, pull, between, the, fraud, religion, often, represents, and, the, idea, of, actually, doing, good, in, the, world., Here,, most, of, a, verse:, "It's, the, blind, leading, the, blond, /, It's, the, cops, collecting, for, the, cons, /, So, where, is, the, hope, and, /, Where, is, the, faith, and, the, love?, /, What's, that, you, say, to, me, /, Does, love, light, up, your, Christmas, tree?, /, The, next, minute, you're, blowing, a, fuse, /, And, the, cartoon, network, turns, into, the, news", The, last, line, about, the, cartoon, network, turning, into, the, news, speaks, to, the, absurdity, of, reality,, and, the, plausibility, of, surrealism,, a, notion, that, seems, very, important, in, our, current, political, environment, in, America,, a, place, where, facts,, logic,, and, learning, seem, now, to, be, under, daily, assault, from, the, highest,, most, powerful, places, in, our, government., And, finally,, this:, "Jesus, never, let, me, down, /, You, know, Jesus, used, to, show, me, the, score, /, Then, they, put, Jesus, in, show, business, /, Now, it's, hard, to, get, in, the, door", Much, of, Pax, Americana, is, about, separating, religious, dogma, from, the, values, necessary, to, do, good., It's, about, the, absurdity, of, religious, fundamentalism, of, any, stripe., Though, there, can, be, no, absolute, certainty, that, one, of, the, extreme, fundamentalist, interpretations, of, religion, isn't, correct,, the, preponderance, of, evidence, suggests, that, no, fundamentalist, view, can, be, true, since, that, would, preclude, every, other, religion, being, even, a, little, bit, right., The, notion, of, an, omnipotent,, benevolent, God, that, so, many, religions, posit, would, seem, to, be, at, odds, with, the, idea, that, God, is, some, glorified, accountant,, keeping, score,, consigning, the, spiritual, failures—which, let's, be, honest,, is, most, of, us—to, an, eternity, of, torment., If, anything, is, true, about, religion, or, spirituality,, logic, dictates, that, beliefs, can, only, be, true, in, their, commonalities, (e.g., The, Golden, Rule)., This, is, what's, at, the, heart, of, Diana, Scorsi's, software,, Symmetra., "Lambs, to, the, Lord", by, Tabby, Arnesse, Tabby, Arnesse, is, the, last, recording, star, I, made, up, for, Pax, Americana., The, prototypical, young,, American, pop, chanteuse,, Tabby's, one, of, those, gratingly, ubiquitous, kids, who, seem, to, pop, up, (pun, unintended,, but, accepted), from, time, to, time., Here,, though,, I've, layered, on, America's, mélange, of, Christianity, and, capitalism, gone, nuts;, and,, voila,, a, uniquely, annoying, girlchild, you, don't, even, have, to, see, to, believe., This,, from, Tabby's, latest, #1, "Lambs, to, the, Lord":, "Oh,, God, is, love,, can't, you, see, /, He, rains, blessings, down, on, me, /, Like, lambs, to, the, Lord, /, With, fleece, as, white, as, snow, /, Someday, God, will, call, us, home, /, Someday, God, will, call, us, home.", "Lambs, to, the, Lord", is, set, to, the, tune, of, "Knick, Knack, Paddy, Whack", (aka, "This, Old, Man"),, and, shows, up, at, a, gallingly, inappropriate, time, in, the, text,, bedeviling, an, already, bedeviled, Dr., Diana, Scorsi, and, resulting, in, pained, singing, and, lumbering, dancing, from, a, certain, gigantic,, evangelical, henchman., "Born, in, the, USA", by, Bruce, Springsteen, Perhaps, the, most, misunderstood, song, in, the, history, of, rock, ‘n, roll—so, misunderstood, the, very, misunderstanding, is, famous—"Born, in, the, USA", may, be, the, best, example, in, this, whole, playlist, of, the, duality, of, intent, that, goes, with, satire., "Born, in, the, USA", has, to, be, anthemic., It, has, to, sound, like, a, sort, of, love, letter, to, America,, a, chest-thumping,, fist-bumping, apple-pie, buy-, Chevrolet, barbecued, chicken, of, a, song,, and, it, even, is, on, some, level., Its, true, meaning,, though,, as, a, song, of, men, who, gave, themselves, to, their, country, and, were, reviled, in, return, is, inescapable, if, you, spend, more, than, a, second, thinking, about, the, lyrics., "It's, the, End, of, the, World, as, We, Know, It, (And, I, Feel, Fine)", by, R.E.M., In, Melbourne,, Victoria,, a, little, more, than, a, week, before, 9/11,, I, saw, an, Australian, thrash, band, play, a, sped-up, version, of, this., It, may, have, been, the, most, exciting, (musical), two, minutes, of, my, life., Blundering, around, Oz,, smoking, and, drinking, and,, at, times,, playing, the, stupid, American,, I, had, no, idea, what, the, U.S., and, the, world, were, in, for, in, a, few, days', time., The, events, of, 9/11/01, are, certainly, significant, to, Pax, Americana,, just, as, they, are, to, history., But, for, that, attack,, America, would, have, gone, on, believing, itself, immune, to, the, terrorism, of, religious, extremists., That, didn't, happen, of, course., I, came, into, Boston's, Logan, Airport, on, one, of, the, planes, that, would,, a, week, later,, be, used, in, the, 9/11, attacks., I, lived, in, Boston,, so, there, was, no, chance, I, would, have, been, heading, to, New, York, on, one, of, those, fateful, trips,, even, if, I'd,
