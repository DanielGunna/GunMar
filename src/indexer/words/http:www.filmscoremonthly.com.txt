horror-comedy, hybrids, was HOUSE, (**½,, 93, mins.,, 1986,, R;, Arrow), producer-director, Sean, S., Cunningham’s, goofy, haunted, house, thriller, that, met, with, solid, box-office, returns, and, even, a, few, critical, kudos, when, it, was, released, in, February, 1986., Arrow, Video, has, produced, a, lavish, Blu-Ray, set, housing, the, high-def, debut, of, “House”, in, the, format,, along, with, a, massive, 148-page, accompanying, book, and, the, strange, but, fun, sequel, “House, II:, The, Second, Story.”, Comments:,   (read, on), Film, Score, Friday, 4/7/16, Posted, By, Scott, Bettencourt, 4/6/2017, -, 9:00, PM, The, latest, release, from, Intrada, is, an, expanded, version, of, Richard, Band's, score, for, 1986's, H.P., Lovecraft, adaptation, FROM, BEYOND,, director, Stuart, Gordon's, follow-up, to, his, classic, Re-Animator., The, latest, batch, of, CDs, announced, by, Quartet, includes, an, expanded, version, of, the, only, full, score, Stephen, Sondheim, composed, for, the, screen,, the, 1974, French, biopic, STAVISKY,, directed, by, Alain, Resnais, and, starring, Jean-Paul, Belmondo, as, the, swindler, Alexandre, Stavisky,, adding, 20, minutes, of, Sondheim, score, to, the, previous, LP/CD, releases., (Along, with, a, handful, of, original, film, songs,, Sondheim, wrote, the, love, theme, for, Warren, Beatty's, Reds.), La-La, Land, has,

PM, There, were, a, handful, of, gang-related, pictures, made, in, the, late, ‘70s,, from, Walter, Hill’s, “The, Warriors”, to, George, Romero’s, “Knightriders,”, but, the, film, that’s, proven, to, be, the, most, durable, –, even, though, it, received, the, least, exposure, at, the, time, –, was, Philip, Kaufman’s, superb,, atmospheric THE, WANDERERS, (****,, 117/123, mins.,, R). This, 1979, effort, from, director, Kaufman, (“The, Right, Stuff”), isn’t, just, head, and, shoulders, above, its, similarly-themed, cinematic, counterparts,, but, multiple, viewings, confirm, it’s, one, of, the, finest, films, of, its, decade, altogether., Comments:,   (read, on), Film, Score, Friday, 3/31/17, Posted, By, Scott, Bettencourt, 3/30/2017, -, 9:00, PM, Intrada, plans, to, release, one, new, CD, next, week., Kritzerland's, latest, release, is, the, first-ever, CD, of, the, score, for, the, 1967, science-fiction, comedy, ROCKET, TO, THE, MOON, (aka, Those, Fantastic, Flying, Fools),, starring, Burl, Ives, and, Terry-Thomas, and, loosely, inspired, by, the, books, of, Jules, Verne., The, score, was, composed, by, John, Scott, (back, when, he, was, billed, as, Patrick, John, Scott),, and, was, originally, released, in, England, on, an, LP, so, rare, that, even, I,, who, have, been, collecting, soundtracks, for, more, than, 40, years,, didn't, even, know, of, its, existence, until, a, few, weeks, ago., This, weekend, I, was, listening, to, the, soundtrack, LP, for, writer-director, S., Craig, Zahler's, terrific, horror, Western, BONE, TOMAHAWK,, with, its, score, composed, by, Jeff, Herriott, and, Zahler, himself., It's, been, nearly, a, year, and, a, half, since, I, saw, the, film,, and, it's, low-key,, somber, music, wasn't, especially, fresh, in, my, memory,, so, it, wasn't, until, the, end, title, song, played, that, I, realized, I, was, playing, the, album, at, the, wrong, speed, --, because, nowhere, on, the, album, label,, the, cover,, the, inserts,, or, even, the, sticker, on, the, plastic, wrap,, did, it, mention, that, the, album, was, meant, to, be, played, at, 45, rpm, (nor, is, it, mentioned, on, the, label's, website,, or, on, the, album's, Amazon, listing)., That's, the, kind, of, information, that's, handy, to, know, when, you, put, an, album, on, the, turntable., Comments:,   (read, on), Aisle, Seat, 3-28:, Spring, Arrival, Edition, Posted,

Classics, line, this, month,, including, the, memorable, Tatum, O’Neal/Irene, Cara, team-up CERTAIN, FURY, (87, mins.,, 1985,, R) and, Sybil, Danning’s, oddball, exploitation, pic THEY’RE, PLAYING, WITH, FIRE, (96, mins.,, 1984,, R). I, remember, seeing, “Certain, Fury”, listed, on, a, handful, of, “Worst, of, 1985″, lists,, but, was, too, young, to, actually, sit, through, it., Decades, later,, all, of, us, have, that, opportunity, thanks, to, Kino, Lorber’s, Blu-Ray, and, this, insane, exploitation, picture, –, directed, by, Stephen, Gyllenhaal, (dad, to, Jake, and, Maggie), –, does, not, disappoint., Comments:,   (read, on), Film, Score, Friday, 3/24/17, Posted, By, Scott, Bettencourt, 3/23/2017, -, 9:00, PM, The, latest, CD, from, Intrada, pairs, two, previously, unreleased, scores,

(Original, Song, Score),, along, with, lyricists, Bill, Melendez, and, Al, Shean., Multiple, LPs, of, the, film's, music, were, released, at, the, time,, including, one, that, also, featured, other, McKuen, themes, and, which, was, recently, released, on, CD, by, Varese, Sarabande., This, Kritzerland, release, is, the, first-ever, release, of, the, complete, score, and, songs, recorded, for, the,

pop-culture, icon, like, King, Kong,, it’s, surprising, that, the, Big, Ape, hasn’t, had, a, whole, lot, of, cinematic, success., Sure,, the, 1933, RKO, original, is, an, all-time, masterwork,, but, you, can’t, say, the, same, about, its, hastily, produced, sequel, “Son, of, Kong,”, its, decent, –, if, not, somewhat, overlooked, –, 1976, Dino, DeLaurentiis, remake,, or, that, version’s, own,, terrible, follow-up, “King, Kong, Lives.”, A, pair, of, ‘60s, Toho, productions, brought, Kong, to, Japan, –, including, a, silly, skirmish, with, Godzilla, –, and, the, best, you, can, say, about, them, is, that, they’re, at, least, more, fun, than, Peter, Jackson’s, self-indulgent, 2005, remake, of, the, original,, which, was, both, miscast, and, painfully, overlong., Comments:,   (read, on), Film, Score, Friday, 3/17/17, Posted, By, Scott, Bettencourt, 3/16/2017, -, 9:00, PM, Intrada, plans, to, release, one, new, CD, next, week., Varese, Sarabande, has, announced, the, latest, releases, in, their, limited, edition, CD, Club, series,, which, can, be, ordered, now, and, should, already, be, shipping., The, romantic, drama, STANLEY, &, IRIS,, starring, Jane, Fonda, and, Robert, De, Niro,, was, the, final, film, directed, by, the, great, Martin, Ritt, (Hud,, The, Spy, Who, Came, in, from, the, Cold,, Sounder),, and, featured, one, of, John, Williams's, most, underrated, scores., Varese, originally, released, a, CD, with, 29, minutes, of, Williams', lovely, score, at, the, time, of, the, film's, 1990, release,, but, their, new, Deluxe, Edition, not, only, adds, additional, cues, but, also, includes, the, first-ever, release, of, Williams', 20-minute, score, for, Ritt's, 1972, romantic, comedy-drama, PETE, 'N', TILLIE,, which, starred, Walter, Matthau, and, Carol, Burnett, and, earned, Oscar, nominations, for, Julius, J., Epstein's, screenplay, and, Geraldine, Page's, supporting, performance., (When, I, was, 11, years, old,, this, was, my, favorite, movie, --, I, don't, know, if, it, was, because, it, was, partly, shot, in, my, home, town,, or, because, I, subconsciously, identified, with, Burnett's, character,, somehow, realizing, I, would, grow, up, to, become, a, wisecracking, redheaded, spinster)., In, the, 1990s,, it, seemed, like, half, the, action, films, being, produced, could, be, described, as, "Die, Hard, on, a...",, and, after, Steven, Seagal, had, his, biggest, hit, with, the, "Die, Hard, on, a, battleship", Under, Siege, (which, earned, two, Oscar, nominations, and, led, to, director, Andrew, Davis, and, co-star, Tommy, Lee, Jones, reteaming, for, The, Fugitive, the, following, year),, it, was, only, to, be, expected, that, "the, cook, from, Under, Siege", (as, the, sequel's, trailer, described, Seagal's, character), should, return, for, the, "Die, Hard, on, a, train", sequel, UNDER, SIEGE, 2:, DARK, TERRITORY., Geoff, Murphy, (Utu,, Young, Guns, II), was, the, director, this, time,, and, the, supporting, cast, included, acclaimed, stage, monologuist, Eric, Bogosian, as, the, villain, and, a, 16-year-old, Katherine, Heigl, as, Seagal's, daughter., The, rousing, score, was, composed, by, the, great, Basil, Poledouris,, and, while, Varese's, previous, Under, Siege, 2, release, was, from, the, era, when, score, CDs, were, habitually, only, 30, minutes, long, for, financial, reasons,, their, Deluxe, Edition, expands, Poledouris', score, to, a, whopping, 75, minutes., Their, third, CD, Club, release, is, an, Encore, Edition, re-release, of, their, out-of-print, CD, of, THE, BLACK, CAULDRON,, the, Disney-produced, animated, fantasy, with, a, symphonic, score, by, Elmer, Bernstein,, for, which, he, re-recorded, 32, minutes, of, his, score, for, the, Varese, LP/CD, (the, original, Bernstein, score, tracks, were, released, decades, later, by, Intrada)., Comments:,   (read, on), Aisle, Seat, 3-14:, Shout's, Pre-Spring, Blu-Ray, Fling, Posted, By, Andy, Dursin, 3/13/2017, -, 9:00, PM, In, the, annals, of, misguided,, terrible, sequels, ROBOCOP, 2, (*½,, 117, mins.,, 1990,, R) stands, out, in, a, crowded, pack., Hastily, produced, to, lessen, the, financial, burdens, of, fading, Orion, Pictures,, haphazardly, constructed, with, a, script, that, was, overhauled, daily, by, a, comic, book, scribe, who, had, never, written, a, film, before,, and, directed, by, a, Hollywood, veteran, who, apparently, recognized, its, problems, (but, wasn’t, the, film’s, first, choice),, “Robocop, 2″, made, modest, cash, in, the, Summer, of, 1990, but, still, failed, completely, to, fulfill, its, two, goals, –, keeping, Orion, afloat, and, maintaining, Robocop, as, a, viable, box-office, presence, of, his, own., Comments:,   (read, on), NEXT, 10, >>, Film, Score, Monthly, Online, •, King, of,
