Records, Reviewer:, Irfan, Shah, At, once, mainstream,, jazz, and, outsider, art,, he, continues, to, plough, a, happy, furrow, through, the, music, scene, and, has, added, to, one, of, the, loveliest, and, most, underrated, back, catalogues, in, music, with, his, latest, release., �For, the, Ghosts, Within�, is, a, collaboration, between, Wyatt,, saxophonist, Gilad, Atzman, and, violinst, Ros, Stephen, which, puts, original, compositions, alongside, standards, such, as, �Round, Midnight�, and, �In, a, Sentimental, Mood�., So, much, hangs, on, his, voice, �, personally, I, think, it�s, a, lovely, thing,, that, soft, south, England, accent, wandering, through, string, quartets, and, aching, sax,, hanging, notes, and, a, vague, sense, that, Wyatt, is, wandering, around, his, house, in, nightgown, and, slippers, singing, to, himself, and, unaware, that, he, has, an, audience, entranced, by, his, performance., And, it, is, an, uneven, album,, in, the, best, sense, �, the, title, track, is, a, sumptuous,, twisting, ballad, with, guest, vocalist, Tali, Atzman�s, haunting, voice, floating, amidst, eastern, scales,, an, embroidery, of, sound, that, carries, lightly, the, darker, thematic, resonances, and, is, followed, by, �Where, Are, They, Now?�, which, sounds, like, a, trad, jazz, take, on, Mozart�s, Divertimenti, ,, plunging, in, and, out, of, sampled, beats, and, Arabic, rap., This, is, what, self-indulgence, should, sound, like., And, a, thought, strikes, me, �, that, maybe,, to, act, with, total, self-indulgence, is, to, behave, with, complete, integrity., But, I, digress, �, �For, the, Ghosts, Within�, is, your, favourite, batty, uncle,, your, letter, to, Santa, delivered,, a, guiltless-guilty, pleasure, and, a, tender, and, understated, treat., �l�f, Arnalds, -, Innundir, skinni, Music, Label:, One, Little, Indian, Reviewer:, A., Sargeant, Gonks., You, remember, them, don�t, you?, Small,, furry, soft, toys, your, sister, used, to, collect., Like, me,, you, probably, never, really, got, them,, but, at, one, time, they, were, a, �must, have�, playground, accessory., But, unlike, Rubiks, Cubes,, they, couldn�t, be, used, as, a, tool, to, dazzle, your, mates, with, how, brainy, you, were, and, unlike, conkers,, they, proved, inadequate, when, trying, to, deal, someone, a, really, cruel, blow, on, a, wet-play, in, January., In, fact, it, was, impossible, to, say, with, any, certainty, if, these, unaccountably, ghoulish, freaks, with, their, simple, expressions, and, big, hair, served, any, credible, purpose, at, all,, outside, of, making, kids, nervous., And, it�s, a, similar, proposition, with, much, of, the, music, coming, out, of, Iceland., As, otherworldly, as, a, six-mile, traffic, diversion, in, Mid, Wales,, as, tricksy, as, a, hobbit, and, as, likely, to, confound, as, Stephen, Hawking�s, diaries,, artists, like, Bjork,, Mum, and, Sigur, Ros, might, offer, tunes, to, rival, aurora, borealis, in, terms, of, beauty,, but, rarely, do, we, understand, them., And, it�s, a, stereotype, that, �l�f, Arnalds, seems, unlikely, to, disrupt,, not, least, because, all, these, artists, either, appear, on, or, are, in, some, way, connected, to, the, album, in, one, way, or, another, -, Bjork, appearing, on, the, creepily, exquisite, torch, song,, �Surrender�, and, Sigur, Ros, keys-chap,, Kjartan, Sveinsson, have, produced, the, album., Sparse,, minimal, and, as, tremulous, as, a, voice, creeping, down, the, quietest, of, library, aisles,, tunes, like, �Jonathon�, and, �Svif, Birki�, bring, to, mind, the, weeping,, ethereal, beauty, of, more, accessible, folk, triumphs, like, James, Yorkston,, whilst, the, rousing, vocal, revelry, of, �Vinur, Minn�, packs, more, energy, and, more, sudden, movements, than, Zorba, the, Greek., Arnalds, may, seem, two, strings, short, of, a, full, charango, on, occasions, (�Crazy, Car�, is, frankly, baffling), but, its, no, less, charming, because, of, it., And, whilst, the, lute, might, not, be, the, traditional, weapon, of, choice, it, works, in, the, rather, alien,, and, tirelessly, kooky, context, of, �Innundir, skinni�.,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , reviews,
