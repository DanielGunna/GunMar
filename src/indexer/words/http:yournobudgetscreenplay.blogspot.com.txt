[Your, No, Budget, Screenplay, This, Blog, has, been, designed, to, make, you, a, better, screen, writer., As, a, ultra, low, budget, filmmaker, I, need, good, scripts, and, instead, of, going, over, and, over, what, I, expect, in, a, good, script, I, decided, to, post, this, blog, to, teach, how, to, write, a, good, low, budget, script., This, will, teach, you, many, of, the, things, that, you, need, to, keep, in, mind, when, writing, a, low, or, no, budget, screenplay., Saturday,, February, 27,, 2016, The, New, World, Of, Screenwriting, The, New, World, Of, Screenwriting, The, Dslr, revolution, amongst, low, and, micro, budget, film, makers, has, changed, the, way, that, screenwriters, are, looked, at, by, film, makers. ,  ,   , There, are, now, two, worlds., The, Hollywood, way, of, looking, at, screenwriters., The, screenwriter, is, a, tool, that, is, to, be, used,, abused, and, when, it, begins, to, make, noise, to, be, replaced, with, a, younger, and, cheaper, version., Hollywood, believes, in, the, need, for, quality, screenplays,, but, not, necessarily, the, need, for, writers., You, can, still, get, rich, there,, but, you, stand, a, better, chance, of, hitting, it, big, with, a, novel, as, you, do, with, a, dozen, quality, screenplays.,  The, indie, world, of, film, making, offers, the, screenwriter, far, less, money, up, front., Face, it, most, of, us, will, be, working, of, spec,, but, the, script, will, get, made, and, the, power, of, the, screenwriter, in, the, micro, budget, world, is, like, that, of, the, writer, in, the, world, of, network, television., You, matter, more, and, if, you, want, to, be, the, film, maker, then, all, that, is, required, is, a, great, deal, of, hard, work,, a, few, dollars,, a, strong, computer, to, edit, on, and, a, dlsr, camera., Christopher, Nolan, wrote, and, directed, his, first, film, Following, for, a, few, thousand, dollars, with, a, bunch, of, friends., The, film, was, shot, over, the, span, of, a, year, of, weekends.,  ,  ,  ,  , Look, at, it, this, way., In, the, Hollywood, system, you, as, the, screenwriter, is, looked, upon, as, a, house, elf, who, may, serve, long, enough, to, earn, your, clothes., In, the, micro, budget, universe, you, at, worst, a, high, ranking, resistance, fighter, and, at, best, a, long, lost, Jedi, Knight.Your, skills, are, viewed, as, important, as, those, of, the, leading, actor,, the, director, or, producer.,  , The, thing, that, I, wish, to, leaved, you, with, today, is, a, single, piece, of, advice, moving, forward., Decide, on, what, kind, of, screenwriter, that, you, wish, to, be., A, Hollywood, writer, or, an, indie, writer. ,  Can’t, I, do, both? , Yes, and, no, is, my, answer. , A, low, budget, writer, who, pens, a, film, like, Mad, Max, can, write, films, like, Thunderdome, and, Fury, Road., A, guy, who, writes, the, Evil, Dead, can, do, three, Spiderman, films, scripts., While, someone, who, did, Star, Wars, films, for, twenty, years, cannot, think, in, terms, of, less, than, thirty, million, dollars, or, once, you, have, done, big, budget, horror, films, such, as, the, Village, and, the, Happening, you, think, that, spending, five, million, dollars, to, shoot, The, Visit, (most, indies, could, have, done, it, shot, for, shot, for, less, than, a, hundred, thousand), cannot, got, micro, budget. , Decide, which, type, of, writer, you, are,, not, want, to, be,, but, are, and, you, will, be, on, your, way. , Thank, you, for, visiting, today, and, my, final, piece, of, advice, is, to, study, film, making, this, cannot, help, but, to, make, you, a, best, writer, of, film.,  , Posted, by, rodney, cannon, at, 5:00, PM, No, comments:, Email, ThisBlogThis!Share, to, TwitterShare, to, FacebookShare, to, Pinterest,

About, Public, Domain, Comic, Books,  As, we, watch, another, summer, where, many, of, the, massive, budget, films, were, adapted, from, popular, comic, books., as, a, micro, budget, screenwriter, there, are, not, many, direct, ways, for, you, to, get, in, on, the, action., These, adaptations, are, for, those, who, have, worked, in, the, Hollywood, system, for, a, while., There, are, however, ways, for, you, to, prove, yourself, capable, of, writing, one, of, these, types, of, screenplays., I, have, superheroe, dreams, like, many, of, your., I, would, love, to, do, a, Green, Hornet, screenplay,, but, no, one, is, going, to, offer, me, a, shot, unless, I, have, a, track, record. ,  How, do, you, build, a, track, record, in, this, genre? ,  You, can, write, a, great, fan, film, based, upon, one, of, your, favorite, heroes., The, best, micro, budget, superhero, film, that, I, have, ever, seen, (better, than, a, few, of, the, big, budget, versions, as, well), is, a, fan, film, titled, Joker, Rising., That, movie’s, script, is, a, great, calling, card., You, could, do, the, same, thing., The, only, problem, with, this, is, that, you, either, need, to, be, a, film, maker, or, network, with, film, makers, who, are, interested, in, shooting, a, fan, film.,     ,  Recently, I, was, introduced, to, a, new, concept., Instead, of, adapting, a, famous, comic, book, into, a, screenplay, why, not, adapt, a, public, domain, comic, book., A, little, known, fact, is, that, there, are, thousands, of, comics, that, have, fallen, into, the, public, domain, due, to, the, fact, that, the, companies, in, the, forties, and, fifties, that, released, them, went, out, of, businesses, and, never, renewed, the, copyrights. ,  “That, was, a, long, time, ago., You, can, not, be, serious., Who, wants, to, bring, back, a, character, from, the, forties, or, fifties?”You, say. ,  , Superman,, Batman,, Wonderwoman, and, my, favorite, Captain, America, began, their, careers, around, World, War, 2., Those, characters, have, endured, and, changed, with, the, times., You, should, take, the, time, to, investigate, these, lost, characters., There, are, also, characters, that, are, based, upon, mythical, heroes, such, as, Thor, or, Isis., You, can, take, these, heroes, and, created, a, screenplay, featuring, them, as, long, as, they, do, not, resemble, their, comic, book, counterparts., Sci-fi, channel, does, things, like, this, all, the, time., They, did, a, Thor, movie, and, it, was, pretty, bad,, but, they, did, it, and, had, no, problem, with, the, copyright. , You, can, make, the, Frankenstein, monster, into, a, hero, an, antihero, like, Dracula, which, is, done, to, perfection, in, the, anime, series, Hellsing.,  ,  , If, you, chose, to, do, this, you, must, first, find, a, subject, that, you, love., Read, the, original, material, over, and, over, until, you, know, every, single, detail, and, then, get, to, work, on, the, story., If, you, do, not, love, a, character, and, comic, book, based, films, are, usually, character, driven, stories, then, you, should, not, attempt, the, task, of, writing, a, screenplay, based, upon, that, character. ,  Good, luck, with, your, project, and, please, take, a, moment, to, add, me, to, your, google, plus., I, may, have, some, news, soon, about, a, screenplay, I, have, been, working, on, for, sometime.,

constantly, talk, about, the, audience., He, always, had, what, each, and, ever, scene, was, doing, to, his, audience., Film, making, to, him, was, the, art, of, conducting, an, audience, like, a, conduct, would, conduct, an, orchestra. ,  When, sitting, down, to, craft, your, screenplay, are, you, only, considering, the, characters, on, the, page, or, are, you, thinking, about, the, audience, that, someday, will, be, getting, to, know, them., When, you, have, mastered, your, craft, you, will, find, yourself, considering, what, each, scene, and, within, those, scenes, what, each, line, of, dialogue, and, or, action, is, going, to, be, doing, to, this, audience.,   , The, first, and, best, way, to, get, the, audience, involved, with, your, screenplay, is, to, get, them, to, care, about, you, characters., These, characters, do, not, have, to, be, likeable,, but, they, do, need, to, be, understandable, and, relatable., If, they, care, about, your, lead, character, or, villain, then, you, are, half, way, home.,  ,  , Thank, you, very, much, for, visiting, my, blog., If, you, are, interested, in, learning, all, the, basics, of, writing, a, micro, budget, screenplay, then, I, would,

available, by, the, middle, of, the, month, of, November., Until, then, I, thought, that, I, would, touch, base, with, all, of, my, blogs., I, have, had, little, to, say, about, screenwriting, due, to, the, fact, that, I, published, a, really, good, book, on, the, subject, last, year, and, the, fact, that, it, comes, easy, to, me, these, days. , Part, of, writing, about, any, given, subject, is, the, effort, to, find, a, better, way, to, understand, that, subject., I, write, about, film, making, at, my, other, blog, because, there, is, a, lifetime, of, lessons, left, to, learn, on, that, subject., Returning, to, this, blog, I, can, predict, that, I, will, approach, future, post, more, from, the, angle, of, a, film, maker, rather, than, a, screen, writer. , As, a, writer, first,, I, thought, only, in, terms, of, story., Now, I, look, at, the, screenplay, in, a, new, light., I, will, explain, what, I, mean, by, this, in, future, post., Right, now, I, would, like, to, share, a, backlog, of, videos, from, a, few, accomplished, screen, writers.,  First, up, is, Joe, Eszterhas. ,  , Next, up, is, Peter, Russell.,  The, last, writer, we, are, going, to, hear, from, is, Thunder, Levin., If, you, do, not, know, him, he, wrote, a, certain, shark/tornado, movie., Okay,, fine,, I, will, say, it., He, wrote, Sharknado, and, he, seems, to, be, proud, of, it. ,  ,  Thank, you, for,

The, Footage, Script,    ,    ,    ,    ,    , The, Found, Footage, Vs., The, Footage, Script,    , The, found, footage, film, is, here, to, stay, as, long, as, it, grows, and, adapts., Adaptation, is, the, key, to, this., The, western,, the, gangster, film, and, the, horror, film, changed, over, time., The, horror, film, of, the, silent, era, grew, up, to, become, the, four, star, films, produced, by, Universal, films, in, the, 1930's., The, genre, nearly, died, off, and, then, came, back, with, a, vengeance, in, the, 50's., Led, by, Hammer, horror, films, and, aided, with, a, massive, wave, of, the, newly, introduced, scifi, horror, film.,    , We, all, know, the, formula, by, now., A, group, of, people,, one, armed, with, a, recording, device,, find, themselves, in, a, life, and, death, situation., This, situation, is, usually, supernatural, or, thriller, related., Despite, the, best, efforts, of, the, mostly, brain, dead, or, functioning, brain, damaged, lead, characters, they, end, up, getting, themselves, killed, while, the, camera, is, still, recording., That, death, is, symbolic, for, the, death, of, the, genre.,    , Found, footage,, must, become, footage, films., This, is, done, at, the, screenplay, level, and, that, is, the, reason, for, this, post.,    , What, I, have, found, is, that, most, found, footage, films, are, not, written, they, are, outlined., They, are, usually, structured, in, the, form, of, a, treatment., The, basic, scenes, are, written, in, normal, screenplay, style., The, interiors, or, exteriors, are, noted, and, then, there, is, a, description, of, what, the, characters, are, suppose, to, do, and, talk, about, in, the, scene, without, actually, stage, direction, or, dialogue, being, written., As, a, writer, you, are, leaving, to, much, to, chance, in, the, found, footage, genre.,    , The, footage, film, screenplay, is, the, wave, of, the, future.,    , What, is, a, Footage, screenplay, and, have, I, ever, seen, an, example.,    , The, footage, screenplay, is, a, screenplay, that, incorporates, footage, shot, by, someone, or, a, series, of, people, and, or, security, cameras, on, screen, and, mixes, it, with, footage, from, a, third, person, shooter, (the, cameraman). , The, best, example, of, this, kind, of, film, making, is, the, movie, End, of, Watch., Where, the, editing, is, done, so, well, that, you, have, to, really, focus, on, each, scene, to, notice, when, and, where, the, switches, are, made.,  ,    , Below, is, a, great, example, of, how, footage, and, found, footage, can, be, combined, to, produce, a, quality, low, budget, film. , Screen, was, shot, on, a, budget, of, about, four, thousand, dollars, and, combines, footage, from, iphones, and, the, Canon, 5d, mark, II.,    , This, style, of, screen, writing, gives, control, back, to, the, writer, to, deliver, a, quality, story., If, you, are, going, to, put, your, name, on, a, found, footage, screenplay, even, if, you, only, wrote, a, twenty, page, outline, you, are, going, to, be, blamed, if, it, stinks., For, the, sake, of, your, writing, career, the, Footage, screenplay, gives, you, more, control, over, the, content, that, will, comprise, the, finished, product.,    , You, will, have, to, pick, your, devices, and, where, and, when, to, embed, the, on, screen, devices., Writing, one, of, these, films, will, require, you, to, think, at, times, as, a, director, within, the, film, itself., When, inserting, them, into, the, script, put, these, scenes, down, as, point, of, view, (POV)., Character’s, name, and, then, POV., POV, of, security, cam, or, webcam.,    , You, will, find, the, best, way, of, doing, this., Just, think, in, terms, of, footage, rather, than, found, footage, and, this, will, be, a, gift, both, to, characters, and, audience., The, audience, that, views, the, finished, product, will, thank, you., The, characters, that, survive, rather, than, finding, themselves, laying, dead, in, a, pool, of, their, own, blood, beside, a, sputtering, camcorder, will, love, you.,    , Now, go, write, some, great, scenes, so, that, you, or, your, director, can, go, out, and, shoot, some, great, footage., That, will, be, it, for, today., Please, take, a, moment, to, add, me, to, your, Google, plus, and, to, share, this, post, on, your, facebook., Posted, by, rodney, cannon, at,

with, holiday, themes., This, is, nothing, new., Holiday, movies, have, been, part, of, the, film, making, landscape, since, the, very, early, days., Simple, stories, about, home, and, faith, and, family., I, say, home, and, faith, and, family, while, leaving, out, Santa, Claus, because, after, watching, two, weeks, non, stop, of, these, kinds, of, films, I, am, going, to, suggest, that, we, all, take, a, step, away, from, the, I, am, Santa, films., I, understand, why, many, filmmakers, pick, the, Santa, film,, it, is, a, way, of, making, a, movie, all, inclusive, and, a, way, of, avoiding, questions, of, faith., I, would, ask, those, film, makers, the, question, “Is, that, what, you, really, want, to, be?”, The, equivalent, of, oatmeal, or, canned, tuna?, The, holiday, film, that, embraces, faith, and, family, most, of, all, is, the, most, popular, of, them, all,, It’s, A, Wonderful, Life., The, second, most, popular, are, versions, of, A, Christmas, Carol., Even, the, story, of, Santa, Claus, is, based, upon, the, life, of, a, Christian, Saint., To, do, something, truly, memorable, and, lasting, you, may, need, to, embrace, this, part, of, the, holiday, theme., Switch, for, a, moment, to, the, area, of, comedy, I, am, not, against, in, anyway, films, such, as, -, Plains,, Trains, and, Automobiles, or, the, first, two, Home, Alone, films., Comedy, has, its, place., Although, those, movies, are, not, low, budget., You, should, always, try, to, find, a, place, to, include, a, little, comedy, in, your, film, even, if, is, a, serious, drama., A, holiday, film, script, that, is, too, down, beat, can, be, a, hard, sell., I, wish, that, good, old, fashion, tear, jerkers, were, still, popular,, but, audience, are, not, demanding, them., A, lead, character, with, a, strong, sense, of, humor, is, a, good, thing., They, may, not, tell, the, jokes,, but, they, should, be, able, to, get, the, joke, or, have, the, ability, to, laugh, at, themselves. ,    ,  The, great, thing, about, holiday, films, is, that, most, of, them, are, at, their, core, very, simple, scripts, to, write., The, plots, usually, come, down, to, two, subjects., Either, going, home, or, appreciating, what, you, had, at, home., A, nice, twist, on, this, theme, is, the, Nicholas, Cage, film,, The, Family, Man., The, going, home, plot, can, fit, perfectly, into, the, no, budget, screenplay, world., You, can, set, one, of, these, stories, inside, of, a, car, or, on, a, bus., Keeping, your, characters, on, the, move, can, keep, your, story, fresh, as, you, introduce, new, characters, and, situations, every, few, pages., A, few, words, on, watching, your, budget, in, the, travel, and, home, types, of, scripts., Do, not, constantly, change, mode, of, transportation., This, works, great, in, a, large, budget, film, like, Planes,, Trains, and, Automobiles,, but, will, kill, a, micro, budget, film., If, your, character, or, characters, are, travelling, by, car, you, can, change, vehicles, a, few, times, without, blowing, up, a, budget., If, it, is, by, bus, the, same, bus, location, can, double, for, multiple, buses, locations., After, all, if, you, have, seen, the, inside, of, one, cross, country, bus, then, you, have, seen, them, all., Plane, and, train, travel, can, be, done, on, a, low, budget, depending, on, area, of, the, country, and, access, to, sets., If, you, or, the, person, that, will, be, shooting, your, script, lives, in, LA., NY., or, a, Canadian, film, making, center, then, this, can, be, done, without, blowing, up, a, budget., Now, a, note, on, the, faith, based, holiday, film., You, can, write, for, a, larger, cast, and, crew, than, a, standard, low, budget, film, because, the, film, maker, will,, if, he, or, she, is, smart,, partner, with, a, church, or, community, organization, that, will, open, the, doors, to, many, free, locations, such, as, churches, and, community, centers, along, with, many, people, who, will, be, willing, to, offer, their, services, for, free., Just, remember, the, trade, off, in, this, area, is, that, you, must, present, a, G, or, PG, rated, story, with, no, subject, material, that, will, be, objected, to., This, will, include, Santa, and, elves,, do, not, include, them., In, the, faith, based, world, Christmas, is, a, high, holy, day., Christmas, is, the, beginning, of, the, love, story, between, mankind, and, god., Although, there, are, a, few, dozen, new, family, and, faith, based, films, coming, to, television, this, year, there, is, only, one, that, will, playing, in, theaters., The, Christmas, Candle,, and, it, like, almost, every, such, film, has, been, beaten, up, by, critics., If, you, want, to, be, loved, by, critics, and, to, win, awards, you, are, not, going, to, get, them, if, you, write, in, this, niche., Critics, did, not, care, much, for, It’s, A, Wonderful, Life, so, understand, that, you, will, have, little, to, no, hope, of, winning, them, over.,  ,   , I, may, have, suggested, rules,, but, the, truth, is, that, there, are, no, rules., You, can, tell, your, holiday, story, anyway, that, you, wish, if, you, are, going, to, be, the, film, maker., If, you, want, to, take, your, screenplay, to, market, then, you, will, have, to, consider, some, of, the, basic, rules., Directors, and, producers, seem, to, want, the, familiar., This, is, perhaps, why, there, has, been, hundreds, of, variations, of, the, Christmas, Carol, plot., Last, note, on, the, subject,, you, can, mine, classic, songs, for, material., By, classic, I, mean, those, in, public, domain., If, you, want, to, use, a, modern, song, then, go, out, and, negotiate, for, permission, to, do, so., One, of, the, most, popular, Christmas, films, in, recent, years, was, the, movie, Christmas, Shoes., I, believe, that, most, movies, based, upon, songs, are, thinly, plotted,, but, it, can, get, you, from, start, to, finish, and, just, finishing, a, script, gets, you, ninety, percent, of, the, way, to, seeing, it, produced, someday., Now, if, you, feel, that, I, have, left, out, the, subject, of, horror, and, holiday, films., I, did, this, because, I, have, seen, all, of, the, Silent, Night, Deadly, Night, films., A, few, about, killer, snow, men, and, the, legendarily, bad, Santa, Slays., I, do, not, want, to, aid, you, in, writing, a, horror, movie, for, the, holidays., Peace, on, earth, and, good, will, towards, men., Please, take, a, moment, to, share, this, post,, by, Pinning, it, or, stumbling, it, or, posting, in, on, your,

was, not, getting, the, types, of, screenplays, that, she, could, relate, to., That, the, characters, did, not, look, like, her., At, first, this, struck, me, as, sounding, unusual,, after, all, characters, are, characters., They, are, just, names, on, a, piece, of, paper., Well, as, we, talk, about, it, I, began, to, see, what, she, was, saying., The, film, maker, in, question, is, Asian, and, most, of, the, screenplays, that, she, had, been, sent, introduced, each, character, with, a, short, description, of, the, characters., Are, you, seeing, where, this, is, headed?, Beyond, the, name, and, age, of, the, character, there, was, usually, a, lot, of, extras., What, this, taught, me, a, very, important, lesson, that, I, wish, to, share, with, you., Film, makers, will, come, in, all, different, shapes,, sizes,, ages, and, races., If, your, primary, goal, is, to, craft, a, screenplay, that, you, can, market, then, you, need, to, consider, this, when, you, are, doing, your, final, edit., The, best, seller, item, on, earth, is, generic., The, generic, brand, is, a, great, brand., I, am, not, suggesting, that, you, make, a, generic, screenplay,, but, characters, that, can, be, preformed, by, as, many, actors, as, possible., Keep, in, mind, that, thanks, to, digital, film, making, more, and, more, actors, are, looking, for, material, to, produce, for, themselves., Let’s, look, at, it, in, Charles, Angels, terms, for, a, second., You, write, a, screenplay., You, have, Drew, Barrymore, in, mind., She, reads, it,, does, not, care, for, it,, but, Lucy, Liu, picks, it, up., She, likes, the, script,, but, the, lead, character, is, clearly, written, for, Drew,, right, down, to, her, goofy, smile., Lucy, says, no, because, of, this., Lucy, is, a, type, and, Drew, is, a, different, type., Both, can, give, you, a, quality, performance., More, importantly, both, have, the, kind, of, resources, to, pay, you, well, for, your, screenplay.,  ,   ,  In, the, low, budget, world, of, screen, writing, you, are, going, to, be, introduced, to, film, makers, from, all, over, the, world, and, of, all, races, and, creeds., Keep, the, character, description, simple, and, generic, unless, it, is, important, to, the, story., Also, when, you, take, a, chance, it, would, be, cool, to, take, a, risk, or, two, with, characters., A, woman, could, be, your, villain, instead, of, the, cookie, cutter, guy., Who, would, have, thought, a, few, years, ago, that, the, most, well, known, drug, trafficked, in, television, history, would, look, like, the, guy, on, Breaking, Bad., Make, your, screenplay, more, marketable, by, giving, directors, and, producers, more, freedom, to, pick, a, cast., One, of, my, favorite, thrillers, is, the, movie, Taken., I, have, written, about, it, often, here., The, cast, is, solid,, but, the, script, and, the, direction, are, the, things, that, elevate, it, to, another, level., This, year, I, was, introduced, to, an, asian, film, that, I, was, told, was, as, good., The, movie, is, the, Man, From, Nowhere, and, I, believe, that, it, is, actually, a, better, film, than, Taken, because, the, script, does, not, allow, us, to, look, away, for, even, a, moment, from, the, hard, choices, that, the, characters, must, make., You, could, find, the, movie, on, Netflix, and, I, strongly, suggest, you, watch, it, and, tell, me, what, you, think., By, the, way,, the, trailer, does, not, do, it, justice., The, film, and, the, script, behind, it, works, on, so, many, levels.,   ,  Thank, you, for, visiting, my, blog., Please, take, a, moment, to, share, this, post, and, to, add, me, to, your, google, plus. , Posted, by, rodney, cannon, at, 10:45, AM, No, comments:, Email, ThisBlogThis!Share, to, TwitterShare, to, FacebookShare, to,
