Are, there, any, additional, guidelines, for, Greenbusters?, How, do, I, become, a, Greenbuster?, How, do, I, go, from, being, a, Greenbuster, to, Full, Category, Editor?, What, is, the, Greenbuster, Permission?, This, permission, gives, non-editall, editors, the, ability, to, edit, unreviewed, queues, in, very, broad, areas, of, the, directory., It, gives, editors, the, opportunity, to, expand, their, editing, abilities, by, taking, on, limited, permissions, in, very, large, categories, to, which, they, would, not, be, granted, full, editing, privileges, due, to, lack, of, experience., The, goals, of, the, Greenbuster, permission, are, to:, Reduce, to, the, backlogs, of, submissions, Scale, the, editorial, model, to, more, quickly, and, efficiently, handle, the, ever, growing, rate, of, new, submissions, Get, as, many, good, editors, editing, across, the, directory, as, possible, Give, editors, more, opportunities, to, expand, their, editing, abilities, Enhance, the, directory's, quality, and, scope, This, permission, was, inspired, by, the, Greenbusters, Project,, which, a, group, of, editors, started, to, help, reduce, submission, backlogs, and, mentor, newer, editors., See:, Test:, Team_Projects:, Past_Projects:, Greenbusters, for, more, information., What, can, a, Greenbuster, do?, Greenbusters, can, do, the, following:, Any, editing, function, in, unreviewed, Edit, sites, in, the, Greenbusted, queue, Using, the, "add, url", box,, they, can, add, new, sites, to, the, category's, greenbusted, queue, Greenbusters, do, not, have, the, ability, to, edit, reviewed, listings,, create, new, categories,, change, sort, priority,, or, any, other, feature, that, would, affect, the, reviewed, listings., How, do, I, choose, a, category, to, Greenbust?, The, idea, here, is, to, get, people, editing, at, very, high, levels, because, that's, where, the, largest, unreviewed, queues, exist., Help, Wanted, is, a, great, place, to, find, categories, to, Greenbust., If, you, apply, for, a, category, tree, that, does, not, have, unreviewed,, you, will, not, get, accepted, for, it., Generally,, apply, to, greenbust, large, categories, that, are, rather, high, in, a, directory, node., Do, not, be, put, off, by, the, number, of, reviewed, listings, because, you, will, not, be, able, to, edit, those., However,, remember, green, numbers, manage, to, freak, people, out, initially., If, you, are, a, relatively, inexperienced, editor,, avoid, asking, for, a, top, or, second, level, cat, at, the, start., Begin, lower, and, gradually, move, your, way, up., If, we, think, you, are, trying, to, bite, off, more, than, you, can, chew,, we, may, deny, your, request, and, ask, you, to, take, on, something, smaller., For, example,, if, you, edit, in, Arts:, Music:, Styles:, J:, Jazz:, Swing:, Bands_and_Artists, apply, to, Greenbuster, Arts:, Music:, Styles:, J:, Jazz., Also,, do, not, be, shy, about, requesting, to, Greenbust, a, category, that, seems, to, have, an, ample, number, of, listed, editors., Just, because, an, editor, is, listed, in, a, category, does, not, mean, s/he, devotes, all, his/her, editing, time, to, unreviewed., For, example,, Computers/Security, is, brimming, with, unreviewed, sites,, and, many, of, them, are, good,, quality, submissions., Even, though, there, are, several, editors, listed, in, this, area,, it, could, really, use, the, services, of, a, greenbusting, squad., You, can, be, a, greenbuster, in, more, than, one, category., What, happens, to, my, Greenbusted, links?, Your, greenbusted, links, will, be, reviewed, and, added, to, the, "live", listings, by, the, resident, category, editors, or, others, who, have, permission, to, edit, the, category., Unlike, the, Greenbusters, Project,, no, one, is, obligated, to, give, you, feedback, on, your, edits., If, you, want, someone, to, review, your, edits,, then, you, may, ask, a, resident, category, editor,, or, make, a, request, in, the, "category, check", thread, in, the, New, Editor's, forum., All, greenbusted, edits, are, recorded, in, your, edit, logs., At, this, time,, greenbusted, links, are, not, visible, to, the, public,, and, are, not, included, in, the, weekly, RDF, dump., Are, there, any, additional, guidelines, for, Greenbusters?, Greenbusters, follow, the, ODP, Editing, Guidelines, and, all, applicable, category, guidelines., Note:, Greenbusters, should, not, process, Updates, in, unreviewed, or, add, links, that, already, exist, in, the, category, where, they, are, Greenbusting., Currently, the, system, does, not, allow, duplicates, between, the, Reviewed, and, Greenbusted, listings., So, if, you, update, an, existing, URL,, it, will, get, moved, to, the, Greenbusted, listing,, and, thus, removed, from, the, RDF., This, is, not, good., How, do, I, become, a, Greenbuster?, Apply, using, the, New, Category, Request, form., Select, the, "Greenbuster", permission, type, option., This, form, can, also, be, accessed, from, your, Editor, Dasboard, by, following, the, link, called, "Request, to, be, editor, for, another, category.", How, do, I, go, from, being, a, Greenbuster, to, Full, Category, Editor?, Send, in, a, new, category, permissions, request., If, you, are, doing, a, good, job, at, greenbusting, the, category,, you, may, be, granted, the, category., However,, please, do, not, go, to, a, meta, to, request, an, upgrade., Use, the, new, category, permissions, form., Last, update:, Sat, Aug, 25, 10:31, EDT, 2012, Copyright, ©, 2016, AOL, Inc., (Terms, of, Use, -, License)]
