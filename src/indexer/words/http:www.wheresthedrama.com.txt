narrative, we, play, out, emotionally, and, intellectually, through, our, behaviours, and, languages., If, there, are, problems,, they, aren't, necessarily, because, we, have, erected, ourselves, as, the, central, character, in, our, story,, as, it, is, because, we, are, unwilling, to, embrace, the, possibility, that,, at, its, source,, our, story, is, an, inspired, collaboration, that, has, no, meaning, apart, from, our, relationships., To, work, as, a, medium,, channeling, characters, and, stories,, is, to, immerse, oneself, in, a, "show", that, appears, as, if, it, is, being, performed, by, some, thing, other, than, yourself., To, assent, to, this, metaphor, of, showing, is, to, acknowledge, that, there's, no, better, way, of, entering, a, story, other, than, surrendering, to, it,, and, allowing, it, to, enter, you, -, a, condition, and, quality, of, creative, openness., When, this, happens,, the, usual, demarcations, that, separate, the, dreamer, from, the, dream, are, erased., In, jettisoning, the, ego-centric, "SELF, that, creates", -, the, grand, puppeteer, -, we, surrender, our, need, to, manipulate, and, judge,, and, allow, ourselves, to, be, audience, and, witnesses, to, the, story, told, or, enacted, by, the, characters, that, are, becoming, present, in, us, and, through, us.  ,   , W, E, L, C, O, M, E,  , T, O,  , T, H, E  , D, R, A, M, A , !, The most,
