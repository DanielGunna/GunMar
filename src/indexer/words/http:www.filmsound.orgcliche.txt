distances). , All, sub, machine, guns, sound, alike, and, have, the, same, rate, of, fire, Machine, guns, and, their, rate, of, fire, ..., most, users, of, these, weapons, can, manage, to, sustain, over, 10, second, continuous, rate, of, fire, (in, actuality,, you, are, supposed, to, fire, the, things, in, short, bursts, --, after, a, long, burst, the, barrel, will, heat, up, so, much, the, weapon, will, jam)., Also, I, have, never, ever, seen, any, protagonist, change, a, MGs, *barrel*, no, matter, how, long, he, has, used, the, MG., (the, barrels, overheat,, and, also, sustain, incrediable, wear, requiring, these, to, be, changed, --, often, in, battle,, the, gunner's, mate, will, carry, spare, barrels, as, well, as, the, inexhaustible, ammo, supply, which, weighs,

make, a, distinkt, riccoche, sound, and, when, flying, past, you, they, make, a, zip, noise, when, in, fact, they, are, moving, faster, than, the, speed, of, sound, and, in, real, life, would, produce, a, whip, lash, or, bang, sound, Handguns:, All, handguns, make, a, frightening, clicking, sound, when, handled, as, though, to, suggest, that, the, parts, are, loose., The, more, advanced, the, gun, (Men, in, Black), the, louder,, and, more, varried,, the, clicking., In, real, life, any, gun, making, noises, like, that, would, probably, explode, in, your, hand, with, the, first, discharge., Note:, All, energy, type, weapons, will, power, up, with, a, loud, hum.,   , MISC , In, the, M&E-Mix, you, always, have, to, hear, footsteps, (and, cloth, rubbing), that, where, never,
