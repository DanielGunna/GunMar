Sistine, Chapel’s, Ceiling?, Big, Think, Interview, With, Robert, McKee, Robert, McKee, A, conversation, with, the, author, and, screenwriting, guru., Transcript, Over, a, year, ago, TRANSCRIPT, Question:, How, is, screenwriting, different, from, other, kinds, of, fiction, writing?,  , Robert, McKee:, Well,, the, three, great, medias,, not, only, screenplay,, but, it’s, also, the, theater,, play, writing,, and, the, prose. , I, mean,, those, are, the, three, primary. , And, they, get, mixed, a, lot. , TV, is, a, sort, of, combination, of, all, three, really,, novel,, theater,, and, film. , Graphic, novels, are, another, form, that, combines, novels, as, a, basis,, as, the, title, suggests,, with, films,, sort, of,, like, cartoons.,  , And, the, principal, differences, between, the, three, of, them, is, the, level, of, conflict, that, interests, the, writer, of, each, of, them. , And, so,, you, have, stories—they, all, tell, a, story—but, stories, involve, characters, in, conflict, with, their, social, or, physical, world,, in, personal, relationships, with, friends,, family,, lovers,, and, an, inner, conflict, within, their, own, natures, between, themselves,, their, subconscious, mind,, their, body,, their, emotions,, and, so, forth. , The, novelist, tends, to, be, interested, in, inner, conflicts;, characters, in, conflict, with, their, own, contradictory, natures,, their, own, contradictory, desires,, their, emotions. , Playwrights, tend, to, be, more, interested, in, personal, relationships,, of, family,, friends,, lovers—because, the, theater, is, a, form, for, dialogue,, primarily. , And, talk, is, the, way, in, which, people, in, personal, relationships, work, those, relationships, out, for, better, or, worse,, right? , And, so, the, power, and, the, beauty, of, the, theater, is, personal, conflicts.,  , The, power, and, beauty, in, film, is, the, extra, personal, conflicts, of, characters, in, conflict, with, their, physical, world, and, their, social, world. , And, so, all, three, media, can, tell, complex, stories, because, you, can, work, with, inner, conflict,, certainly,, in, a, film,, you, can, work, with, personal, conflict, naturally, in, a, film,, and, in, a, novel,, you, can, do, all, three,, in, a, play, you, can, do, all, three., But, the, strength, of, each, of, them, tends, to, be, at, one, of, those, three, levels. , And, so,, if, you’re, trying, to, make, a, career, choice, as, to, what, kind, of, writer, should, I, be,, you, really, need, to, ask, another, question;, which, level, of, conflict, in, life, really, interests, me, the, most? , And, then, you, would, presumably, move, into, that, medium. , But, I, know, a, lot, of, writers, whose, real, interest, is, not, at, the, level, of, conflict, that, the, medium, in, which, they, are, writing, is, strongest, in. , And, so, a, lot, of, independent, filmmakers,, for, example,, are, really, interested, in, inner, conflict. , And, so, they, should, be, writing, novels, and, not, trying, to, make, films, of, people, staring, into, space,, coming, to, big, decisions, in, their, lives,, or, whatever,, it, would, bore, people.,  , And, so,, which, level, of, conflict, interests, the, writer, is, a, critical, choice. , And, a, lot, of, writers, don’t, understand, their, own, instincts, and, they, get..., Stanislavski,, the, great, acting, teacher, once, said:, “You, have, to, figure, out, whether, you’re, in, love, with, the, art, in, yourself,, or, yourself, in, the, art.” , And, too, many, people, go, into, film,, especially,, or, television, because, they, are, in, love, with, the, idea, of, themselves, in, the, art. , They, want, to, be, in, the, movies,, they, want, to, be, in, TV,, or, even, in, the, theater,, or, whatever. , When, their, natural, talents, and, interests, lie, elsewhere. , So,, that’s, a, critical, choice, as, to, which, medium, you, choose, because, it, has, to, pair, up, with, what, really, interests, you.,  , Question:, What's, the, biggest, mistake, that, novice, screenwriters, make?,  , Robert, McKee:, The, biggest, mistake, they, will, try, to, make—that, they, will, make—is, that, they, will, try, to, adapt, to, whatever, is, trendy. , And, so, they’ll, look, at, the, hits,, they’ll, look, at, last, summer, successes,, or, even, the, independent, films,, you, know. , And, I’m, sure, that, after, a, film, like, “Boys, Don’t, Cry”, got, out,, Hollywood, was, inundated, with, interesting, little, small, stories, of, small, town, characters, in, some, kind, of, brutal, sexual, relationships,, or, whatever. , On, the, other, hand,, “Avatar”, of, course, and, films, like, that, spin, loose, imitators. , And, so, they, will, be, more, concerned, about, selling, than, they, will, about, creating,, and, the, attitude, often, of, young, writers,, or, wanna-be, writers, for, the, screen, is, that, there, is, so, much, shit, on, the, screen,, surely, my, shit, is, better, than, their, shit. , And, so,, they, want, to, get, made,, they, want, success,, they, want, to, be, in, the, movie, business,, and, so, they, will, imitate, whatever, they, see,, assuming, that, because, of, awful, stories, like, “Transformers”, get, made, that, they, just, have, to, find, another, toy, at, Toys, R’, Us, and, imitate, that, and, build, a, movie, around, it.,  , Question:, What, separates, a, good, screenwriter, from, a, bad, screenwriter?,  , Robert, McKee:, Well,, there, are, degrees, of, goodness, and, badness. , And, so,, it, could, be, a, very, subtle, difference. , And, in, that, one,, you, wouldn’t, know. , You, just, wouldn’t. , But, usually, you, can, tell, pretty, well. , Even, if, they’ve, written, 20, screenplays,, that, doesn’t, mean, that, they, have, mastered,, for, example,, the, craft, of, exposition. , I, can, pick, a, screenplay, up, or, a, novel,, whatever,, within, a, few, pages, recognize, whether, or, not, this, writer, has, a, degree, of, craft,, a, mastery, of, craft,, to, a, certain, degree, at, least,, simply, by, noting, how, they, handle, exposition. , If, they, handle, exposition, beautifully,, it, generally, means, this, is, somebody, that, is, really,, even, though, they, haven’t, been, made, or, produced,, or, whatever,, this, is, somebody, who, has, thought, deeply, about, the, craft, and, knows, how, to, draw, the, reader, into, their, story, and, not, tell, them, and, burden, them, with, exposition, too, soon, and, too, heavy-handedly,, but, draws, it, with, curiosity, and, empathy, into, the, story,, and, indirectly, and, invisibly, as, it, were,, we’re, gathering, in, the, exposition, that, we, know,, but, we’re, not, conscious, of, it.,  , That, technique, alone, requires, years, of, practice. , And, trial, and, error. , Generally, I, can, tell, in, the, way, in, which, the, writer, describes, what, kind, of, imagination, the, writer, has,, at, least, visual, imagination. , I, can, tell, within, the, first, dialogue, scene, of, whether, or, not, this, writer,, even, in, an, action, piece, has, any, sense, of, subtext,, or, do, they, write, their, dialogue, on, the, nose. , I, mean,, there, are, certain..., When, people, perform, in, the, Olympics,, and, you, have, judges, sitting, there, giving, them, five,, six,, seven,, up, to, 10,, and, so, forth,, what, are, they, looking, for? , They, have, ways, of, judging, a, performance. , Okay? , There’s, a..., Some, of, it, is, just, sensory,, there’s, a, quality, of, relaxation, in, the, work,, there’s, a, quality, of, confidence, in, the, work,, there’s, a, quality, of, centeredness, in, the, work,, and, so, some, of, these, things, are, sort, of, ineffable,, but, you, can, judge, a, performance, of, figure, skating, based, upon, these. , Plus,, did, the, blade, land, at, a, certain, angle? , Okay? , And, so,, it’s, the, same, thing. , Writing, is, a, performance,, just, like, figure, skating., And, I, can, read, it, and, have, a, sense,, again,, of, confidence,, of, control,, of, precision,, of, one, thing, or, another. , Now,, it, doesn’t, necessarily, mean, that, by, the, end, of, the, work,, I’m, going, to, be, wowed. , But, I, can, tell, from, the, beginning, of, the, work, whether, or, not, the, writer, has, mastered, their, craft, to, a, certain, degree. , But, that, is, one, thing. , But, there, are, lots, of, people, with, superb, craftsmanship, and, nothing, to, say. , Steven, Spielberg,, brilliant, craftsmanship,, and, nothing, to, say. , M., Night, Shyamalan, can, really, light, a, scene, and, really, shoot,, and, he’s, got, a, cartoon, mind,, comic, book, mind. , He’s, got, nothing, to, say. , And, so,, the, mastery, of, craft, is, no, guarantee, overall,, on, the, other, hand,, you, may, see, people, are, still, struggling, with, the, craft,, but, they, have, passion,, they, have, insight,, and, they, really, understand, human, behavior, in, relationships,, or, whatever,, or, they, have, some, wonderful, imaginative, ideas, about, alternate, worlds, in, whatever, genre.,  , And, so,, noting, the, quality, of, the, craft, is, no, guarantee, of, excellence,, but, it’s, an, interesting, thing, that, a, lack, of, craftsmanship, and, a, lack, of, insight, into, life, seem, to, go, hand-in-hand. , It’s, no, accident, that, bad, writers, also, have, nothing, to, say. , Okay? , Having, something, to, say, seems, to, inspire, people. , All, right? , But, not, necessarily. , So,, it’s, not, an, easy, thing, necessarily,, and, they, can, make, mistakes, and, you, can, judge, books, erroneously, by, covers,, but, there, are, touchstones, you, can, use, along, the, way, that, give, you, a, sense, of, quality,, versus, banality.,  , Question:, Are, the, best, screenwriting, opportunities, in, television?,  , Robert, McKee:, Absolutely. , Well,, you’ve, got,, I, don’t, know,, countless, channels;, hundreds, perhaps, of, channels,, going, 24, hours, a, day,, consuming, material, at, that, rate. , And, so, the, number, of, series, and, specials, at, commercial, networks,, but, primarily, at, HBO, and, Showtime, and, at, the, satellite, networks,, the, subscription, networks, is, enormous. , It’s, huge. , They, can’t—and, it, seems, to, just, be, ever, expanding, in, terms, of, the, number, of, series, and, the, number, of, episodes, per, series. , And, so, when, you, have,, like,, “The, Sopranos”, ran, for, nine, years,, “Six, Feet, Under”, ran, for, seven, years, doing,, I, don’t, know,, 20, episodes, a, year. , Okay? , That’s, almost, 200, episodes, of, “Sopranos.” , When, you, have, these, kinds, of, enormities,, it, just, demands, ideas, and, quality, writing, from, the, writing, community. , And, so, the, opportunities, of, what’s, already, there, in, order, for, a, writer, to, write, episodically, are, enormous,, but, the, most, wonderful, possibility, is, that, you, create, a, series,, you’re, the, next, Dick, Wolf. , Okay? , And, why, not? , I, mean,, they, all, started, somewhere. , They, all, started, generally, as, episodic, writers, who, then, got, to, know, people, and, pitched, a, series, idea. , And, television,, without, question, is, the, most, creative, medium, to, write, today. , It, is, doing, things, with, storytelling, that, are, really, wonderful, and, exciting,, and, it, has, length, greater, than, any, novel. , It, has..., camera, moves, in, close, and, so, it, focuses, on, dialogue, scenes, like, the, theater. , On, the, other, hand,, it, can, move, out, of, doors, and, can, do, what, a, movie, can, do,, up, to, a, point. , The, budget, won’t, allow, spectacles, of, the, “Avatar”, kind,, but, not, yet.,  , But, it, can, also,, like, a, novel,, crawl, inside, of, characters', heads, because, it, can, get, in, close,, you, can, see, the, subtext, vividly, in, the, actors', performances. , I, mean,, in, a, wonderful, series, like, “Damages,”, Glenn, Close, just, turning, and, looking, at, somebody, is,, you, know,, enormously, rich, in, her, thoughts, and, feelings. , And, so, TV, takes, its, strength, from, all, three, of, the, media,, and, then, does, it, over, months,, years, of, time. , It’s, an, enormously, creative, medium. , If, it, were, a, young, writer, wanting, a, career, in, the, performance, stories,, certainly, television, would, be, my, first, choice, today.,  , Question:, Has, digital, technology, changed, screenwriting?,  , Robert, McKee:, No,, I, can’t, say, that, for, sure, because, stories, are, a, metaphor, for, life, and, as, a, result,, you’re, really, saddled, with, life. , And, so, you, can’t, get, all, digital, about, life. , Okay? , And, so, you, still, have, to, have, characters, even, if, they’re, cartoons., They, still, have, to, have, interactions, with, each, other, in, their, world., They, still, have, to, have, desires, that, they’re, pursuing., There’s, still, a, question, of, value, or, survival, or, death,, love,, hate,, truth,, lie,, courage,, cowardice,, I, mean, these, values, are, eternal. , And, so,, no,, I, think,, how, would, I, know,, I’m, not, a, scientist, of, this, kind,, but, if, I, had, to, guess, that, the, digitalness, of, things, is, part, of, the, shallowness, of, things. , And, so,, I, don’t, think, it, changes, the, way, they, tell, stories,, but, it, certainly, appears, to, have, an, effect, on, the, content, of, the, stories, that, they, tell.,  , It, certainly, changes, the, way, they, write, in, terms, of, their, inability, to, punctuate. , Their, inability, to, spell. , Their, inability, to, write, a, coherent, sentence. , Their, literacy, is, of, a, kind, I’m, not, familiar. , And, it, would, be, annoying;, it, seems, to, me, that, if, you, had, to, read, these, things,, reading, the, same, sentence, three, times, over, to, try, to, figure, out, what, the, hell, the, guy, meant, because, he, cannot, communicate, in, language. , I’ve, experienced, that, many,, many, times.,  , And, it, does, have, an, effect, of, this, kind. , Even, more, so, than, ever,, it, makes, people, who, don’t, write, disdain, screenwriting,, because, they, become, less, and, less, literate. , Now, that’s,, again,, a, general, overstatement. , Generally, speaking,, the, films, that, get, made, are, written, by, literate, people, and, that’s, why, they, get, made, because, they, really, have, characters,, they, tell, a, story., I, mean,, I’m, sure, a, film, like, “Up, in, the, Air,”, which, is, adaptation, of, a, novel,, that, screenplay, was, probably,, I, haven't, read, it,, but, I’m, sure, it, was, superbly, written,, or, George, Clooney, wouldn’t, do, it., Because, he’s, a, literate, guy. , But,, yes,, I, see, these, trends, toward, less, and, less, literacy. , But, you, know,, in, screenwriting,, literacy, is, not, a, big, problem,, not, on, the, screen, because, everything, that, is, literate, on, the, screenplay, is, going, to, be, turned, into, images, anyway. , And, so, if, the, screenwriter, cannot, describe, in, a, literate, way, it, doesn’t, really, matter. , What, really, matters, is, the, story, that, they, tell. , The, actors, are, going, to, improvise, and, rework, the, dialogue, anyway. , And, so,, if, they, can, tell, a, story, –, I, mean,, there’s, no, necessary, connection, between, literacy, and, storytelling. , A, story, can, be, danced, out, in, ballet. , A, story, can, be, mimed. , Stories, can, be, cartooned. , I, mean, any, way, in, which, people, can, communicate, stories, can, be, told,, and, language, is, only, one, of, them. , And, so, the, literacy, of, the, screenwriter,, in, that, way,, is, not, a, critical, factor, if, somehow, they, manage, to, tell, a, story, that, grabs, people.,  , But, I, think, there’s, an, intimate, connection, often, between, the, literary, sensibility, of, a, writer, and, the, quality, of, their, characters. , And, inasmuch, as, a, film, is, still, concerned, about, character, and, character, complexity,, then, the, kind, of, digital, mind, that, we’re, talking, about, is, not, really, interested, in, character, complexity, anyway. , And, so, the, sort, of, thing, they, write, is, of, a, cartoony, nature,, often. , And, which, is,, you, know,, I, thought, “Up”, was, great,, and, I, know, that, [Pete], Docter, that, had, written, it, is, certainly, a, literate, guy. , So,, I’m, just, not, an, expert, in, the, area, of, digitalness. , I, just, don’t, know.,  , Question:, Does, a, screenwriter, lack, creative, control?,  , Robert, McKee:, The, words, that, you, wrote, to, put, into, the, character’s, mouth,, the, dialogue,, that, may, or, may, not, get, to, the, screen, the, way, you, wrote, it, because, actors, often, cut,, editors, cut,, there, will, be, improvisations, and, whatnot. , So,, you, must, not, mistake, words, for, writing.,  , What, you, write, in, terms, of, characters,, in, terms, of, story,, in, terms, of, the, events, in, their, lives,, in, terms, of, the, meaning, of, everything,, and, the, emotional, impact, of, the, storytelling,, that, is, 80%, of, writing,, dialogue, and, description, is, a, relatively, minor, part, of, the, creative, process, in, the, performance, arts, of, television, and, film. , And, so,, it’s, overstating, it, and, a, bit, of, self-pitying, to, think, that, the, poor, screenwriter,, or, television, writer, doesn’t, get, what, they, wrote, to, the, screen, because, their, dialogue, gets, paraphrased. , I, mean, if, you, think, that,, if, somebody, writing, for, the, screen, actually, thinks, that, their, greatest, creative, efforts, is, in, dialogue,, then, they, should, be, writing, for, the, stage, where, every, single, word, of, your, dialogue,, by, law,, has, to, be, spoken, by, the, actors. , So,, it, just, overstates, it.,  , And, I’ll, tell, you, another, little, dirty, secret, about, film, and, television,, if, you, were, to, take, a, finished, film,, 90%, of, the, time,, or, a, finished, TV, show,, 90%, of, the, time,, and, transcribe, a, screenplay, from, it,, and, then, compare, that, to, the, screenplay, from, which, they, worked,, what, the, writer, sold,, okay? , You’d, see, clearly, that, the, screenplay, that, is, finally, embedded, in, the, finished, work, is, far, better, than, the, one, they, started, from. , And, so, that,, in, fact,, the, screenplay, gets, better, and, better, and, better, as, it, goes, through, pre-production,, production,, and, post-production. , But, when, it, does,, as, it, does, 90%, of, the, time,, the, writer, says, nothing, and, just, lets, the, world, assume, that, that, is, exactly, what, they, wrote,, the, way, it, was, finally, done. , Okay? , When, there, are, changes, that, are, detrimental,, and, that, happens, too,, then, screenwriters, and, television, writers, moan, and, groan, that, they, didn’t, shoot, it, the, way, I, wrote, it,, but, they, don’t, moan, and, groan, when, they, didn’t, shoot, it, the, way, I, wrote, it, and, it’s, better.,  , So,, we, mustn’t, feel, sorry, for, film, and, television, writers. , They, understand, the, reality, that, in, fact, polish, and, revision..., it’s, going, to, be, edited, finally..., that, there’s, other, artists, between, them, and, the, finished, product. , If, they, care, about, that, so, deeply,, then, they, should, be, writing, novels.,  , Question:, Does, a, script, that, is, never, made, into, a, film, have, inherent, value?,  , Robert, McKee:, The, vast,, vast, majority, of, all, novels, written, never, get, published. , The, vast,, vast, majority, of, all, plays, written, never, get, performed. , The, vast,, vast, majority, of, paintings, painted, never, get, hung, on, a, wall. , The, vast,, vast, majority, of, songs, written, never, get, sung, in, public. , I, mean,, that’s, the, nature, of, things. , Okay? , And, so,, again,, that, screenwriting, is, like, everything, else, in, the, arts, is, a, tautology. , And, so,, yeah,, of, course, the, vast, number, of, every, act, of, creativity, in, whatever, art, form, never, reaches, the, world, because, the, vast, majority, of, all, of, it, is, shit., And, then, there’s, those, poor, little, gems, of, things, that, never—that, do, get, buried,, unfortunately. , And, then, a, lot, of, crap, does, get, to, the, world. , And, so,, it’s, all, unfair. , It’s, just, all, unfair. , Okay? , But,, the, question, is,, does, writing, a, screenplay, that, never, gets, made, is, it, of, value? , Of, course,, it’s, enormously, valuable. , Because,, to, generalize, again,, most, screenwriters,, even, the, most, talented, of, screenwriters,, their, first, 10, screenplays, that, they, write, never, get , made. , Oliver, Stone,, Lawrence, Kasdan,, Akiva, Goldsman,, I, mean, on, and, on. , I, could, name, brilliant, screenwriters, who, are, now, very, successful, who, spent, the, first, 10,, even, 15,, years, of, their, writing, lives, writing, screenplays, that, nobody, wanted,, and/or, novels, that, probably, nobody, published, and, so, forth. , And, so, that, unproduced, screenplay,, or, unpublished, novel, is, enormously, beneficial, to, the, writer, because, you, have, to, fail,, you, have, to, create, at, least, 10, unproduced—be, willing,, at, least,, to, produce—10, unproduced, major, works, of, story, art, in, order, to, master, the, art, form,, in, order, to, grow, up.,  , I, mean,, if, you, start, writing, when, you, are, about, 20, –, I, mean,, I, used, to, write, when, I, was, in, college,, grad, school. , And, I, had, a, wonderful, teacher,, Kenneth, Rowe. , And, I, read, my, plays, and, I, looked, at, them, and, I, thought,, my, God,, this, is, the, work, of, a, really, immature, person. , But, then, I, was, immature. , There, was, nothing, I, could, do, about, that. , Okay? , And, it, took, another, 15, years, of, life, to,, when, I, went, back, to, writing,, to, be, able, to, write, something, of, quality. , So, while, you’re, writing, screenplays, or, novels, nobody, wants,, you’re, also, living,, gathering, insight, into, yourself, as, a, human, being, and, all, that, becomes, material, for, your, future, writing. , So,, indeed,, those, unproduced,, unpublished, works, are, extremely, important. , They, have, to, be, written, in, order, for, the, writer, to, finally, achieve, their, first, success.,  , I, mean,, you, read, about, these, things, in, the, paper, that, a, 23-year, old, writer, gets, first, novel, published,, or, memoir, published, or, first, screenplay, produced., And, so, these, things, happen,, and, they’re, just, there, to, annoy, the, really, good, writers, that, are, going, to, take, 10, years, to, make, it. , But, when, they, finally, do,, they’re, going, to, produce, works, of, real, quality. , So,, sure. , Those, unproduced, works, are, very, important.,  , Question:, Do, you, think, our, culture, is, getting, better, or, worse, at, telling, stories?,  , Robert, McKee:, Oh,, in, terms, of, the, skill, of, executing, stories,, I, would, say, we’re, getting, better. , That’s, one, thing. , Okay,, I, think, it’s, clear. , For, example,, I, mentioned, the, series,, “Damages,”, and, in, fact, there, was, just, an, article, in, New, York, Magazine, the, other, day, about, “Damages”, and, the, brilliant, way, in, which, that, series, does, something, that, really, has, never, been, explored, quite, that, way, before. , They, use, flash-forwards, as, hooks. , They, give, you, glimpses, of, the, future,, but, only, glimpses,, and, so, they, put, you, in, a, state, of, semi-dramatic, irony. , You, know, more, than, the, character, knows., The, character’s, going, to, die. , Okay,, you, know, that. , This, character, is, going, to, die. , Then, you, go, and, flash-forward, to, the, death,, all, right? , And, now, you, watch..., you, go, back, and, you, watch, them, in, the, present. , So,, you, know, what, he, doesn’t, know. , You, know, he’s, going, to, die,, but, you, don’t, know, how, or, why, he’s, going, to, die. , And, so,, and, you, don’t, know, who, did, it,, who, killed, him,, and, so, forth. , And, so, there’s, lots, of, hooky, questions, and, curiosity,, but, it’s, also, a, bit, of, dramatic, irony. , That’s, amazing., When, you, see, it,, you, wonder, why, hasn’t, this, been, done, before? , So,, in, terms, of, executing, stories,, I, would, say, that, the, techniques, are, better, than, ever.,  , In, terms, of, the, content, of, the, stories,, that’s, another, question. , And, in, terms, of, what, these, stories, are, about,, the, depth, to, which, they, bring, their, characters,, I, would, say,, no. , The, stories, are, more, shallow, overall. , And, that’s, a, huge, generalization. , But, post-modernism, itself,, by, definition,, means, shallowness. , It, means, a, satire, of, the, techniques, of, writing. , Okay? , Calling, attention, to, the, techniques, of, writing,, and, that,, of, course,, divorces, you, from, the, content, by, the, very, nature, of, it. , And, so, in, this, post-post-modern, world,, or, wherever, we, are, now,, I, would, say, that, as, a, grand, generalization,, that, the, content, of, stories, are, not, the, quality, that, they, were, in, the, 50, golden, years, from, the, 1920’s, to, the, 1970’s, on, stage,, page, and, screen,, every, where, in, the, world,, especially, the, English-speaking, world,, the, films,, the, plays,, and, the, novels, of, that, period, were, magnificent, in, content.,  , And, so, we’ve, learned, to, be, more, clever,, more, experimental,, and, more, skilled,, often,, in, the, telling, of, stories, today,, but, I, can’t, say, that, the, content, is, what, it, used, to, be.,  , Question:, Are, you, optimistic, about, the, future, of, storytelling?, Robert, McKee:, I, never, lose, faith, in, story,, film, may, come, and, go, as, an, art, form,, and, art, forms, have, come, and, gone. , Opera,, more, and, less,, came, and, went, and, then, just, gets, revived, endlessly. , There’s, very, little, cutting, edge, opera, today. , There, are, art, forms, that, rise, up, and, dominate, a, period, of, time, in, human, history, and, then, recede. , And, so, film, goes, though, that, and, recedes. , So, what,, because, there, will, always, be, story. , And, the, medium, of, the, future,, I, think,, is, television. , But, certainly, the, novel, and, the, theater, is, still, alive, and, well,, for, the, most, part,, despite, some, pretty, mediocre, storytelling.,  , And, so,, the, art, of, storytelling,, the, art, of, story,, I, never, worry, about. , People, will, always, tell, stories, and, they, will, tell, really, great, stories, and, beautiful, stories. , But, the, medium, of, the, future,, the, medium, that, writers, choose, to, do, what, is, the, best, work, in, the, future, that, changes.,  , Human, beings..., a, great, critic, said, once,, Kenneth, Burke, said,, “Stories, are, equipment, for, living.” , Human, beings, need, storytelling, in, order, to, make, sense, out, of, life,, in, order, to, live, as, well, and, civilized, as, a, human, being, can., And, so, they, will, go, to, the, storyteller, for, meaningful, emotional, experiences, that, they, cannot, get, from, life,, and, then, it’s, just, a, matter, of, which, medium, the, storytellers, of, the, future, choose, to, dominate, that, period, in, time,, and, then, that, too, will, change, in, time.,  , Question:, Do, we, need, stories, more, today, than, we, used, to?, Robert, McKee:, The, time, that, people, spend, in, stories, created, for, them, by, a, storytelling, artist, today, compared, to, 50, to, 100, years, ago,, it’s, triple, or, quadruple, what, it, used, to, be. , Do, they, need, it, more? , Maybe. , You, could, make, an, argument, that, the, disintegration, and, relativization, of, values, in, contemporary, society, is, so, blurring, that, people, desperately, need, stories, to, help, them, make, sense, out, of, life, because, what, we, are, used, to, agree, upon, nobody, agrees, on, anymore. , Society, is,, it’s, obvious,, but, is, so, splintered, and, so, split. , I, mean,, there’s, a, spectrum, that, runs, from, "I, am, my, brother’s, keeper", to, "Every, man, for, himself", and, we, call, that, liberals,, and, on, the, right, conservatives. , And, this, argument, over, are, we, our, brother’s, keeper,, or, is, it, every, man, for, himself,, has, never, been, more, ugly, and, fragmenting, of, society. , And, so, people, are, clustering, now,, depending, on, their, position, on, that, spectrum,, of, caring, or, not, caring, in, such, ways, that, they, cannot, even, talk, to, people, who, are, anywhere, else, on, that, spectrum.,  , And, as, a, result,, there, is, more, chaos, in, daily, life, and, then, throw, in, the, great, recession, and, a, few, other, chaoses, like, wars,, and, people, are, desperate. , And, they, need, story. , Yeah,, I, think, you, could, make, an, argument. , Now,, are, they, getting, the, quality, of, stories,, comic, or, tragic,, that, would, help, them, live, through, this, really, ugly, period, in, history? , Probably, not. , But, the, writers, do, their, best. , Because, the, writers, are, just, citizens, too,, you, know?, And, they’ve, got, no, necessarily, more, philosophical,, psychological, insight, into, this, than, anybody, else., So, the, writer, has, to, be, a, philosopher, of, a, kind, today, that, they’ve, never, had, to, be, before. , They, have, to, make, sense, out, of, a, kind, of, chaos, that, no, one, ever, confronted, before. , I, mean, the, worst, thing, that,, you, know,, a, hundred, years, ago,, and, the, worst, thing, that, could, happen, is, that, you, die. , So,, people, told, stories, about, how, to, live, well,, live, meaningfully, if, you, could,, or, tragedy. , But, death, was, the, worst, thing. , Well,, there, are, far, worse, things, now. , Far, worse, things. , And, people, are, literally, in, living, hells. , They’d, be, better, off, dead,, all, around, the, world. , The, suffering, in, the, Third, World, today, is, of, an, extreme, that, the, Third, World, has, never, suffered, before, because,, generally, speaking,, in, the, Third, World, people, didn’t, starve, to, death,, they, could, farm. , But, even, that, in, many, ways, has, been, lost, and, for, a, lot, of, reasons. , But, yeah,, the, world, is, in, a, worse, state, than, I, know, from, history,, and, people, would, probably, say,, the, Black, Plague, was, the, worse. , But, I, don’t, think, so,, because, people, understood, the, Plague:, You, get, sick, and, you, die. , Who, can, understand, the, banking, system? , Who, can, understand, love? , Who, can, understand, parenting? , I, mean, these, are, things, people, thought, they, knew;, they, don’t, know, anymore. , And, so, the, Plague, at, least, was, clear. , It, was, terrible,, but, it, was, clear.,  , The, problem, for, people, today, is, confusion, in, a, world, that, should, make, sense. , In, a, world, in, which, you, have, more, communication, than, ever,, makes, less, and, less, sense, than, ever. , And, so, you, need, storytellers, to, make, sense, out, of, that, chaos,, but, it’s, as, I, said,, it’s, a, chaos, of, a, very, different, kind, today,, and, the, writer, struggles.,  , Question:, What's, the, worst, screenplay-writing, advice, you've, ever, heard?,  , Robert, McKee:, That, there, are, certain, points,, certain, pages, in, fact,, in, which, certain, things, must, happen. , You, got, 120, pages—although, screenplays, are, getting, shorter,, because, the, emphasis, on, spectacle, becomes, greater, and, greater..., And, so,, anyways,, say, 100, pages. , And, properly, typed, in, the, right, format,, a, page, is, equal, to, a, minute, of, time. , And, so, they, say,, at, a, certain, page,, therefore, at, a, certain, minute,, more, or, less, in, the, film,, there, must, be, a, major, turning, point, of, some, kind,, or, expositional, point,, a, revelation, of, some, kind, perhaps. , And, that, the, worst, advice, is, to—many,, many, books, that, say, certain, events, must, happen, at, certain, pages, in, a, screenplay. , I, mean,, that, is, the, most, destructive, possible, thing, to, say, to, a, young, writer. , And, to, actually, destroy, a, young, talent, by, actually, convincing, him, that, he, has, to, pretzel, his, work, into, these, page, counts,, that, is, just, terrible. , But, there, is, a, rhythm,, and, in, order, to, reach, anything, like, a, satisfying, limit, of, experience, for, these, characters,, generally,, you, need, a, minimum, of, three, major, reversals. , Okay? , And, you, spread, those..., it, could, be, four, or, five,, I, mean, “Raiders, of, the, Lost, Ark”, was, in, seven, acts. , It, could, be, seven,, eight,, nine, acts, structures,, I, mean, in, “Speed,”, if, you, counted, the, major, reversals, in, a, chase, film, like, “Speed”, or, whatever,, it's, probably, nine. , Every, ten, minutes, something, explosive, happens. , Right? , But, three, is, a, minimum. , And, if, the, film, is,, again,, 100, minutes, long,, and, you’re, going, to, space, those, three, out, in, some, kind, of, fashion,, then, clearly, one, of, these, is, going, to, happen,, perhaps, at, the, very, beginning. , There, may, be, another, one, somewhere, in, the, middle, and, maybe, one, toward, the, end,, or, it, could, be, the, first, one, happens, like, 30, minutes, in,, and, the, next, one, happens, like, 90, minutes, in,, or, whatever. , Okay,, so, you, can, have,, obviously, if, they, have, 100, minutes, of, storytelling,, you, can’t, have, three, major, events, happen,, bang,, bang,, bang,, in, the, first, 15, minutes, and, then, leave, 75, minutes, worth, of, resolution. , Okay? , Nor, can, you, make, somebody, sit, there, for, 75, minutes, in, which, nothing, happens, and, then, bang,, bang,, bang, three, things, happen, in, the, last, 15, minutes. , So,, obviously, these, events, have, to, be, distributed, with, a, certain, rhythm. , Exactly, what, that, rhythm, is,, is, so, idiosyncratic, to, the, nature, of, the, story, that, is, being, told, that, you, cannot, predict,, or, demand, that, they, happen, on, certain, pages,, but, you, can, point, out, to, the, writer,, of, course, that, there, is, a, rhythm, and, that, you, have, to, hook, the, audience’s, interest,, hold, it,, and, progress, it, for, up, to, 120, minutes,, two, hours,, even, more, in, many, films. , And, to, do, that, you’ll, need, at, least, three, major, reversals, and, then, you’ve, got, to, work, out, how, to, distribute, them.,  , So,, there’s, certain, forms. , There’s, a, form,, but, by, the, page, is, a, formula,, and, that, formula, kind, of, thinking, is, very, destructive.,  , Question:, Who, are, some, of, your, favorite, screenwriters?,  , Robert, McKee:, Paul, Haggis, is, a, fine,, wonderful, writer. , Akiva, Goldsman, is, another, one. , Docter, at, Pixar. , But, I, don’t, have, favorites. , And, it’s, not, like, rock, n’, roll. , It, just, isn’t. , Where, you, can, pick, a, favorite, and, see, that, they’re, doing, something, really, innovative, in, music. , And, it, comes, out, every, six, months, there’s, a, song, or, an, album,, or, whatever. , It’s, not, like, that, because, the, time, between, starting, up, a, screenplay, or, novel, or, a, play, and, actually, seeing, it, on, stage,, page,, or, screen,, is, years, of, development, and, work, and, it, goes, on, over, long, periods, of, time. , And, so,, there, was, a, time, back, when,, 50-60, years, ago,, when, screenwriters, were, under, contract, to, studios, and, they, were, turning, out, three,, four,, or, five, screenplays, a, year. , And, directors, were, directing, two, and, three, and, four, films, a, year. , Michael, Curtiz,, who, directed, “Casablanca,”, by, the, time, he, died, had, directed, 120, films. , Well,, those, days, are, gone. , If, a, director, gets, to, direct, 12, films, in, his, lifetime,, he’d, be, a, success. , And, so, you, can’t, trace, development, and, who’s, doing, the, cutting, edge, thing, or, whatever, like, that, in, quite, those, ways.,  , I, think, the, three, guys, who, write,, produce,, and, often, direct, “Damages,”, the, two, brothers,,, Zellman, brothers, and, Kessler,, those, three, guys, are, doing, as, exciting, work, as, writers, as, anybody, in, film. , Film, is, a, very..., Hollywood, film, is, very, conservative. , They, do, not, take, risks. , Television, is, experimental. , I, mean, watching, “The, Sopranos”, or, whatever,, or, “Six, Feet, Under,”, was, an, example, of, applying, to, television, the, principle, of, the, novel, known, as, the, unreliable, narrator. , You, could, never, be, sure, when, you’re, watching, “The, Sopranos”, or, “Six, Feet, Under,”, is, this, a, dream, sequence? , Is, somebody, hallucinating, this? , Did, this, actually, happen,, or, are, they, just, having, fun, with, us,, or, whatever. , I, mean,, until, you, saw, enough, of, the, episodes, to, realize, that, the, whole, damned, episode, was, a, dream. , Nobody, does, that, in, film. , You, can’t, do, that, in, the, movies. , You, know,, it, costs, $30,, $50,, $100, million, to, make, a, film. , You, can’t, have, that, kind, of, experimentation.,  , And, when, it, comes, along,, when, such, experiments, do, happen, like, “The, Usual, Suspects,”, where, somebody, pulls, the, plug, at, the, end, and, you, realize, Kevin, Spacey, made, the, whole, damned, thing, up,, it’s, a, big..., it’s, a, form, of, cheap, surprise. , It’s, a, big,, huge,, cheap, surprise. , It’s, not, as, if, it, was, being, done, like, Luis, Bunuel, would, have, done, in, the, ‘60’s, to, really, express, the, absurdity, of, life. , When, film, does, tricky, storytelling, things, like, that, on, occasion,, it’s, not, as, if, it’s, driven, by, a, theme. , “The, Sixth, Sense,”, for, example,, and, the, mind-fuck, ending, is, just, cheap, surprise. , It’s, what, film, students, do. , But, it’s, not, as, if, that, filmmaker, has, a, deep, philosophical, understanding, that, runs, against, the, grain, of, contemporary, sense, of, reality. , I, mean,, he’s, just, having, fun, and, so, he, just, does, his, film, school, thing;, the, mind-fuck,, or, the, whatever. , And, so,, film, is, very, conservative, in, that, way. , You, can’t, experiment, like, that. , Or,, if, it’s, an, independent, film,, you, can, do, films, like, “Pi,”, you, know,, [Darren], Aranofsky’s, film,, right,, which, is, extremely, experimental, for, the, sake, of, experimental. , And, these, guys, all, went, to, film, school, and, they, were, taught, Bunuel, and, Truffaut,, and, [...],, and, Bergman., And, they, were, taught, the, classics, of, avant-garde, and, so, they, imitate, what, used, to, be, really, dangerous, stuff, in, the, ‘60’s,, and, so, today, there’s, no, avant-garde. , Today, it’s, a, retro-guard. , Today, we, have, people, going, back, to, imitating, eccentric, forms, of, the, past, because, they, went, through, film, school, and, they, think, they, should, do, that, and, that, makes, them, an, artist., And, so, I, would, say, that, as, a, storytelling, medium,, film, in, particular, has, hit, a, dead, end., Its,, as, I, said,, very, expensive,, it’s, very, conservative, and, experimentation, is, there, to, more, show, off, than, meaningful,, it’s, just, gimmickry,, it’s..., something’s, got, to, give,, and, I, don’t, know, what, the, hell, that, will, be, in, order, to, film, to, revive, itself, as, an, art, form. , As, a, form, of, entertainment, and, a, form, of, commerce,, film, is, doing, better, than, ever.,  , Question:, Why, haven't, you, had, more, of, your, own, screenplays, produced?,  , Robert, McKee:, Oh, well,, that’s, such, a, generally, unhappy, topic. , I’ve, sold,, or, optioned,, or, written, for-hire, 12, screenplays, in, Hollywood. , One, of, them, I, have, optioned, four, times, over. , And, as, far, as, all, of, my, screenplays, are, concerned,, none, of, them, ever, get, produced. , They, have, all, floundered, for, various, reasons,, no, less, than, three, times, I’ve, had, studios, change, administrations, in, the, middle, of, a, development, of, mine,, and, so, when, new, presidents, come, in, they, throw, out, everything, that’s, in, development, from, the, previous, administration., And, on, it, goes. , It’s, one, of, those, sad, development, hell, stories, where, you, make, money. , I, mean,, I, made, a, lot, of, money,, but, you, don’t, see, it, on, the, screen.,  , On, the, other, hand,, everything, I’ve, written, for, television, gets, made. , And, so,, I’ve, wrote, a, lot, of, episodic, cop, shows. , I, wrote, the, pilot, for, the, Turner, bible, mini-series. , I, wrote, “Abraham,”, directed, by, Joseph, Sargent, who, is, a, wonderful,, Emmy, Award, winning, director,, which, starred, Richard, Harris, and, Barbara, Hershey, and, Maximilian, Schell., It, was, a, fine, production. , And, so, when, I, write, for..., when, I’ve, written, for, TV,, they, get, made, and, they, hold, up, and, it’s, good, writing. , But, screenplays..., the, guild, once, did, a, study, of, how, many, of, all, the, screenplays, that, get, optioned,, how, many, actually, see, it, to, the, screen. , Out, of, every, 20, scripts, where, serious, money, is, paid,, one, gets, made. , So,, the, odds, are, 20, to, 1,, so, I’ve..., right, now,, it’s, only, 12, to, 1, for, me. , So..., but, that’s, neither, here, nor, there. , That’s, just, the, way, it, is. , It’s, just, bad, luck.,  , But, in, the, meantime,, while, I, was, going, through, that, period,, I, started, to, teach, writing, about, writing,, and, writing, about, writing.,  , Question:, What's, the, most, satisfying, part, of, teaching, screenwriting?,  , Robert, McKee:, There’s, so, many, of, them. , Every, time, one, of, my, writers, wins, an, Oscar,, a, Booker, Prize,, a, Pulitzer, Prize,, and, Emmy,, whatever,, or, they, call, me, and, they, tell, me, that, they, got, something, published, that, was, unpublishable, and, then, they, came, to, my, class,, did, a, rewrite, and, now, it’s, in, the, world,, whether, they, win, awards, or, not., But, when, people, take, what, I, teach, them,, think, it, through..., all, I, try, to, do,, I, cannot, teach, people, how, to, write,, nobody, can, teach, how, to, do, anything, like, that. , I, just, give, them, things, to, think, about. , I, just, want, them, to, think. , I, am, categorically, opposed, to, what, I, call,, the, "Vesuvius, School, of, Writing", where, it’s, all, magma. , That, the, writer, just, sits, there, and, it, just, explodes, out, of, them, and, it’s, sort, of, automatic, writing, and, they, just,, their, subconscious, mind, just,, whatever. , This, ridiculous, way, of, teaching, creative, writing,, there’s, no, craft,, there’s, no, thought,, there’s, no, rewriting,, there’s, no, understanding, by, the, writer, that, it’s, all, some, sort, of, innocent, spontaneous—that, is, such, idiocy.,  , And, so, I, can't, teach, them, how, to, write,, but, if, I, can, give, them, things, to, think, about,, things, to, consider,, elements, of, craft, and, process, so, that, their, work, improves, and, talented, people, think, about, what, they’re, doing, at, some, point, in, a, way, that, is, very, useful, to, them, as, a, result, that, I, put, the, idea, in, their, head, that, "these, are, things, that, can, be, thought, about, and, here’s, a, way, to, think, about, it." , It, doesn’t, give, you, the, answers;, it, just, raises, the, right, questions. , If, I, can, get, writers, to, ask, the, right, questions, of, their, own, work, and, find, answers, based, upon, insights, that, they’ve, gained, from, my, writing,, my, lecturing,, then, my, day, is, made.,  , Question:, What, was, it, like, seeing, yourself, as, a, character, in, the, film, "Adaptation?",  , Robert, McKee:, I, took, my, son, to, a, screening, at, Sony. , And, it’s, one, thing..., I’ve, seen, myself, on, screen, many, times, because, I’ve, done, umpteen, TV, series, when, I, lived, in, England, and, interviews, on, TV,, so, it’s, not, surprising,, even, though, I, myself, played, myself, in, another, movie, called,, “20, Dates.” , And, so, it, wasn’t, that, big, a, thing, to, see, Brian, Cox, do, me. , But, imagine, what, it, would, be, like, for, a, son, to, see, his, father, portrayed, in, a, major, motion, picture. , And, so, he, came, out, of, the, screening, and, I, said,, “Paul,, what, did, you, think?” , And, he, said,, “Dad,, he, nailed, you.”,  , That, whole, thing, came, about, as, I, was, sitting, in, my, office, one, day, working, and, the, phone, rang, and, it, was, a, producer,, Ed, Saxon,, calling, from, New, York, with, a, very, apologetic, tone, saying,, “This, is, the, most, embarrassing, phone, call, I’ve, ever, had, to, make. , I, don’t, know, what, to, do,, but, here’s, the, situation. , There’s, a, screenwriter, named, Charlie, Kaufman. , He’s, written, a, screenplay, and, he’s, made, you, a, character, in, it,, and, he, has, freely, quoted, from, your, lectures, and, quoted, from, your, book, without, permission,, without, copyright. , We, don’t, know, what, to, do.” , I, said,, “Well,, send, it, to, me,, I’ll, read, it. , And, I’ll, give, you, a, sense, of, what, I, think.” , And, so, I, read, it, and, I, saw, what, he, needed, to, do. , He, was, trying, to, write, this, film, about, the, worse, case, of, writer’s, block, in, history,, and, he, needed, an, antagonist. , And, he, needed, somebody, to, represent, Hollywood, in, an, antagonistic, way. , But, in, a, way, that, would, cut, both, ways. , And, so, he, had, twin, brothers. , One, loves, my, book, and, is, writing, a, huge, action, piece, with, great, success. , The, other, is, struggling, to, make, an, independent, film, and, this, is, the, inner, conflict, in, Charlie, Kaufman, and, many, writer/directors, like, him. , How, to, make, a, commercial, art, movie. , Okay? , And, so, he, needed, my, character, to, have, something, to, push, against.,  , The, third, act, of, that, script, was, awful. , He, just, ran, out, of, ideas. , It, was, really, awful. , And, so, I, called, Ed, Saxon, back, and, I, said,, well, first,, I, called, William, Goldman,, and, I, said,, “Bill,, they’re, trying, to, make, a, movie, and, they’ve, made, me, a, character, in, it. , What, should, I, do?” , And, he, said,, “Don’t, do, it.” , And, I, said,, “Why, not?” , And, he, said,, “It’s, Hollywood. , If, they’re, out, to, getcha,, they’ll, getcha.” , I, said,, “But, I’m, going, to, ask, for, and, I’m, going, to, get, control, over, the, casting.” , He, said,, “Okay,, okay,, let’s, say, you, got, control, of, the, casting. , Who, do, you, want?” , I, said,, “Gene, Hackman.” , He, said,, “Fine. , It’ll, be, Gene, Hackman, with, big, bows, of, purple, bows, around, his, neck. , If, they’re, gonna, getcha, Bob,, they’re, gonna, getcha. , Don’t, do, it.”,  , So, then, I, called, my, son, and, I, said,, “Paul,”, and, I, told, him,, and, he, said,, “Dad,, do, it.” , And, I, said,, “But, William, Goldman, said,, they, could, satirize, me.” , He, says,, “So, what?” , He, says,, “You’re, going, to, be, a, character, in, a, major, motion, picture. , What, difference, does, it, make?” , And, so, I, thought, about, it, and, I, thought,, if, it’s, done, with, humor,, if, it, gets, a, laugh,, I, know, I’m, a, controversial, person, and, so, I, called, Ed, back, and, I, said,, "If, we, have, fun, then, I’ll, play, his, villain, for, him,, but, if, two, things..., one,, I, have, to, have, a, say, in, the, casting., Two,, the, third, act, sucks, and, I, can’t, be, a, character, in, a, bad, movie., Three,, I, want, my, redeeming, scene.", And, so, they, agreed, to, all, of, that, and, so, we, had, many,, many, meetings, over, the, act, three, problems, until, it, got, to, a, point, where, I, would, finally, agree. , And, then, of, course,, my, redeeming, scene, in, the, bar,, which, becomes, a, pivotal, scene,, I, think, Charlie, understood, from, that, scene, that, even, McKee, couldn’t, help, him. , And, that’s, why, Donald, writes, Act, 3. , And, if, you, watch, the, film, carefully, you’ll, realize, that, Charlie’s, character, only, writes, the, first, two, acts, and, then, he, brings, in, Donald, from, Hollywood, and, Act, 3, is, Donald’s, version, of, an, Act, 3. , Right?,  , And, then, I, asked, for, a, list, of, the, actors, that, they, were, thinking, of, casting, and, they, gave, me, a, list. , Surprisingly,, because, see, I, didn’t, know, whether, this, could, be, the, Dan, Aykroyd,, Danny, Devito, School, of, Casting,, right? , But, the, list, they, gave, me, was, the, top, 10, middle-aged, British, actors, alive;, from, Christopher, Plummer, to, Michael, Caine. , And, on, that, list, was, Brian, Cox. , And, I, said,, start, there, and, ask, him. , And, they, didn’t, even, know, who, he, was. , The, casting, director, knew,, of, course,, but, I, said,, "He’s, the, best, British, actor, you, don’t, know." , And, Brian’s, a, friend, of, mine. , And, he, was, a, student, of, mine, up, in, Glasgow. , And, I, know, Brian’s, work. , And, Brian, would, not, sentimentalize, me. , Other, actors, I, couldn’t, be, sure, because, actors, love, to, be, loved. , And, so, while, they’re, going, down, the, poor, screenwriter’s, throat, in, that, lecture, scene,, an, actor, like, Christopher, Plummer,, or, somebody, would, also, put, up,, but, I’m, doing, it, for, the, right, reasons,, I’m, kind, of, –, you, know? , And, I, didn’t, want, that, because, that’s, an, idiotic, question. , And, he, deserves, to, be, answered, in, that, tone, of, voice, so, that, he, gets, it,, the, notion, that, there’s, no, conflict,, that, real, life, is, without, conflict, is, the, most, naive, ridiculous, thought, a, person, could, have., And, right, now, you, and, I, are, in, this, interview, full, of, conflict. , As, we’re, sorting, out, ideas, and, trying, to, make, this, work,, or, whatever,, I, said, that, being, –, so, anyway..., I, didn’t, want, to, be, sentimentalized, because, I, don’t, lecture, that, way. , I, don’t, want, to, be, loved. , I, want, them, to, love, the, art. , I, want, them, to, learn, from, me, and, love, the, art,, but, I, don’t, want, groupies,, I, don’t, want, to, be, loved. , And, so, I, knew, Brian, would, do, that, and, give, that, kind, of, edge, to, it,, and, it, was, great.,  , So,, my, answer, to, the, question, is:, I, thought, it, was, wonderful. , I, loved, it.,  , Question:, What, are, some, screenwriting, lessons, for, businesspeople?,  , Robert, McKee:, Well,, in, business,, the, problem, is, persuasion,, how, to, get, people, to, do, what, you, want, them, to, do. , How, to, get, the, employees, below, you,, wherever, you, are, in, the, pyramid, of, power,, how, to, get, the, people, below, you, to, do, what, you, want, them, to, do;, how, to, persuade, the, people, above, you, and, the, board, of, directors,, or, higher, management,, or, whatever,, to, recognize, that, what, you’re, offering, is, of, real, value, and, do, things, again, to, further, your, work,, and, the, corporation, as, a, whole. , So,, the, problem, is, persuasion. , And, there, are, three, ways, to, persuade, people. , One, is, rhetoric,, and, this, is,, of, course,, the, PowerPoint, presentation, where, you, try, to, build, an, argument, out, of, facts. , This, pie, chart,, that, statistic,, this, quote, from, authority,, this, blah,, blah,, blah,, therefore, at, the, end, of, the, day,, we, should, do, this. , The, problem, with, rhetoric, and, PowerPoint, presentations, is, that, the, people, you’re, making, the, presentation, to, have, their, own, facts,, their, own, statistics,, their, own, authorities., And, while, you’re, laying, out, all, of, your, evidence,, they’re, arguing, with, you. , Silently. , Because, they, know, they, have, another, set, of, facts. , Okay? , What’s, more,, they, know, in, your, PowerPoint, presentation, you, have, left, out, everything, negative. , Everything, that’s, wrong, with, this, company,, everything, that, they, have, failed, at,, every, projection, that, says, this, is, not..., everything, that, is, negative, has, been, left, out,, and, they, know, from, business, because, they, are, in, business, too,, that, the, business, world, is, full, of, things, negative. , All, kinds, of, problems, and, labor, unions, and, government, agencies, and, who, knows, what,, okay,, that, are, in, your, way. , But, the, rhetoric, leaves, all, of, that, out. , So, they, know, you’re, lying. , They, know, that, you, are, distorting. , And, so, PowerPoint, presentations, rarely, ever, work, to, persuade, anybody.,  , A, second, way, to, persuade, is, coercion. , You, can, bribe, people,, you, can, bully, people,, you, can, seduce, people,, you, can, threaten, people,, you, can, manipulate, people, in, one, way, or, the, other,, either, by, seductions, or, by, abuse. , And, you, can, get, them, to, do, what, you, want, them, to, do, that, way. , That, is, every, day, at, the, office. , The, trouble, with, coercion, is, that, it, is, short-term. , You, might, be, able, to, bully, somebody, into, doing, what, you, want,, or, seduce, somebody, above, you, to, see, things, your, way,, but, because, it’s, not, founded, on, anything, real,, in, turn,, that, snake, will, turn, around, and, bite, you, in, the, ass. , And, so, coercion, as, a, short-term, affect, may, or, may, not, help,, but, in, long-term,, it, just, builds, resentments, and, blah,, blah.,  , The, third, way, to, persuade, people, is, with, story. , You, take, all, the, facts, that, you, would, have, used, in, a, PowerPoint, presentation,, you, take, all, the, emotional, impact, that, you, would, have, used, coercing, people,, and, you, create, out, of, that, a, story, that, imparts, those, facts, emotionally. , And, the, story, stars, you,, or, stars, the, corporation,, or, your, division, as, an, underdog, up, against, very, powerful, forces, and, admits, to, the, existence, of, the, negative. , When, you, tell, a, story,, it, isn’t, just, and, then,, and, then,, and, then,, and, we, all, lived, happily, ever, after. , It’s, that, and, then,, and, then, this, and, that,, and, that, and, this,, and, by, admitting, that, somebody, stole, our, patent, and, we, had, to, go, out, and, fight, that, in, the, court,, but, we, got, it, back,, some, competitor, stole, our, best, people,, but, we, rehired, and, we, got, even, better, people,, and, so, forth. , By, describing, the, dynamic, of, life,, and, therefore, this, product, is, now,, da,, da,, poised, to, win, the, market, share,, or, whatever.,  , By, telling, story, dynamically,, you, hook, them, emotionally,, because, everybody’s, rooting, for, an, underdog, struggling, to, succeed. , You, tell, the, story, honestly, because, you’re, admitting, all, the, negative, side,, and, you’re, telling, the, story, emotionally, because, they, get, involved, and, they, have, a, huge, stake, in, the, storytelling., Is, this, company,, or, is, this, product, going, to, win?,  , And, so, storytelling, is,, by, far,, the, greatest, leaders, of, business, and, government,, for, that, matter—people, with, great, power, gain, that, power, by, being, able, to, communicate, a, story, to, the, citizen,, to, the, workers,, to, the, board,, that, hooks, them, and, holds, them, and, pays, off. , The, trouble, with, that,, of, course,, is, it, takes, talent, to, do, that. , Not, everybody, is, a, natural, storyteller. , That’s, why, people, lean, on, PowerPoint, presentations, because, it’s, an, essay, form, and, they, can, do, that. , But, it’s, dangerous, to, tell, stories, if, you, don’t, have, talent, because, you, just, bore, people.,  , But, the, best, leaders, have, that, talent,, or, they, learn, that, craft, and, the, know, how, to, beguile, people, and, move, them, and, excite, them, with, their, visions, and, persuade, them., VIDEOS, Writing, Is, About, Conflict, 03:53, Bad, Writers, Have, Nothing, to, Say, 06:44, Storytelling, in, a, Digital, World, 08:01, MOST, POPULAR, With,
