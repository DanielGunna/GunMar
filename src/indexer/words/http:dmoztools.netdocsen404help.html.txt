URL, Notes, Glossary, In, Other, Languages, česky, -, Czech, Deutsch, -, German, Español, -, Spanish, Français, -, French, 日本語, -, Japanese, Who, is, "Robozilla"?, Robozilla, is, a, webcrawler, that, periodically, visits, all, the, websites, included, in, the, directory., When, a, linked, page, has, either, moved, or, is, not, found,, Robozilla, notes, this, fact, in, DMOZ, with, specific, codes., There, can, be, many, reasons, a, page, isn't, found,, and, you, might, take, different, actions, depending, on, the, reason., What, should, I, do, about, Robozilla, Errors?, Your, first, job, is, to, become, Sherlock, Holmes, and, figure, out, why, the, URL, isn't, responding., Below, is, a, list, of, common, reasons, for, errors, and, actions, you, might, take., Problem, Solution, There, is, a, typo, in, the, URL., An, editor, typed, in, the, URL, incorrectly., Simply, fix, the, URL., Try, adding, (or, removing), common, endings,, such, as, default.html,, default.htm,, default.asp,, index.html,, index.htm,, index.cgi,, index.mv,, index.asp,, index.php,, main.html,, main.htm,, etc., The, URL, works, for, me., The, server, may, have, been, down, when, Robozilla, crawled, the, site., After, verifying, that, the, content, of, the, site, corresponds, to, the, title, and, description, of, the, listing,, click, the, "URL, works, for, me:, Clear, Error", button., The, URL, is, dead., Maybe, the, page, moved., Go, look, for, it., Try, searching, Google;, they, may, have, cached, a, version, of, the, site, with, a, pointer, to, the, new, location., Also,, try, searching, with, Bing, or, another, search, engine, for, the, site, title, or, some, keywords, specific, to, that, site, to, see, if, there's, an, updated, URL, available., The, URL, is, dead,, I, looked, for, it,, I, have, no, idea, where, it, is, now., Leave, it, in, the, unreviewed, section, of, your, category, and, if, it, is, still, dead, next, week,, and, doesn't, contain, unique, information,, delete, it., If, the, site, is, unique, to, the, category,, you, can, leave, it, in, place,, to, recheck, after, several, weeks., What, do, the, Error, Codes, mean?, There, are, two, types, of, error, codes, that, are, presented, in, the, open, directory., The, first, set, are, positive, numbers, greater, than, 100., These, numbers, are, Errors, in, the, HTTP, protocol., If, you, see, one, of, these, numbers,, Robozilla, was, able, to, talk, to, the, server, but, not, able, to, get, at, your, document, for, some, reason, or, another., Error, codes, with, values, less, than, 0, are, errors, that, occurred, while, trying, to, talk, to, the, server, (but, not, succeeding)., This, can, by, due, to, typos, in, the, URL,, a, bad, network, connection, or, an, overloaded, or, down, server., Links, are, checked, twice, before, they, are, marked, with, an, error,, to, try, to, account, for, machines, that, are, temporarily, down., Following, are, the, most, common, error, codes, generated, by, Robozilla., A, list, of, all, error, codes, is, also, available,, in, case, you, come, across, one, not, listed,, or, you're, just, curious., Code, Meaning, 500, Server, error, Sometimes, happens, due, to, a, server, misconfiguration., Usually, this, is, transient,, and, goes, away,, but, check, first., 410, Gone, The, resource, doesn't, exist, at, all., The, page, was, removed, by, the, webmaster., 404, Not, Found, The, resource, doesn't, exist, on, this, server., The, page, may, have, been, removed,, or, the, site, has, restructured, and, the, content, now, resides, at, a, different, URL., 403, Forbidden, You, can't, see, this, resource, on, the, server., The, admin, may, have, turned, off, the, pages, because, of, load, or, for, some, other, reason., 401, Unauthorized, You, can't, see, this, resource, on, the, server., Perhaps, a, password, is, now, required,, or, the, resource, you're, looking, for, has, moved., 400, Bad, Request, Usually, occurs, due, to, a, space, in, the, URL, or, other, malformed, URL, syntax., Try, converting, spaces, to, %20, and, see, if, that, fixes, the, error., 302, Redirect, Temporarily, The, page, has, a, new, URL, temporarily, (in, theory;, in, practice,, this, is, often, used, as, a, synonym, for, code, 301)., Update, the, listing, to, the, new, URL., 301, Redirect, Permanently, The, page, has, a, new, URL., Update, the, listing, to, the, new, URL., 0, Unknown, error, Probably, a, DNS, error., -1, Unable, to, Resolve, Host, Probably, a, typo, in, the, host, name, or, they, didn't, pay, their, bill, for, their, Domain, name., -4, Can't, connect, We, can't, connect, to, the, HTTP, server., The, server, is, there, but, it, didn't, want, to, talk, to, Robozilla, on, the, specified, port., -5, Timeout, Robozilla, connected, OK,, and, sent, the, request, but, Robozilla, timed, out, waiting, to, fetch, the, page., This, happens, sometimes, on, really, busy, servers., -6, Bad, URL, There, was, a, problem, with, the, format, of, the, URL., Perhaps, http://, is, missing?, Note:, when, you, click, on, the, [edit], link, for, a, URL, missing, http://,, the, edit, page, for, the, site, comes, up, with, http://, helpfully, attached, by, the, DMOZ, software,, and, the, URL, link, therefore, works., You, still, have, to, click, Update, (not, "This, URL, works, for, me"), in, order, for, the, update, to, take, effect., -7, Server, Error, The, server, returned, an, unknown, error, code,, and, is, probably, mis-configured., The, page, may, still, show, up, okay,, but, it's, a, good, idea, to, check, it, just, in, case., -8, Domain, Name, Expired, The, domain, registration, expired;, the, domain, may, be, non-functional,, or, it, may, be, parked, (displaying, a, page, of, generic, advertising, links), or, hijacked, (claimed, by, a, new, owner,, who, is, using, the, site, for, a, different, purpose,, e.g., advertising, or, search, engine, optimization), –, or, it, may, be, reclaimed, by, its, previous, owner., Take, care, to, review, the, whois, information, for, sites, marked, with, this, code, (e.g.,, using, domaintools.com),, and, make, sure, the, content, is, still, up, to, date, as, described, in, the, listing, before, republishing., Last, update:, Tue, Nov, 15, 19:46, EST, 2016, Copyright, ©, 2016, AOL, Inc., (Terms, of, Use, -, License)]
