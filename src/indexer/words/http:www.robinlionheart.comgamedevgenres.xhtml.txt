[Genre, and, the, Video, Game, Chapter, 6, of, The, Medium, of, the, Video, Game,, by, Mark, J., P., Wolf, The, idea, of, categorization, by, genre,, and, the, notion, that, there, are, certain, conventions, present, in, each, genre,, has, been, used, in, the, study, of, literature, and, film, and, has, proven, to, be, a, useful, way, of, looking, at, both., The, idea, of, genre, has, not, been, without, difficulties,, such, as, the, defining, of, what, exactly, constitutes, a, genre,, overlaps, between, genres,, and, the, fact, that, genres, are, always, in, flux, as, long, as, new, works, are, being, produced., And, genre, study, differs, from, one, medium, to, the, next., Thomas, Schatz,, in, his, book, Hollywood, Genres,, outlines, some, of, the, distinctions, between, literary, genre, study, and, film, genre, study., He, also, notes, that, genre, study, in, the, past, often, focussed, on, subject, matter, and, neglected, the, role, of, the, audience., He, writes:, Genre, study, may, be, more, productive, if, we, complement, the, narrow, critical, focus, of, traditional, genre, analysis, with, a, broader, sociocultural, perspective., Thus,, we, may, consider, a, genre, film, not, only, as, some, filmmaker’s, artistic, expression,, but, further, as, the, cooperation, between, artists, and, audience, in, celebrating, their, collective, values, and, ideals., In, fact,, many, qualities, traditionally, viewed, as, artistic, shortcomings—the, psychologically, static, hero,, for, instance,, or, the, predictability, of, the, plot—assume, a, significantly, different, value, when, examined, as, components, of, a, genre’s, ritualistic, narrative, system.1, One, could, easily, substitute, video, game, for, film, in, the, above, quote;, video, games’, heroes, are, certainly, more, static, than, film, ones,, and, plots, are, often, even, more, predictable., And, most, of, all,, the, interactive, experience, of, playing, a, video, game, is, even, more, of, a, cooperation, between, artists, and, audiences,, who, go, beyond, celebrating, collective, values, by, applying, those, values, to, the, activity, found, in, game, play, itself., Video, game, genre, study, differs, markedly, from, literary, or, film, genre, study, due, to, the, direct, and, active, participation, of, the, audience,, through, the, surrogate, player‐character, who, acts, within, the, game’s, diegetic, world,, taking, part, in, the, central, conflict, of, the, game’s, narrative., In, regard, to, narrative,, Schatz, describes, the, general, plot, structure, of, the, genre, film, as:, establishment, (via, various, narrative, and, iconographic, cues), of, the, generic, community, with, its, inherent, dramatic, conflicts;, animation, of, those, conflicts, through, the, actions, and, attitudes, of, the, genre’s, constellation, of, characters;, intensification, of, the, conflict, by, means, of, conventional, situations, and, dramatic, confrontations, until, the, conflict, reaches, crisis, proportions;, resolution, of, the, crisis, in, a, fashion, which, eliminates, the, physical, and/or, ideological, threat, and, thereby, celebrates, the, (temporarily), well‐ordered, community.2, Apart, from, the, fact, the, video, games, often, do, not, have, happy, endings, (games, usually, end, with, a, player‐character’s, death),, Schatz’s, four, terms, describe, the, action, of, most, video, games., If, a, film, genre, represents, a, range, of, experience, for, the, audience, as, Schatz, argues,, video, games, fit, the, description, even, more, closely., In, some, ways,, player, participation, is, arguably, the, central, determinant, in, describing, and, classifying, video, games,, moreso, even, than, iconography., Iconography, versus, Interactivity, In, his, essay, The, Idea, of, Genre, in, the, American, Cinema,, Ed, Buscombe, lists, three, areas, in, which, genre, elements, may, appear, in, film:, iconography,, structure, and, theme.3, While, iconography, and, theme, may, be, applicable, to, narrative‐based, video, games,, other, games, like, Tetris, and, Ataxx, are, abstract, to, the, point, where, little, or, no, narrative, exists,, and, some, games,, like, Video, Pinball, and, Scrabble, are, patterned, after, relatively, nonnarrative, activities,, and, do, not, contain, much, in, the, way, of, diegetic, worlds, populated, by, characters., While, the, ideas, of, iconography, and, theme, may, be, appropriate, tools, for, analyzing, Hollywood, films, as, well, as, many, video, games,, another, area,, interactivity,, is, an, essential, part, of, every, game’s, structure, and, a, more, appropriate, way, of, examining, and, defining, video, game, genres., Just, as, different, forms, of, dance, (foxtrot,, waltz,, ballet,, jazz), are, defined, by, how, the, dancers, move, rather, than, how, they, look,, an, examination, of, the, variety, and, range, of, video, games, reveals, the, inadequacy, of, classification, by, iconography, of, even, narrative‐based, games., While, some, video, games, can, be, classified, in, a, manner, similar, to, that, of, films, (we, might, say, that, Outlaw, is, a, Western,, Space, Invaders, science, fiction,, and, Combat, a, war, game),, classification, by, iconography, ignores, the, fundamental, differences, and, similarities, which, are, to, be, found, in, the, player’s, experience, of, the, game., Outlaw, and, Combat,, both, early, games, for, the, Atari, 2600,, are, very, similar, in, that, both, simply, feature, player‐characters, maneuvering, and, shooting, at, each, other, in, a, field, of, obstacles, on, a, single,, bounded, screen, of, graphics,, with, cowboys, in, one, game, and, tanks, in, the, other., In, a, similar, vein,, Activision’s, Chopper, Command, for, the, Atari, 2600, is, essentially, a, version, of, Defender, with, helicopters, replacing, the, spaceships., Conversely,, an, iconographic, analysis, of, Space, Invaders,, Spaceward, Ho!,, Defender,, and, Star, Wars,, as, well, as, many, other, games,, would, consider, them, all, science, fiction, even, though, they, vary, widely, in, player, experience., As, narrative, games, grow, more, complex, and, cinematic,, iconographic, and, thematic, generic, classifications, from, film, will, be, able, to, be, applied, more, usefully,, but, interactivity, will, always, be, an, important, factor, in, the, way, the, games, are, experienced., Genres, based, on, interactivity, also, avoid, some, of, the, problems, found, in, literary, and, film, genres., In, Genre, and, Critical, Methodology,, Andrew, Tudor, points, out, that, in, relying, on, theme, for, the, determination, of, genre,, one, is, confronted, with, the, difficulties, in, isolating, a, film’s, (or, rather,, film, author’s), intentions.4, In, a, video, game,, there, is, almost, always, a, definite, objective, that, the, player, strives, to, complete, (or, find, and, complete,, as, in, the, case, of, Myst),, and, in, doing, so, very, specific, interactions, are, used., Thus, the, intention,, of, the, player‐character, at, least,, is, often, clear,, and, can, be, analyzed, as, a, part, of, the, game., The, game’s, objective, is, a, motivational, force, for, the, player,, and, this,, combined, with, the, various, forms, of, interactivity, present, in, the, game,, are, useful, places, to, start, in, building, a, set, of, video, game, genres., The, object, of, the, game, can, be, multiple, or, divided, into, steps,, placing, the, game, in, more, than, one, genre,, just, as, a, film’s, theme, and, iconography, can, place, a, film, in, multiple, genres, (the, film, Blade, Runner,, for, example,, fits, both, science, fiction, and, hard‐boiled, detective, genres)., The, main, objective, in, Pac‐Man, by, which, a, player, gains, points, and, advances, levels,, for, example,, is, the, eating, of, the, yellow, dots., In, order, to, do, so, successfully,, the, player‐character, must, avoid, the, pursuing, ghosts,, and, also, navigate, a, maze., Thus, while, Pac‐Man, may, be, primarily, classified, (according, to, the, terms, below), as, a, Collecting, game,, we, may, also, classify, it, as, an, Escape, or, Maze, game,, albeit, secondarily., By, beginning, with, the, interaction, required, by, the, game’s, primary, objective,, we, can, start, to, divide, the, wide, variety, of, video, games, into, a, series, of, interactive, genres., Interactive, Genres, for, Classifying, Video, Games, The, following, list, of, genres, based, on, interactivity, can, be, used, in, conjunction, with, the, existing, taxonomy, of, iconographically, or, thematically, based, genres, (like, those, of, film), when, attempting, to, categorize, video, games., The, genres, below, take, into, consideration, the, dominant, characteristics, of, the, interactive, experience, and, the, games’, goals, and, objectives,, and, the, nature, of, the, game’s, player‐character, and, player, controls., Also,, certain, genres, listed, here, (Diagnostic,, Demo,, Educational,, Puzzle,, Simulation,, and, Utility), contain, programs, which, are, arguably, not, games,, but, since, they, appear, as, cartridges, or, discs, in, a, form, similar, to, game, cartridges, and, discs, (and, are, treated, as, such, by, many, game, collectors),, and, because, they, sometimes, contain, gamelike, elements, (such, as, Mario, Teaches, Typing),, they, have, been, included, here, for, the, sake, of, completeness., In, the, culture, surrounding, the, video, game,, certain, generic, terms, such, as, the, Shoot, ’Em, Up, are, already, established, and, in, use, among, players,, and, these, terms, and, distinctions, are, reflected, in, the, proposed, list, of, terms, below., Some, of, these, genres, overlap, commonly‐used, genres, of, moving, imagery, (such, as, Adaptation,, Adventure,, Chase),, while, others,, such, as, Escape,, Maze,, or, Shoot, ’Em, Up,, are, specific, to, video, games, and, reflect, the, interactive, nature, of, the, medium., These, genre, terms, regard, the, nature, of, interactivity, in, the, game, itself, rather, than, ask, whether, the, game, is, single‐player,, multiple‐player,, or, designed, to, be, playable, over, a, network., Due, to, the, different, types, of, action, and, objectives, that, can, occur, in, a, single, game,, games, can, often, be, cross‐listed, in, two, or, more, genres., Also,, some, games,, like, M*A*S*H, or, Rebel, Assault,, feature, different, sequences, or, scenarios, each, of, which, can, be, categorized, into, different, genres., Video, games, used, as, examples, here, include, arcade, video, games,, home, video, games,, home, computer, games,, and, in, a, few, cases,, networked, games., The, format, of, this, list, is, patterned, after, the, Library, of, Congress, Moving, Imagery, Genre‐Form, Guide, compiled, by, Brian, Taves, (chair),, Judi, Hoffman,, and, Karen, Lund,, whose, work, was, the, inspiration, and, model, for, this, list., Genres, covered, in, this, list:, Abstract,, Adaptation,, Adventure,, Artificial, Life,, Board, Games,, Capturing,, Card, Games,, Catching,, Chase,, Collecting,, Combat,, Demo,, Diagnostic,, Dodging,, Driving,, Educational,, Escape,, Fighting,, Flying,, Gambling,, Interactive, Movie,, Management, Simulation,, Maze,, Obstacle, Course,, Pencil‐and‐Paper, Games,, Pinball,, Platform,, Programming, Games,, Puzzle,, Quiz,, Racing,, Role‐Playing,, Rhythm, and, Dance,, Shoot, ’Em, Up,, Simulation,, Sports,, Strategy,, Table‐Top, Games,, Target,, Text, Adventure,, Training, Simulation,, and, Utility., Abstract, Games, which, have, nonrepresentational, graphics, and, often, involve, an, objective, which, is, not, oriented, or, organized, as, a, narrative., Often, the, objective, involves, construction, or, visiting, or, filling, every, part, of, the, screen, (as, in, Tetris,, Qix,, Pipe, Dream,, or, Q*bert),, or, destruction, or, emptying, of, the, screen, (as, in, Breakout, or, Pac‐Man)., Characters, appearing, in, abstract, games, may, be, anthropomorphic, in, design, (such, as, Q*bert),, but, usually, do, not, attempt, to, represent, real, world, animals, or, people, or, their, behaviors., Abstraction, is,, of, course,, a, matter, of, degree,, though, it, is, usually, possible, to, discern, whether, or, not, the, game, was, intended, to, be, deliberately, representational., For, example,, despite, their, simple,, blocky, graphics,, early, Atari, 2600, games, such, as, Basketball, or, Street, Racer, attempt, to, represent, people, and, race, cars,, which, is, reflected, not, only, in, their, design, but, in, their, interaction, within, the, game., Nor, should, the, term, be, used, for, games, which, are, adaptations, of, games, existing, in, different, media,, such, as, Checkers, or, Othello,, which, are, abstract, in, design, and, play,, but, which, are, nonetheless, adaptations, and, thus, representations, of, games, from, other, media., Examples:, Arkanoid;, Amidar, (with, Collecting);, Ataxx;, Block, Out, (with, Puzzle);, Breakout;, Marble, Madness;, Pac‐Man, (with, Collecting,, Escape,, and, Maze);, Pipe, Dream;, Q*bert;, Qix, (with, Collecting);, Super, Breakout;, Tempest, (with, Shoot, ’Em, Up);, Tetris, (with, Puzzle), Adaptation, Games, based, on, activities, adapted, from, another, medium, or, gaming, activity,, such, as, sports,, table‐top, games,, board, games,, card, games,, or, games, whose, action, closely, follows, a, narrative, from, a, work, existing, in, another, medium,, such, as, a, book,, short, story,, comic, book,, graphic, novel,, or, play., This, involves, such, questions, as, how, the, original, work, is, changed, to, allow, for, interactivity, and, the, completion, of, an, objective,, or, in, the, case, of, adapted, games,, how, the, original, activity, changes, as, a, result, of, being, adapted., This, term, should, not, be, used, for, games, which, use, the, same, characters, as, existing, works, in, another, medium, but, make, no, attempt, to, even, loosely, follow, plots, or, imitate, activities, found, in, those, works., Home, video, games, and, computer, games, may, also, be, adaptations, of, arcade, video, games,, in, which, case, they, are, usually, reduced, in, graphic, detail,, complexity,, or, speed, when, compared, with, the, original., In, a, few, cases,, arcade, games,, such, as, Computer, Space, (1971),, are, adaptations, of, mainframe, computer, games., This, term, should, only, be, applied, to, Simulation, games, when, they, are, adapted, from, games, or, gaming, activities, in, other, media., Note:, See, Sports,, Table‐Top, Games,, Board, Games,, Card, Games,, Pencil‐and‐Paper, Games,, and, Simulation., Examples:, Adapted, from, card, games:, Casino;, Eric’s, Ultimate, Solitaire;, Ken, Uston, Blackjack/Poker., Adapted, from, cartoons:, Spy, Vs, Spy;, The, Simpsons., Adapted, from, comic, books:, Spiderman,, X‐Men,, Teenage, Mutant, Ninja, Turtles., Adapted, from, film:, Tron;, Star, Wars;, Krull;, Muppet, Treasure, Island., Adapted, from, pencil‐and‐paper, games:, Hangman;, Tic, Tac, Toe., Adapted, from, sports:, American, Football;, Atari, Baseball;, Hot, Shots, Tennis., Adapted, from, table‐top, games:, Pong;, Sure, Shot, Pool;, Virtual, Pool., Adapted, from, television, game, shows:, Family, Feud;, Jeopardy;, Joker’s, Wild;, Password;, The, Price, is, Right;, Tic‐Tac‐Dough;, $25,000, Pyramid;, Wheel, of, Fortune, Adventure, Games, which, are, set, in, a, world, usually, made, up, of, multiple,, connected, rooms, or, screens,, involving, an, objective, which, is, more, complex, than, simply, catching,, shooting,, capturing,, or, escaping,, although, completion, of, the, objective, may, involve, several, or, all, of, these., Objectives, usually, must, be, completed, in, several, steps,, for, example,, finding, keys, and, unlocking, doors, to, other, areas, to, retrieve, objects, needed, elsewhere, in, the, game., Characters, are, usually, able, to, carry, objects,, such, as, weapons,, keys,, tools,, and, so, on., Settings, often, evoke, a, particular, historical, time, period, and, place,, such, as, the, middle, ages, or, Arthurian, England,, or, are, thematically, related, to, content‐based, genres, such, as, Science, Fiction,, Fantasy,, or, Espionage., This, term, should, not, be, used, for, games, in, which, screens, are, only, encountered, in, one‐way, linear, fashion,, like, the, levels, in, Donkey, Kong,, or, for, games, like, Pitfall!, which, are, essentially, limited, to, running,, jumping,, and, avoiding, dangers, (see, Obstacle, Course)., Nor, should, the, term, be, used, to, refer, to, games, like, Dragon’s, Lair,, Gadget,, or, Star, Trek:, Borg,, which, do, not, allow, a, player, to, wander, and, explore, its, world, freely,, but, strictly, limit, outcomes, and, possible, narrative, paths, to, a, series, of, video, sequences, and, linear, progression, through, a, predetermined, narrative, (see, Interactive, Movies)., Note:, For, adventure, games, which, are, primarily, text‐based,, see, Text, Adventure., For, related, games, similar, in, theme, to, adventure, games,, see, also, Obstacle, Course, and, Interactive, Movies., Examples:, Adventure, (for, the, Atari, 2600);, E.T., The, Extraterrestrial, (with, Adaptation);, Haunted, House,, Krull, (with, Adaptation);, Myst, (with, Puzzle);, Raiders, of, the, Lost, Ark, (with, Adaptation);, Spy, Vs, Spy, (with, Adaptation);, Superman, (with, Adaptation);, games, in, the, Tomb, Raider, series;, Venture;, games, from, the, Daggerfall, series;, games, from, the, Ultima, series, Artificial, Life, Games, which, involve, the, growth, and/or, maintenance, of, digital, creatures, of, some, sort,, which, can, die, without, the, proper, care, by, the, player., Often, growth, and, the, happiness, or, contentedness, of, the, characters, are, the, goals, of, the, game., (Whether, or, not, all, such, programs, constitute, games, is, debatable.), The, term, should, not, be, used, for, games, which, deal, with, the, allocation, of, resources, or, games, which, are, primarily, concerned, with, management, (see, Management, Simulation)., Examples:, AquaZone;, Babyz;, Catz;, Creatures;, Dogz;, The, Little, Computer, People;, The, Sims, (with, Management, Simulation), Board, Games, Games, which, are, an, adaptation, of, existing, board, games, (see, Adaptation), or, games, which, are, similar, to, board, games, in, their, design, and, play, even, if, they, did, not, previously, exist, as, board, games,, like, Fooblitzky, and, Jones, in, the, Fast, Lane., Games, of, this, genre, include, either, classic, board, games, like, Chess,, Checkers,, or, Backgammon,, or, trademarked, ones, such, as, Scrabble, or, Monopoly., This, term, should, not, be, used, for, games, adapted, from, games, such, as, pool, or, table, tennis,, in, which, physical, skills, are, involved, (see, Table‐Top, Games),, nor, for, games, adapted, from, games, which, require, only, paper, and, a, pencil, to, play,, such, as, Hangman, or, Tic‐Tac‐Toe, (see, Pencil‐and‐Paper, Games),, nor, for, games, adapted, from, games, which, are, primarily, card‐based, and, do, not, use, a, board, (see, Card, Games)., Three, games, made, by, Philips/Magnavox,, Conquest, of, the, World,, Quest, for, the, Rings,, and, The, Great, Wall, Street, Fortune, Hunt,, required, a, board, game, to, be, used, along, with, the, video, game, itself., Note:, Most, Board, Games,, though, not, all,, can, be, cross‐listed, with, Adaptation,, and, many, can, also, be, cross‐listed, with, Strategy., Examples:, Backgammon;, Battleship;, Clue;, Conquest, of, the, World;, Fooblitzky;, The, Great, Wall, Street, Fortune, Hunt;, Jones, in, the, Fast, Lane;, Monopoly;, Othello;, Quest, for, the, Rings;, Scrabble;, Stratego;, Video, Checkers;, Video, Chess, Capturing, Games, in, which, the, primary, objective, involves, the, capturing, of, objects, or, characters, that, move, away, from, and, try, to, evade, the, player‐character., This, may, involve, stopping, the, object, or, character, (as, in, Gopher, or, Keystone, Kapers),, or, closing, off, their, access, to, an, escape, route, (as, in, Surround, or, in, the, light, cycle, section, of, the, arcade, game, Tron)., This, term, should, not, be, used, for, games, in, which, objects, or, characters, do, not, move, (see, Collecting), or, do, not, actively, try, to, avoid, the, player‐character, (see, Catching),, nor, should, it, be, used, for, Strategy, games, (such, as, Chess, and, Checkers), involving, the, capturing, of, pieces, which, are, controlled, by, the, player,, but, which, are, not, player‐characters, directly, representing, the, player, in, the, game., Note:, Not, necessary, to, cross‐list, with, Chase, as, this, is, implied, in, Capturing., Many, games, with, more, than, one, player, can, be, cross‐listed, with, Escape,, as, game, play, often, involves, player‐characters, alternately, trying, to, capture, one, another, and, escape, from, one, another., Capturing, objectives, also, occur, briefly, in, some, games;, for, example,, in, Pac‐man, after, eating, a, power, pill, when, the, ghosts, can, be, chased, and, eaten,, or, the, capturing, of, criminals, in, Superman., Examples:, Gopher;, Hole, Hunter;, Keystone, Kapers;, Surround, (with, Escape);, Take, the, Money, and, Run;, Texas, Chainsaw, Massacre;, the, light, cycle, game, in, Tron, Card, Games, Games, which, are, adaptations, of, existing, card, games,, or, games, which, are, essentially, like, card, games, in, that, they, are, primarily, card‐based, (such, as, various, solitaire, computer, games)., While, most, Card, Games, use, the, standard, four‐suit, deck,, some, games, use, specialized, cards, (such, as, 1000, Miles,, a, shareware, game, which, is, an, adaptation, of, Parker, Brothers’, Milles, Bornes, racing, card, game)., This, term, should, not, be, used, for, Trivia, Games, which, are, primarily, question‐and‐answer, games., Note:, Not, necessary, to, cross‐list, with, Adaptation,, as, that, is, implied, in, Card, Games., Many, card, games, which, involve, betting, can, also, be, cross‐listed, with, Gambling., Examples:, 1000, Miles, (with, Racing);, Blackjack, (with, Gambling);, Casino, (with, Gambling);, Eric’s, Ultimate, Solitaire;, Ken, Uston, Blackjack/Poker, (with, Gambling);, Montana;, Video, Poker, (with, Gambling), Catching, Games, in, which, the, primary, objective, involves, the, catching, of, objects, or, characters, that, do, not, actively, try, to, evade, the, player‐character., If, the, objects, or, characters, are, in, motion,, it, is, usually, along, a, predetermined, path, and, independent, of, the, movements, of, the, player‐character., In, some, cases, the, player‐character, can, affect, the, motion, of, the, objects, or, characters, (such, as, in, Stampede,, where, the, player‐character, can, nudge, the, cattle, forward),, but, at, no, time, do, the, objects, or, characters, try, to, actively, avoid, the, player‐character., This, term, should, not, be, used, for, games, in, which, objects, or, characters, do, not, move, (see, Collecting), or, games, in, which, they, actively, try, to, avoid, the, player‐character, (see, Capturing)., Nor, should, the, term, be, used, for, games, that, require, timing, in, order, to, use, moving, objects,, such, as, the, moving, logs, in, Frogger,, or, the, swinging, vines, in, Pitfall!,, nor, for, Sports, games, with, balls, which, are, thrown,, bounced,, or, caught,, as, these, objects, are, used, and, reused, but, not, caught, and, removed, from, the, game., Examples:, Alpha, Beam, with, Ernie, (with, Educational);, Big, Bird’s, Egg, Catch;, Circus, Atari,, Fishing, Derby;, Lost, Luggage;, Stampede;, Quantum;, and, games, 21, through, 27, in, Street, Racer, Chase, See, Catching,, Capturing,, Driving,, Escape,, Flying,, and, Racing, Collecting, Games, in, which, the, primary, objective, involves, the, collecting, of, objects, that, do, not, move, (such, as, Pac‐Man, or, Mousetrap),, or, the, surrounding, of, areas, (such, as, Qix, or, Amidar)., Often, scoring, in, these, games, is, determined, by, the, number, of, objects, collected, or, areas, bounded., Collecting, here, can, mean, simply, running, over, or, hitting, objects, which, then, disappear, (as, the, dots, in, Pac‐Man,, or, the, balloons, in, Prop, Cycle)., This, term, should, not, be, used, for, games, in, which, objects, or, characters, sought, by, the, player‐character, are, in, motion, (see, Catching), or, games, in, which, they, actively, try, to, avoid, the, player‐character, (see, Capturing)., Nor, should, the, term, be, used, for, games, that, require, the, use, of, objects, (such, as, keys,, currency,, or, weaponry), which, are, only, indirectly, used, in, the, attainment, of, the, game’s, objective., Some, games, involve, the, collecting, of, pieces, of, an, object, which, can, be, assembled, once, all, the, pieces, are, found,, such, as, the, bridge, in, Superman, or, the, urn, in, Haunted, House,, although, these, games, often, have, objectives, that, involve, more, than, simply, collecting,, and, so, should, not, be, considered, as, belonging, to, this, genre., Examples:, Amidar, (with, Abstract);, Mousetrap, (with, Maze, and, Escape);, Pac‐man, (with, Maze, and, Escape);, Spy, Vs, Spy, (with, Combat, and, Maze);, Prop, Cycle, (with, Flying);, Qix, (with, Abstract), Combat, Games, which, involve, two, or, more, players,, or, one, player, and, a, computer‐controlled, player,, shooting, some, form, of, projectiles, at, each, other,, and, in, which, all, players, are, provided, with, similar, means, for, a, fairly, balanced, fight., These, games, usually, emphasize, maneuverability, and, sometimes, the, outwitting, of, the, opponent., This, term, should, not, be, used, for, Shoot, ’Em, Up, games, in, which, the, two, sides, are, clearly, unequal, or, not, evenly, balanced,, nor, for, Fighting, games, which, do, not, involve, shooting., Although, these, games, may, range, in, the, appearance, of, their, content,, for, example,, cowboys, in, Outlaw,, tanks, or, planes, in, Combat,, or, paddles, in, Warlords,, the, basic, play, of, the, game,, shoot, the, opponent, while, avoiding, getting, shot,, remains, essentially, the, same., Note:, For, related, games,, see, Fighting, and, Shoot, ’Em, Up., Examples:, Battletech;, Battlezone;, Combat;, Dactyl, Nightmare;, Outlaw;, Spy, Vs, Spy, (with, Collecting, and, Maze);, Warlords, Demo, Cartridges,, discs,, or, downloads, designed, to, demonstrate, games, or, a, game, system., Such, cartridges, were, primarily, used, in, store, displays, to, demonstrate, games., While, they, may, not, contain, complete, games, themselves,, these, cartridges, have, the, same, appearance, as, game, cartridges, and, are, sometimes, collected, and, traded, as, game, cartridges,, and, they, are, often, included, in, listings, of, cartridges., As, discs, or, downloads,, Demos, allow, a, player, to, try, out, a, game, for, free, without, buying, the, full‐sized, game., Note:, Not, necessary, to, cross‐list, with, Utility,, as, that, is, implied, in, Demo., Examples:, ADAM, Demo, Cartridge,, Dealer, Demo, (Bally, Astrocade),, Demonstration, Cartridge, (RCA, Studio, II),, Music, Box, Demo, (Coleco, ADAM), Diagnostic, Cartridges, designed, to, test, the, functioning, of, a, system., While, they, are, not, games, themselves,, these, cartridges, have, the, same, appearance, as, game, cartridges, and, are, sometimes, collected, and, traded, as, game, cartridges,, and, they, are, often, included, in, listings, of, cartridges., Note:, Not, necessary, to, cross‐list, with, Utility,, as, that, is, implied, in, Diagnostic., Examples:, Diagnostic, Cartridge, (Identification, number, FDS100144), for, the, Atari, 5200, system;, Diagnostic, Cartridge, (Identification, number, CB101196), for, the, Atari, 7800, system,, Final, Test, Cartridge, (Coleco, ADAM),, Super, Controller, Test, Cartridge, (Coleco, ADAM), Dodging, Games, in, which, the, primary, objective, is, to, avoid, projectiles, or, other, moving, objects., Scoring, is, often, determined, by, the, number, of, objects, successfully, dodged,, or, by, the, crossing, of, a, field, of, moving, objects, that, must, be, dodged, (as, in, Freeway, or, Frogger)., This, term, should, not, be, used, for, games, in, which, players, avoid, getting, shot, at, and, are, able, to, shoot, (see, Combat, and, Shoot, ’Em, Up)., In, many, games, like, Asteroids, or, Space, Invaders, avoidance, of, objects, or, projectiles, is, important, for, the, player, to, remain, in, the, game,, but, points, are, not, awarded, for, merely, avoiding, them,, and, players, usually, have, the, option, of, shooting, at, obstacles,, which, is, not, the, case, in, Dodging, games., Examples:, Dodge, ’Em, (with, Driving),, Freeway, (with, Obstacle, Course);, Frogger, (with, Obstacle, Course);, Journey, Escape;, and, some, games, in, Street, Racer, (with, Driving, and, Racing), Driving, Games, based, primarily, on, driving, skills,, such, as, steering,, maneuverability,, speed, control,, and, fuel, conservation., This, term, should, not, be, used, for, games, in, which, racing, or, the, winning, of, a, race, is, the, main, objective, (see, Racing),, nor, for, games, which, are, essentially, obstacle, courses, in, which, a, player’s, main, objective, is, to, hit, or, avoid, touching, a, series, of, objects, or, characters, (see, Obstacle, Course),, unless, driving, skills, are, essential, to, play, and, to, the, winning, of, the, game., In, most, cases,, Driving, games, involve, vehicles,, whereas, Obstacle, Course, games, generally, do, not., Scoring, in, Driving, games, is, often, based, on, how, fast, a, particular, course, is, completed,, rather, than, whether, or, not, an, opponent, is, beat, in, a, race,, and, these, games, are, often, single‐player, games., Examples:, Dodge, ’Em, (with, Dodging);, Indy, 500, (with, Racing);, Night, Driver;, Pole, Position, (with, Racing);, Red, Planet, (with, Racing);, Street, Racer, (with, Dodging, and, Racing), Educational, Games, which, are, designed, to, teach,, and, in, which, the, main, objective, involves, the, learning, of, a, lesson., Rather, than, being, structured, as, a, straightforward, set, of, lessons, or, exercises,, these, programs, are, structured, like, games,, with, such, elements, as, scoring,, timed, performances,, or, incentives, given, for, correct, answers., The, degree, to, which, these, programs, can, be, considered, games, varies, greatly., Note:, Not, necessary, to, cross‐list, with, Utility,, as, this, is, implied, in, Educational., Examples:, Alpha, Beam, with, Ernie, (with, Catching);, Basic, Math;, Mario’s, Early, Years:, Fun, With, Numbers;, Mario, Teaches, Typing;, Math, Blaster:, Episode, 1;, Math, Grand, Prix;, Morse;, Number, Games;, Playschool, Math;, Spelling, Games;, Word, Games, Escape, Games, whose, main, objective, involves, escaping, pursuers, or, getting, out, of, some, form, of, enclosure., Games, can, be, open‐ended,, with, the, game, ending, when, a, player, escapes, from, an, enclosure, or, enters, a, place, safe, from, the, pursuers,, or, closed,, in, which, a, player, escapes, pursuers, for, as, long, as, possible, but, always, succumbs, in, the, end, (as, in, Pac‐Man)., This, term, should, not, be, used, for, games, in, which, the, player‐character, battles, the, opponent, instead, of, fleeing, (see, Combat, and, Shoot, ’Em, Up),, nor, for, games, like, Adventure, or, Haunted, House, in, which, the, player‐character, is, only, occasionally, pursued, by, characters., Examples:, Pac‐Man, (with, Collecting, and, Maze);, Maze, Craze, (with, Maze);, Mousetrap, (with, Collecting, and, Maze);, Ms., Pac‐Man, (with, Collecting, and, Maze);, Surround, (with, Capturing), Fighting, Games, involving, characters, who, fight, usually, hand‐to‐hand,, in, one‐to‐one, combat, situations, without, the, use, of, firearms, or, projectiles., In, most, of, these, games,, the, fighters, are, represented, as, humans, or, anthropomorphic, characters., This, term, should, not, be, used, for, games, which, involve, shooting, or, vehicles, (see, Combat, and, Shoot, ’Em, Up),, or, for, games, which, include, fighting,, like, Ice, Hockey,, but, which, have, other, objectives, (see, Sports)., Note:, Many, Fighting, games, can, also, be, cross‐listed, with, Sports., For, related, games,, see, also, Combat., Examples:, Avengers;, Body, Slam;, Boxing, (with, Sports);, games, in, the, Mortal, Kombat, series;, Soul, Edge;, games, in, the, Tekken, series;, Wrestle, War, Flying, Games, involving, flying, skills,, such, as, steering,, altitude, control,, takeoff, and, landing,, maneuverability,, speed, control,, and, fuel, conservation., This, term, should, not, be, used, for, games, in, which, shooting, an, opponent, is, the, main, objective, (see, Combat, and, Shoot, ’Em, Up),, unless, flying, skills, are, essential, to, game, play, and, to, the, winning, of, the, game., Flying, games, can, involve, airplanes,, birds,, or, spaceships,, and, movement, can, take, place, in, the, sky, (as, in, A‐10, Attack, and, Prop, Cycle),, through, caverns, (as, in, Descent),, or, in, outer, space, (as, in, Starmaster, and, Star, Ship)., Note:, See, also, Combat,, Shoot, ’Em, Up,, Sports,, and, Training, Simulation., Examples:, A‐10, Attack, (with, Training, Simulation);, Descent, (with, Maze, and, Shoot, ’Em, Up);, F/A‐18, Hornet, 3.0, (with, Training, Simulation);, Flight, Unlimited, (with, Training, Simulation);Prop, Cycle, (with, Collecting);, Solaris;, Starmaster, (with, Shoot, ’Em, Up), Gambling, Games, which, involve, the, betting, of, a, stake,, which, increases, or, decreases, the, player’s, total, assets, in, the, following, round., These, games, usually, involve, multiple, rounds, of, betting,, allowing, a, player’s, stakes, or, money, to, grow, or, diminish, over, time., This, term, should, not, be, used, for, games, in, which, betting, does, not, occur,, or, for, games, in, which, wins, and, losses, do, not, carry, over, into, the, following, round., Note:, See, also, Card, Games, and, Table‐Top, Games., Examples:, Blackjack, (with, Card, Games);, Casino, (with, Card, Games);, Slot, Machine;, Video, Poker, (with, Card, Games);, You, Don’t, Know, Jack, (with, Quiz), Interactive, Movie, Games, which, are, made, up, of, branching, video, clips, or, other, moving, images,, the, branching, of, which, is, decided, by, a, player’s, actions., Players, are, often, called, to, make, decisions, at, points, in, the, game, where, the, action, stalls, or, loops,, or, during, action, sequences, that, allow, player, input, which, can, stop, or, change, the, course, of, action, while, the, video, clip, is, running., While, the, player, may, be, given, limited, freedom, of, movement, or, action,, revelation, of, the, story, is, still, largely, linear, in, structure,, with, little, or, no, variation, possible, in, its, overall, sequence, of, events., This, term, should, not, be, used, for, games, which, place, a, controllable, player‐character, over, backgrounds, which, are, video, clips,, like, Rebel, Assault,, nor, should, the, term, be, used, to, refer, to, games, like, Myst, which, allow, a, player, to, wander, and, explore, its, world, freely,, but, still, limit, outcomes, and, possible, narrative, paths, to, a, series, of, video, sequences, and, linear, progression, through, a, relatively, predetermined, narrative., Examples:, Dragon’s, Lair;, Space, Ace;, Gadget;, Johnny, Mnemonic;, Star, Trek, Borg, Management, Simulation, Games, in, which, players, must, balance, the, use, of, limited, resources, to, build, or, expand, some, kind, of, community,, institution,, or, empire,, while, dealing, with, internal, forces, within, (such, as, the, crime, and, pollution, in, SimCity),, or, external, forces, such, as, those, of, nature, or, chance, (such, as, natural, disasters, and, monsters, in, SimCity,, or, planets, that, require, various, amounts, of, terraforming, as, in, Spaceward, Ho!),, and, often, competition, from, other, players, as, well., Single‐player, games, are, often, open‐ended,, where, the, community, or, institution, grows, and, developed, over, time, and, continues, changing,, while, multiple‐player, games, usually, have, the, objective, of, dominating, all, of, the, other, players,, at, which, point, the, game, ends., In, some, cases,, these, games, can, take, on, an, educational, functional, as, well,, for, example,, games, found, in, museum, displays, which, simulate, supply, and, demand, or, other, economic, principles., Note:, See, also, Educational, and, Utility., Examples:, Aerobiz;, Caesar, II;, Sid, Meier’s, Civilization;, M.U.L.E.;, Monopoly;, Railroad, Tycoon;, SimAnt;, SimCity;, SimFarm;, SimTower;, Spaceward, Ho!, Maze, Games, in, which, the, objective, requires, the, successful, navigation, of, a, maze., What, can, be, called, a, maze, is,, of, course,, a, matter, of, degree,, though, it, is, usually, possible, to, discern, whether, a, configuration, of, rooms, or, hallways, was, intended, to, deliberately, cause, difficulties, in, navigation, (consider,, for, example,, the, difference, in, complexity, between, the, mazes, found, in, Berzerk,, Pac‐Man,, and, Doom)., Mazes, may, appear, in, an, overhead, view, (as, in, Pac‐Man),, a, side, view, (as, in, Lode, Runner),, or, first‐person, perspective, (as, in, Doom), or, hidden, from, view, (as, in, certain, games, in, Maze, Craze)., In, some, cases,, the, player‐character, can, alter, the, maze,, such, as, opening, or, closing, passageways, (as, in, Mousetrap),, or, even, digging, holes, or, passageways, (as, in, Lode, Runner, or, Dig, Dug)., Some, mazes,, such, as, those, found, in, Lode, Runner,, focus, less, on, navigation, and, more, on, how, to, gain, access, to, certain, portions, of, the, screen, in, order, to, achieve, certain, results, or, obtain, objects., Often, the, player‐character, must, navigate, the, maze, under, the, pressure, of, pursuers,, although, this, is, not, always, the, case., Mazes, are, also, often, imbedded, within, other, games,, such, as, the, Blue, Labyrinth, in, Adventure,, or, the, underground, maze, of, the, Selenetic, Age, in, Myst., Examples:, Descent, (with, Flying, and, Shoot, ’Em, Up);, Dig, Dug;, Doom, (with, Shoot, ’Em, Up);, K., C., Munchkin, (with, Collecting, and, Escape);, Lode, Runner, (with, Platform);, Maze, Craze;, Mousetrap, (with, Collecting, and, Escape);, Pac‐man, (with, Collecting, and, Escape);, Tunnel, Runner;, Tunnels, of, Doom, (with, Adventure);, Ms., Pac‐Man, (with, Collecting, and, Escape);, Spy, Vs, Spy, (with, Collecting, and, Combat);, Take, the, Money, and, Run, Obstacle, Course, Games, in, which, the, main, objective, involves, the, traversing, of, a, difficult, path, or, one, beset, with, obstacles,, through, which, movement, is, essentially, linear,, often, involving, running,, jumping,, and, avoiding, dangers., This, term, should, not, be, used, for, games, which, do, not, require, more, than, simply, steering, down, a, clear, path, (see, Driving), or, avoiding, objects, or, characters, without, a, linear, progression, of, movement, (see, Dodging),, nor, should, it, be, used, for, games, which, involve, chasing, or, being, chased, (see, Chase),, or, shooting, at, opponents, or, getting, shot, at, (see, Combat, and, Shoot, ’Em, Up),, nor, for, games, with, complex, objectives, (see, Adventure),, nor, for, games, involving, more, than, traversing, a, path, of, obstacles, (see, Platform)., Note:, While, Obstacle, Courses, are, generally, linear, in, design, as, far, as, the, player‐character’s, advancement, through, them, is, concerned,, this, degree, of, linearity, can, vary, somewhat;, for, example,, in, games, allowing, a, character, to, backtrack,, or, choose, an, alternate, route., Examples:, Boot, Camp;, Clown, Downtown;, Freeway, (with, Dodging);, Frogger, (with, Dodging);, Pitfall!;, Jungle, Hunt, Pencil‐and‐Paper, Games, Games, which, are, adaptations, of, games, usually, played, by, means, of, pencil, and, paper, (see, Adaptation)., This, term, should, not, be, used, for, drawing, or, doodling, programs, (see, Utility),, or, for, games, like, those, in, the, Dungeons, &, Dragons, series,, whose, adaptations, are, very, different, from, the, version, of, the, game, played, with, pencil, and, paper., Note:, Not, necessary, to, use, with, Adaptation, as, this, is, implied, in, Pencil‐and‐Paper, Games., Examples:, 3‐D, Tic‐Tac‐Toe;, Effacer:, Hangman, from, the, 25th, Century;, Noughts, and, Crosses;, Tic‐Tac‐Toe;, and, Hangman, which, appears, as, a, cartridge, in, several, game, systems., Pinball, Games, which, simulate, the, play, of, a, pinball, game., Although, these, games, could, be, considered, as, Table‐Top, Games,, there, is, a, tradition, of, video, pinball, games, and, a, wide, variety, of, them, to, warrant, categorizing, them, in, a, genre, of, their, own., Note:, Not, necessary, to, cross‐list, with, Table‐Top, Games, as, that, is, implied, in, Pinball., Examples:, Arcade, Pinball;, Astrocade, Pinball;, Electronic, Pinball;, Extreme, Pinball;, Flipper, Game;, Galactic, Pinball;, Kirby’s, Pinball, Land;, Midnight, Magic;, Pachinko!;, Pinball;, Pinball, Challenge;, Pinball, Dreams;, Pinball, Fantasies;, Pinball, Jam;, Pinball, Quest;, Pinball, Wizard;, Power, Rangers, Pinball;, Pro, Pinball;, Real, Pinball;, Sonic, Spinball;, Spinball;, Super, Pinball:, Behind, the, Mask;, Super, Sushi, Pinball;, Thunderball!;, True, Pinball;, Video, Pinball, Platform, Games, in, which, the, primary, objective, requires, movement, through, a, series, of, levels,, by, way, of, running,, climbing,, jumping,, and, other, means, of, locomotion., Characters, and, settings, are, seen, in, side, view, as, opposed, to, top, view,, thus, creating, a, graphical, sense, of, up, and, down, as, is, implied, in, Platform., These, games, often, also, can, involve, the, avoidance, of, dropped, or, falling, objects,, conflict, with, (or, navigation, around), computer‐controlled, characters,, and, often, some, character,, object,, or, reward, at, the, top, of, the, climb, which, provides, narrative, motivation., This, term, should, not, be, used, for, games, which, do, not, involve, ascending, heights, or, advancement, through, a, series, of, levels, (see, Adventure),, nor, for, games, which, involve, little, more, than, traversing, a, path, of, obstacles, (see, Obstacle, Course)., Note:, For, related, games,, see, also, Adventure, and, Obstacle, Course., Examples:, Crazy, Climber;, Donkey, Kong;, Donkey, Kong, Jr.;, Lode, Runner, (with, Maze);, Spiderman, (Atari, 2600);, Super, Mario, Bros., (with, Collecting);, Warioland;, Yoshi’s, Island, Programming, Games, Games, in, which, the, player, write, short, programs, that, control, agents, within, a, game., These, agents, then, compete, and, react, to, situations, based, on, the, player’s, programming., This, term, should, not, be, used, for, games, which, a, player, must, learn, to, operate, a, machine,, such, as, in, Riven, (see, Puzzle),, nor, for, games, in, which, the, player, controls, the, player‐characters, directly., Depending, on, what, the, programmed, agents, do,, games, may, be, able, to, be, cross‐listed, with, other, genres., Examples:, AI, Fleet, Commander;, AI, Wars,, CoreWar;, CRobots;, Omega;, RARS, (Robot, Auto, Racing, Simulator);, Robot, Battle, Puzzle, Games, in, which, the, primary, conflict, is, not, so, much, between, the, player‐character, and, other, characters,, but, rather, the, figuring, out, of, a, solution,, which, often, involves, solving, enigmas,, navigation,, learning, how, to, use, different, tools,, and, the, manipulating, or, reconfiguring, of, objects., Most, often, there, is, a, visual, or, sonic, element, to, the, puzzles, as, well,, or, at, least, some, verbal, description, of, them., This, term, should, not, be, used, for, games, which, only, involve, the, answering, of, questions, (see, Quiz)., Many, Text, Adventures, also, contain, Puzzles,, and, use, text, to, describe, their, sights, and, sounds, Examples:, 7th, Guest;, Atari, Video, Cube;, Block, Out, (with, Abstract);, Dice, Puzzle;, Hitchhiker’s, Guide, to, the, Galaxy, (with, Text, Adventure);, Jigsaw;, Myst, (with, Adventure);, Rubik’s, Cube, (with, Adaptation);, Sokoban;, Suspended, Animation, (with, Text, Adventure);, Tetris, (with, Abstract), Quiz, Games, which, in, which, the, main, objective, is, the, successful, answering, of, questions., Scoring, is, usually, based, on, either, how, many, questions, are, answered, correctly,, or, on, the, amount, of, money, players, have, after, betting, on, their, answers., Some, of, these, games, are, adaptations, of, board, games, or, quiz, shows, from, television., Note:, Games, in, which, the, player, can, place, a, bet, on, their, answers, should, be, cross‐listed, with, Gambling., Examples:, $25,000, Pyramid, (with, Adaptation);, Fax;, Jeopardy, (with, Adaptation);, NFL, Football, Trivia, Challenge, ’94/’95;, Name, That, Tune, (with, Adaptation);, You, Don’t, Know, Jack, (with, Gambling);, Sex, Trivia;, Trivial, Pursuit, (with, Adaptation);, Trivia, Whiz;, Triv‐Quiz;, Video, Trivia;, Wizz, Quiz, Racing, Games, in, which, the, objective, involves, the, winning, of, a, race,, or, the, covering, of, more, ground, than, an, opponent, (as, in, Slot, Racers)., Often, these, games, involve, driving, skills, and, can, also, be, cross‐listed, with, Driving., One‐player, games, can, be, considered, Racing, if, there, are, other, computer‐controlled, cars, or, vehicles, competing, on, the, race, track,, however, if, they, are, not, competitive, and, act, only, as, obstacles,, use, Driving., Note:, See, also, Driving., Not, necessary, to, cross‐list, with, Sports, as, this, is, implied, in, Racing., Although, most, of, these, games, involve, driving, skills, and, can, be, cross‐listed, with, Driving,, some, of, them,, like, 1000, Miles,, do, not., Examples:, 1000, Miles, (with, Card, Games);, Daytona, U.S.A., (with, Driving);, High, Velocity, (with, Driving);, Indy, 500, (with, Driving);, Mario, Kart, 64, (with, Driving);, Math, Grand, Prix, (with, Educational);, Pole, Position, (with, Driving);, Red, Planet, (with, Driving);, Slot, Racers, (with, Dodging);, Street, Racer, (with, Dodging, and, Driving);, Super, GT, (with, Driving), Rhythm, and, Dance, Games, in, which, gameplay, requires, players, to, keep, time, with, a, musical, rhythm., These, games, may, employ, a, variety, of, controllers, beyond, the, usual, video, game, hardware,, including, controllers, simulating, drums, (as, in, DrumMania),, turntables, (as, in, Beatmania),, guitars, (as, in, Guitar, Freaks),, or, even, maracas, (as, in, Samba, de, Amigo)., Examples:, Beatmania;, Bust‐a‐Groove;, Dance, Dance, Revolution;, Guitar, Freaks;, PaRappa, the, Rapper;, Pop, ’n’, Music;, Samba, de, Amigo;, Space, Channel, 5;, Um, Jammer, Lammy;, Vib‐Ribbon, (with, Obstacle, Course), Role‐Playing, Games, in, which, players, create, or, take, on, a, character, represented, by, various, statistics,, which, may, even, include, a, developed, persona., The, character’s, description, may, include, specifics, such, as, species,, race,, gender,, and, occupation,, and, may, also, include, various, abilities,, such, as, strength, and, dexterity,, to, limited, degrees, usually, represented, numerically., The, games, can, be, single‐player,, such, as, Ultima, III:, Exodus, (1983),, or, multiple‐player, games, such, as, those, which, are, networked., This, term, should, not, be, used, for, games, like, Adventure, or, Raiders, of, the, Lost, Ark, in, which, identity, is, not, emphasized, or, important,, nor, where, characters, are, not, represented, statistically., Note:, Many, networked, games,, including, MUDs, (Multi‐User, Dimensions),, MOOs, (MUD,, Object‐Oriented),, and, MUSHs, (Multi‐User, Shared, Hallucination),, fall, into, this, category,, although, the, degree, to, which, they, can, be, considered, games, may, vary, depending, on, the, players, and, system, operators,, and, whether, or, not, objectives, are, set, for, the, players, and, competition, occurs., Examples:, Anvil, of, Dawn;, Diablo;, Dragon, Lore, 2;, Fallout;, Mageslayer;, Phantasy, Star;, Sacred, Pools;, Games, from, the, Ultima, series, or, Dungeons, &, Dragons, series., Networked, games, include:, Interstate, ’76;, Ivory, Tower;, JediMUD;, Northern, Lights;, OutlawMOO;, PernMUSH;, RiftMUSH;, Rivers, of, MUD;, Sunflower;, Unsafe, Haven;, VikingMUD;, Zodiac., Shoot, ’Em, Up, (or, Shooter), Games, involving, shooting, at,, and, often, destroying,, a, series, of, opponents, or, objects., As, opposed, to, Combat, games, which, feature, one‐on‐one, battles, with, opponents, of, roughly, equal, attributes, and, means,, Shoot, ’Em, Up, games, usually, feature, multiple, opponents, (the, ’Em, is, short, for, them), attacking, at, once, (as, in, Space, Invaders, or, Galaga), or, multiple, objects, which, can, be, destroyed, (as, in, Centipede),, which, are, often, potentially, harmful, to, the, player‐character, (as, in, Asteroids)., In, many, cases,, the, player‐character, and, opponents, of, the, player‐character, have, unequal, attributes, and, means,, and, do, not, even, resemble, one, another, (as, in, Yar’s, Revenge),, and, the, games, usually, require, quick, reflexes., Do, not, use, this, term, for, games, like, Stellar, Track,, in, which, the, player‐character, and, opponents, fire, at, each, other,, but, in, such, a, way, that, quick, reflexes, are, not, necessary, (see, Strategy)., There, are, three, types, of, Shoot, ’Em, Up, games, which, are, common:, in, one,, the, player‐character, moves, horizontally, back, and, forth, at, the, bottom, of, the, screen, shooting, upward, while, opponents, moving, around, above, shoot, downward, (as, in, Space, Invaders);, in, the, second,, the, character, moves, freely, about, the, screen,, encountering, opponents, from, all, sides, (as, in, Berserk, or, Robotron:, 2084),, and, the, third, features, a, first‐person, perspective, (as, in, Doom)., This, term, should, not, be, used, for, fighting, games, which, do, not, involve, shooting, (see, Fighting),, nor, for, games, in, which, opponents, are, fairly, evenly, matched, (see, Combat),, nor, for, games, in, which, none, of, the, objects, the, player‐character, fires, upon, can, harm, the, player‐character, (see, Target)., In, a, few, cases,, the, player‐character, is, primarily, defending, rather, than, attacking,, as, in, Atlantis,, Commando, Raid,, Missile, Command,, and, Missile, Defense, 3‐D., Examples:, Asteroids;, Berzerk;, Centipede;, Doom;, Duckshot;, Galaga;, Millipede;, Missile, Command,, Robotron:, 2084;, Space, Invaders;, Yar’s, Revenge;, Zaxxon, Simulation, See, Management, Simulation, and, Training, Simulation, Sports, Games, which, are, adaptations, of, existing, sports, or, variations, of, them., Note:, No, need, to, cross‐list, with, Adaptation, as, this, is, implied, in, Sports., See, also, Driving,, Fighting,, Obstacle, Course,, Racing,, and, Table‐Top, Games., Examples:, American, Football;, Atari, Baseball;, Bowling;, Boxing, (with, Fighting);, Fishing, Derby, (with, Catching);, Hot, Shots, Tennis;,

emphasizing, the, use, of, strategy, as, opposed, to, fast, action, or, the, use, of, quick, reflexes,, which, are, usually, not, necessary, for, success, in, these, games., Note:, See, also, management, simulation, games, like, M.U.L.E., and, Spaceward, Ho!,, as, well, as, many, Board, Games,, Card, Games,, and, Combat, games., Examples:, Ataxx, (with, Abstract);, Checkers, (with, Board, Games),, Chess, (with, Board, Games);, Monopoly, (with, Board, Games);, M.U.L.E., (with, Management, Simulation);, Othello, (with, Board, Games);, Spaceward, Ho!, (with, Management, Simulation);, Stellar, Track, Table‐Top, Games, Games, involving, adaptations, of, existing, table‐top, games, requiring, physical, skill, or, action, (such, as, pool, or, pinball)., This, term, should, not, be, used, for, games, involving, little, or, no, physical, skill, or, action, (see, Board, Games, and, Card, Games),, nor, should, it, be, used, for, games, which, cannot, be, played, on, a, table‐top, of, some, sort, (see, Sports)., For, games, which, resemble, pinball, games,, see, Pinball., Note:, Not, necessary, to, cross‐list, with, Adaptation,, as, this, is, implied, in, Table‐Top, Games., Examples:, Battle, Ping, Pong;, Electronic, Table, Soccer!;, Parlour, Games;, Pocket, Billiards!;, Pong, (with, Sports);, Sure, Shot, Pool;, Trick, Shot;, Virtual, Pool, Target, Games, in, which, the, primary, objective, involves, aiming, and, shooting, at, targets, which, are, not, moving, or, in, motion., Occasionally, the, targets, may, be, harming, the, player‐character’s, property, (as, in, Wabbit)., This, term, should, not, be, used, for, games, in, which, the, player‐character, can, be, fired, upon, by, opponents, (see, Combat,, and, Shoot, ’Em, Up),, or, games, do, not, involve, shooting, (see, Catching, and, Collecting),, nor, for, games, in, which, the, objects, or, characters, actively, elude, the, player‐character., Examples:, Air‐Sea, Battle;, Carnival;, Human, Cannonball;, Marksman/Trapshooting;, Shooting, Gallery;, Skeet, Shoot, (with, Sports);, Wabbit, Text, Adventure, Games, which, rely, primarily, on, text, for, the, player, interface,, and, often, for, the, description, of, the, game’s, world, and, the, action, which, takes, place, there, as, well., Some, games, may, use, images,, but, these, are, usually, noninteractive, illustrations, which, are, not, central, to, the, play, of, the, game., Games, range, from, allowing, free, movement, throughout, the, game’s, world, (usually, by, commands, such, as, north,, south,, east,, west,, up,, and, down), with, a, variety, of, options, for, interaction,, to, more, linear,, branching, narratives., Players, often, are, able, to, carry, objects, which, are, kept, track, of, by, an, inventory, function,, and, are, able, to, converse, with, computer‐controlled, player‐characters, through, a, very, limited, vocabulary., Although, some, games, may, incorporate, text‐based, informational, screens, (as, in, Stellar, Track),, rely, on, text, for, description, (such, as, the, books, in, the, library, in, Myst),, or, even, use, text, as, a, graphic, element, (such, as, Rogue),, this, term, should, only, be, used, for, games, in, which, the, world, of, the, game, is, primarily, experienced, through, text, which, describes, the, world, of, the, game, and, the, events, occurring, in, it., Note:, Not, necessary, to, cross‐list, with, Adventure, since, that, is, implied, in, Text, Adventure., Multiple, player, Text, Adventures, which, are, networked, are, considered, to, be, Role‐Playing, games, (see, Role‐Playing)., Almost, all, Text, Adventures, can, also, be, cross‐listed, with, Puzzle., Examples:, The, Hitchhiker’s, Guide, to, the, Galaxy;, Planetfall;, Leather, Goddesses, of, Phobos;, Suspended;, Zork., Training, Simulation, Games, or, programs, which, attempt, to, simulate, a, realistic, situation,, for, the, purpose, of, training,, and, usually, the, development, of, some, physical, skill, such, as, steering, (as, in, driving, and, flight, simulators)., This, term, should, not, be, used, for, simulations, which, focus, on, management, (see, Management, Simulation), or, the, employment, of, strategy, (see, Strategy)., These, games, can, range, from, realistic, simulations, used, by, institutions,, such, as, those, used, to, train, astronauts,, tank, drivers,, or, airline, pilots,, to, simplified, gamelike, approximations, of, them, used, mainly, for, entertainment,, such, as, Police, Trainer, or, A‐10, Attack., Note:, Not, necessary, to, cross‐list, with, Utility, or, Simulation,, as, that, is, implied, in, Training, Simulation., Examples:, A‐10, Attack;, Comanche, 3, (with, Flying);, F/A‐18, Hornet, 3.0, (with, Flying);, Flight, Unlimited, (with, Flying);, Police, Trainer;, military, and, airline, flight, simulators;, and, driving, simulations, used, in, driver, education., Utility, Cartridges, or, programs, which, have, a, purpose, or, functional, beyond, that, of, entertainment,, although, they, may, be, structured, in, a, manner, similar, to, games, (such, as, Mario, Teaches, Typing), or, contain, elements, of, entertainment., While, they, are, often, not, games, themselves,, some, of, these, programs, have, the, same, appearance, as, game, cartridges, and, are, sometimes, collected, and, traded, as, game, cartridges,, and, they, are, usually, included, in, listings, of, cartridges., Note:, See, also, Demo,, Diagnostic,, Educational,, and, Simulation., Examples:, Basic, Programming;, Beginning, Algebra;, Beginning, Math;, Computer, Programmer;, Diagnostic, Cartridge, (Identification, number, FDS100144), for, the, Atari, 5200, system, (with, Diagnostic);, Home, Finance;,

Amongst, his, genres, he, lists, diagnostics,, demos, and, utilities., While, it, may, be, argued, that, demos, are, a, distinct, genre, as, they, are, trying, to, make, you, buy, the, full, game, (an, argument, I, do, not, buy),, I, fail, to, see, how, diagnostics, or, utilities, can, be, classified, as, genres, of, games, of, any, sort., His, rational, [sic], seems, to, be, that, they, come, in, cartridges, or, CD‐ROM’s, like, games, and, some, game, collectors, collect, them, too,, so, they, are, the, same, as, games., —Review, of, The, Medium, of, the, Video, Game, by, Bryan‐Mitchell, Young, More, recently,, Mark, J.P., Wolf, has, come, up, with, 42, different, genres, of, games, according, to, the, kind, of, interactivity, they, offer., However,, if, we, see, genre‐based, categorizations, as, a, means, of, making, sense, out, of, a, larger, whole,, 42, genres, ceases, to, be, useful., Or,, we, have, to, accept, that, the, diversity, of, games, requires, many, more, genres, and, subgenres, than, traditional, media, products, which, have, benefitted, from, genre, studies., Or,, that, a, game, genre, equals, hybridity,, because, game, genres, are, complex, sums, of, interaction, and, rule, mechanisms,, audiovisual, styles,, and, popular, fiction, genre, conventions., —Halo, and, the, Anatomy, of, the, FPS,, by, Aki, Järvinen, Mark, sent, me, this, response, to, their, criticisms:, Of, course,, any, proposed, system, of, genres, will, be, the, subject, of, debate, and, criticism., At, the, same, time,, coming, up, with, a, consistent, and, comprehensive, list, of, genres, that, attempts, to, define, and, articulate, the, boundaries, of, each, is, a, much, more, difficult, task, than, criticizing, existing, lists., As, for, Young’s, complaint, regarding, the, inclusion, of, diagnostic,, demo,, and, utility,, I, would, agree, that, these, go, somewhat, beyond, games,, but, then, so, do, some, of, the, entries, in, the, genres, education, and, simulation,, and, there, are, some, who, would, argue, that, Myst, and, Mavis, Beacon, Teaches, Typing, are, not, games,, leading, us, into, varying, definitions, of, games., In, trying, to, be, exhaustive,, I, have, been, inclusive, rather, than, exclusive,, and, such, genres, as, diagnostic,, demo,, and, utility, can, simply, be, ignored, by, those, who, wish, to, be, more, exclusive,, without, upsetting, the, rest, of, the, list, (which, should, still, be, valid, for, them)., As, for, Järvinen’s, critique,, I, agree, that, 42, genres, is, a, lot,, but, to, have, less, would, mean, lumping, more, of, them, together,, and, reducing, the, specificity, (and,, I, would, argue,, the, usefulness), of, the, categories., Järvinen, is, right, in, saying, that, video, games, are, diverse,, perhaps, even, more, so, than, other, types, of, media, products., And, I, do, believe, in, hybridity, and, games, being, entered, in, multiple, genres,, as, is, evident, in, the, essay, above, and, the, list, itself., Several, genres, could, easily, be, subdivided, into, subgenres,, which, are, themselves, even, more, fluid, and, ever‐changing, than, genres,, and, their, inclusion, would, more, than, double, the, present, length, of, the, list., Mark’s, essay, may, not, be, the, last, word, on, the, subject,, but, it, is, one, of, the, first., (Chris, Crawford’s, The, Art, of, Computer, Game, Design, (1982), includes, an, earlier, taxonomy.), Any, taxonomy, is, bound, to, become, obsolete, as, new, genres, are, invented, (for, example,, the, rhythm, and, dance, genre, was, a, late, addition, to, this, essay)., Hybrids, will, continue, to, defy, easy, categorization., But, to, discuss, matters, like, how, effective, a, game, is, as, a, member, of, each, of, its, genres,, eventually, we, should, define, our, terms,, as, Mark, has, essayed, to., Valid, XHTML, 1.1, Valid, CSS, Genre, and, the, Video, Game, is, copyright, ©, 2000, Mark, J., P., Wolf,, and, is, published,
