Spider, Food,, Lead, Generators,, and, Content, Mills, Below, are, guidelines, that, directly, relate, to, adding, specific, types, of, sites., These, guidelines, will, help, ensure, that, material, added, to, DMOZ, meets, the, directory's, goals., Sites, to, Include, DMOZ's, goal, is, two-fold:, to, create, the, most, comprehensive, and, definitive, directory, of, the, Web,, and, to, create, a, high, quality,, content, rich, resource, that, the, general, public, considers, useful, and, indispensable., In, short,, editors, should, select, quality, sites, and, lots, of, them., Consider, the, relative, value, of, a, resource, in, comparison, to, other, information, resources, available, on, your, particular, topic., Relative, value, refers, not, only, to, the, quality, of, the, site,, but, also, to, its, ability, to, contribute, important,, unique, information, on, a, topic., In, general,, DMOZ, editors, should, enter, sites, that, represent, the, following:, Original,, unique, and, valuable, informational, content, that, contributes, something, unique, to, the, category's, subject., Contrasting, points, of, view, on, major, issues., DMOZ, attempts, to, cover, the, full, breadth, and, depth, of, human, knowledge,, representing, all, topics, and, points, of, view, on, those, topics., Editors, should, consider, the, following, for, each, site:, Is, the, site's, content/information, identical, or, nearly, identical to, other, sites?, A, site, should, not, mirror, content, available, on, other, sites., Does, DMOZ, include, the, type, of, site, you, want, to, add?, The, site, should, not, be, on, the, list, of, sites, that, DMOZ, does, not, generally, include., Is, the, site, complete?, The, site, should, have, working, links, and, content, rich, subpages., Links, should, not, bring, up, 404, pages, or, subpages, with, no, content., If, a, web, site, is, still, under, construction, it, is, not, a, good, candidate, for, the, directory., Sometimes, a, site, may, have, broken, links,, poor, design,, or, other, "quality", issues,, yet, presents, information, that, is, difficult, or, impossible, to, find, elsewhere, on, the, Web., Consider, adding, the, site, to, DMOZ., Even, with, some, flaws,, if, the, content, is, rare, and, unique,, the, site, may, be, considered, very, useful., Is, the, site, current?, A, site, that, claims, to, provide, time-sensitive, information, should, be, current., If, it, is, not, current,, determine, the, site's, archival, or, research, value., In, rare, instances,, a, site, that, used, to, be, current, may, still, contain, valuable, articles,, links, and, other, resources., For, example,, an, antiques, newsletter, that, hasn't, been, updated, in, 2, years, may, still, contain, valuable, articles, and, information, on, antique, buying, and, appraisal., However,, a, site, that, claims, to, provide, daily, current, events, news, that, hasn't, been, updated, in, several, months, or, even, years,, may, no, longer, have, any, significant, value., Is, the, site, available, and, does, it, load, completely?, The, site, should, load, in, a, reasonable, time, and, be, consistently, available., Design, alone, is, rarely, a, valid, reason, to, deny, a, listing, for, an, otherwise, content, rich, site., The, only, time, design, may, be, a, factor, if, it, renders, the, site, unreadable., Is, it, easy, to, assess, the, site's, trustworthiness?, Can, you, see, which, person, or, entity, is, responsible, for, it?, Does, it, give, enough, information, about, the, source, for, a, user, to, judge, its, reliability?, While, we, cannot, assess, the, accuracy, of, every, site, we, list,, we, can, select, sites, which, give, verifiable, information., For, example,, the, site, of, a, trustworthy, business, or, organization, typically, displays, its, official, name, and, address,, or, includes, industry-appropriate, information, about, itself, verifiable, through, a, recognized, third, party., A, trustworthy, informational, site, typically, gives, its, authorship, and/or, sources,, as, appropriate,, and, makes, clear, any, commercial, sponsorship., The, information, necessary, to, verify, a, site's, trustworthiness, will, vary, depending, upon, the, topic, and, the, category., Remember,, no, site, is, guaranteed, a, listing, in, DMOZ,, and, we, depend, on, editors, to, use, their, own, discretion., In, short,, we, ask, that, editors, maintain, editorial, integrity,, keep, DMOZ's, broader, goals, and, mission, in, mind,, and, always, employ, good, common, sense., Sites, Generally, Not, Included, Since, DMOZ, attempts, to, be, comprehensive, and, all, inclusive, in, scope,, it, is, sometimes, easier, to, talk, about, the, sites, we, don't, include, rather, than, the, sites, we, do, include., This, section, provides, the, types, of, sites, the, directory, does, not, include., Affiliate, Marketing, Schemes, What, Does, "Affiliate, Marketing", Mean?, Revenue, sharing, between, online, advertisers/merchants, and, online, publishers/salespeople,, whereby, compensation, is, based, on, performance, measures,, typically, in, the, form, of, sales, of, products, and, services,, clicks,, registrations,, or, some, other, hybrid, model., There, are, four, basic, types, of, affiliate, sites:, Affiliate, Links,, Sites, Consisting, Mostly, of, Affiliate, Links,, Affiliate, Reseller, Sites, - Dropshippers, and, Multi-Level, Marketing, (MLM), Independent, Representative, sites., Why, Doesn't, DMOZ, List, These, Sites?, It's, not, the, business, model, we, don't, like., It's, the, mirrored, and, duplicated, content., For, example,, suppose, you, have, a, company, offering, data, storage, products, and, services., They, have, exclusive, resellers, who, provide, a, front, for, selling, their, products, and, services., While, the, reseller, sites, may, be, designed, and, written, differently,, their, content, and, aim, are, exactly, the, same., Adding, sites, with, the, same, content, or, that, point, to, the, same, place, are, not, unique, or, useful., Guidelines, for, Specific, Types, of, Affiliate, Site, Affiliate, Links, This, is, an, affiliate, relationship, based, on, clicks., Affiliate, links, are, URLs, for, a, commercial, site, that, usually,, but, not, always,, include, an, affiliate, or, referral, ID, in, the, URL,, such, as, AffiliateID=19555&ProductID=508., The, person, whose, ID, is, in, the, link, gets, a, commission, from, anyone, who, buys, from, the, site, after, following, that, link., Affiliate, links, should, never, be, added, to, the, directory., Sites, Consisting, Primarily, of, Affiliate, Links, Sites, or, blogs consisting, primarily, of, affiliate, links,, or, whose primary, purpose, is, to, drive, user, traffic, to, another, site, for, the, purpose, of, commission, sales,, provide, no, unique, content, and, are, not, appropriate, for, inclusion, in, the, directory., However,, a, site, that, contains, affiliate, links, in, addition, to, extensive,, original other, content, (such, as, a, fan, site, for, a, singer, that, has, interviews, and, photos, plus, banner, ads, and, links, to, buy, the, singer's, CDs), might, be, an, acceptable, submission, to, the, directory., General, rule, of, thumb:, Look, at, the, content, on, the, site,, mentally, blocking, out, all, affiliate, links., If, the, remaining, information, is, original, and, valuable, informational, content, that, contributes, something, unique, to, the, category's, subject,, the, site, may, be, a, good, candidate, for, DMOZ., If, the, remaining, content, is, poor,, minimal,, or, copied, from, some, other, site,, then, the, site, is, not, a, good, candidate, for, DMOZ.,  , Affiliate, Reseller, Sites and, Dropshippers, Affiliate, Reseller, Sites have, the, same, basic, content,, but, usually, different, designs. They, are, harder, to, spot, because, the, sites, are, designed, and, written, to, appear, different,, but, a, careful, examination, will, reveal, they, offer, the, exact, same, product, or, service, as, another, affiliated, company., The, are, usually, set, up, by, merchants, as, affiliate,, reseller,, or, lead, generator, sites., For, example,, sites, which, sell, products, or, services, provided, by, another, company, and, make, a, small, margin, on, the, sale, are, affiliate, mirrors., Dropshippers, are, very, similar., A, company, lets, others, sell, the, company's, product, through, a, website,, but, the, website, owner, does, not, stock, the, product,, the, company, does., The, website, owner, does, not, handle, sales, and, shipping,, the, company, does., All, the, website, owner, provides, is, the, website, and, order, form.  In, general, we, do, not, list, affiliate, or, dropshipper, sites, unless, the, affiliate, has, very strong,, high, quality, content, of, its, own, that, end-users, will, find, really, useful., Multi-Level, Marketing, (MLM), and, Pyramid, Schemes, Multi-level, Marketing, (MLM), is, a, system, of, selling, in, which, sales, people, may, receive, compensation, in, two, ways;, from, sales, of, goods, and, services, to, consumers, and, from, the, sales, made, by, other, sales, people, recruited, into, the, plan., You, may, list, the, domain, for, the, corporate, site,, however,, you, should, not, list, independent, representatives, or, distributor, sites., For, example,, only, the, main, corporate, MLM-Example, Company, site, should, be, listed, in, the, category, Business:, Opportunities:, Networking-MLM., MLM-Example, Company, representative, sites, should, not, be, listed, anywhere, in, the, directory., You, may, come, across, a, personal, page, that, includes, information, on, one's, activity, in, an, MLM, program., If, the, thrust, of, the, site, is, not, to, peddle, products, from, an, MLM, program,, then, the, site, might, be, a, candidate, to, list., If, you, discover, an, independent, representative, site, listed, in, the, directory, or, you, find, them, in, your, category's, unreviewed, queue,, send, them, to, the, appropriate, category, under:, Test:, Affiliates, and, Spam:, Networking-MLM, (e.g., Metabolife, rep, sites, should, be, sent, to, Test:, Affiliates, and, Spam:, Networking-MLM:, M:, Metabolife:, Independent, Representatives, )., Sites, for, "pyramid, schemes,", "chain, letters,", "make, money, fast", or, "money, games", should, not, be, listed, as, they, may, violate, the, U.S., Postal, Lottery, Statute, (18, U.S.C., §, 1302)., The, World, Federation, of, Direct, Selling, Associations, defines, a, pyramid, scheme, as, being, a, "scheme, in, which, a, recruit, pays, (an, entry, fee), for, the, opportunity, to, receive, future, benefits, (money, or, privileges), which, are, primarily, derived, from, that, recruit's, (and/or, subsequent, recruits'), introduction, of, additional, participants, in, the, scheme,, rather, than, from, the, sale, of, products, to, consumer.", Please, see, the, WFDSA, site, for, more, details., Identical, Mirrors, Identical, mirrors, are, sites, with, the, same, content, but, accessible, by, two, different, URLs., For, example,, https://en-gb.facebook.com/, is, a, mirror, of, https://www.facebook.com/, ., You, would, list, https://www.facebook.com/, ,, but, not, any, others., Sometimes, identical, mirrors, are, created, to, ease, the, load, on, the, main, site., Try, to, determine, which, of, the, mirrors, appears, to, be, the, original, site,, and, list, that, one,, if, it, is, not, already, listed., Then, remove, the, remaining, mirrors., Determination, of, the, original, site, is, not, always, obvious., Sometimes, the, URL, is, listed, on, the, site, itself,, sometimes, it, is, evident, from, the, URL., In, some, cases,, the, original, site, will, automatically, redirect, to, a, mirror, (this, occurs, to, ease, server, load,, as, mentioned, above)., Please, review, Spotting, Mirrors,, Affiliates,, and, Similar, Sites, --, this, is, 'must, read', for, all, editors,, particularly, those, editing, in, categories, containing, primarily, commercial, sites., It, provides, important, tips, for, spotting, and, dealing, with, mirrors, and, affiliates., Fraternal, Websites, Fraternal, websites, occur, when, a, company, or, other, entity, splits, its, content, into, multiple, sites., In, some, circumstances,, fraternal, websites, may, be, listable., In, most, cases, fraternal, websites are, not, listable., The, sites, for, divisions, of, large, corporations, are, usually, listable., However,, if, a, widget, company, sells, various, colored, widgets,, the, domains, for, each, color, are, not, listable., Some, examples:,  localwidget.us, (parent, url) is, listable., localbluewidget.us,, red.localwidget.us,, etc,., from, the, same, company, are, usually, not, listable., bubbasinternetservices.pt, (parent, url) is, listable., bubbaswebdesign.es,, bubbasseo.de,, bubbaswebhosting.ca,, bubbasgraphicdesign.blogpress.biz,, youface.info/bubbasinternetservices,,  etc. from, the, same, company, are, usually, not, listable., If, you, are, not, sure, whether, a, fraternal, website, is, listable, or, not,, please, get, advice, from, other, editors., Redirects, and, "Cloaked", URLs, A, redirect, URL, points, to, a, page, that, will, redirect, your, browser, to, a, completely, different, URL., An, automatic, redirect, will, immediately, redirect, your, browser, if, you, click, on, the, URL,, or, type, the, URL, in, your, browser's, address, bar., Sometimes, you, may, come, across, a, redirect, page., Redirect, pages, area, sometimes, set, up, when, site, is, moved, to, a, new, URL., You, should, never, add, automatic, redirects, or, redirect, page, links, to, the, directory., If, URL, cloaking, is, being, used,, the, target, page, will, be, displayed, in, a, full, size, frame,, so, that, the, redirect, URL, is, kept, in, the, browser's, address, bar, and, the, real, URL, of, the, displayed, page, remains, invisible., Cloaked, URLs, are, sometimes, called, "vanity, URLs", or, "framed, redirects".  Some, well, known, vanity, URLs, include:, come.to,, welcome.to,, go.to,, surf.to,, listen.to,, fly.to,, move.to,, jump.to,, run.to,, bit.ly,,  and, tinyurl.com., Cloaked, URLs, such, as, "*.to", and, "*.at", sites, should, be, reviewed, carefully., Do, not, add, the, cloaked, URLs., Add, the, real, URL, instead., For, more, information, on, URL, Cloaking,, visit, the, forum, thread, (editors, only), discussing, why, URL, cloaking, is, bad, and, the, DDP, page, on, the, subject., Illegal, Sites, Sites, with, unlawful, content, should, not, be, listed, in, the, directory,, particularly, those, intent, and, substantially, focused, on, making, available, and, distributing, illegal, materials., Examples, of, content, that, is, illegal, in, most, jurisdictions, include, child, pornography;, material, that, infringes, on, intellectual, property, rights, such, as, warez, (pirated, or, cracked, software,, music,, movies,, games, TV, shows,, etc.) and knockoffs, (gray, market, goods, such, as, fake,, replica, or, imitation brand, name, watches,, clothing,, shoes,, handbags,, etc);, material, that, advocates,, solicits, or, abets, illegal, activity, (such, as, fraud, or, violence), in, specific, instances;, and, material, that, is, libelous., Factual, and, how-to, information, is, generally, NOT, abetting, illegal, conduct, unless, its, intent, is, to, facilitate, the, immediate, commission, of, a, crime, in, a, specific, situation., An, anti-abortion, site, listing, the, names, of, abortion, doctors, may, be, OK, ;, but, an, anti-abortion, site, listing, the, names, and, addresses, of, abortion, doctors, in, a, context, that, amounts, to, an, implicit, threat, against, them, would, not, be, listed., (e.g., showing, travel, routes, and, work, schedules,, home, phone, numbers,, names, of, children, and, spouses)., Some, nations, outside, the, US, may, seek, to, exercise, jurisdiction, over, websites, available, to, users, in, their, countries., Such, jurisdictional, claims, may, extend, to, websites, like, DMOZ, that, merely, list, and, describe, other, sites., Editors, should, therefore, comply, with, the, laws, of, their, own, jurisdictions, regarding, the, activity, of, listing, various, types, of, websites., If, the, act, of, listing, a, specific, type, of, site, in, your, jurisdiction, could, be, considered, illegal,, then, you, should, not, list, it,, and, leave, it, for, someone, else, to, review., Following, these, guidelines,, editors, should, not, use, terms, for, subcategory, names, that, would, incorrectly, suggest, a, category, contains, links, to, illegal, content, (e.g.,, "Warez", or, "Bootlegs"), or, advocacy, of, illegal, activity., Similarly,, DMOZ, descriptions, should, not, suggest, that, a, listed, site, will, help, users, commit, illegal, acts, or, obtain, illegal, content, (e.g.,, pirated, software, or, music),, as, such, descriptions, could, incorrectly, suggest, an, intent, by, an, individual, editor, or, DMOZ, to, promote, the, commission, of, such, acts, or, distribution, of, such, materials., The, evaluation, of, the, potential, illegality, of, a, given, site, is, often, difficult, and, requires, case-by-case, review,, particularly, in, cases, of, copyright, and, trademark, infringement., We, don't, expect, editors, to, be, legal, experts, or, the, Internet, police., Editors, should, consult, with, DMOZ, staff, about, all, legal, issues., The, DMOZ, staff, reserves, the, right, to, delete, or, modify, site, listings, at, their, discretion., Site, Listings, Including, Search, Results, Site, listings, should, take, the, user, to, a, specific, page., It, is, bad, form, to, create, a, search, results, set, and, list, the, set, as, a, site., Entries, should, not, consist, of, search, results, from, other, web, directories,, dmoz.org,, or, generic, search, engines., In, some, rare, cases, there, may, be, listings, that, consist, of, search, results, from, specialized, content, sources,, but, this, is, not, encouraged., Under, no, circumstances, should, dmoz.org, search, results, be, listed, as, a, site, entry., Product, Listings, Sites, devoted, to, the, sales, and, distribution, of, a, single, product, should, be, avoided, if, they, are, affiliate, sites, or, if, the, site, is, merely, a, distributor, for, a, manufacturer, already, listed, in, the, Directory., The, purpose, of, DMOZ, is, not, to, replicate, the, individual, listings, of, an, online, shopping, catalog,, however, individual, product, sites, offering, substantial, information,, tips,, advice,, and, usage, information, for, consumers, are, generally, acceptable., Site, Listings, as, Notices, Site, listings, should, not, include, notes, or, messages, meant, for, editors, or, submitters, -, be, they, official, or, personal., Though, well, intentioned,, these, notices, are, compiled, into, the, DMOZ, RDF, dump,, which, is, used, by, many, different, search, companies., Notices, lose, their, meaning, and, context, with, downstream, data, users,, and, thus, only, confuse, the, searcher., Example:, CATEGORY, NOTICE, -, Please, do, not, submit, sites, to, this, category., Spider, Food,, Lead, Generators, and, Content, Mills, Spider, food, websites, and, blogs, are, intended, for, consumption, by, search, engine, software, which, spiders, the, web, to, index, pages., Their, purpose, is, to, increase, the, perceived, importance, of, another, website, by, their, links, to, it,, so, promoting, that, site, in, search, engine, rankings., Many, spider, food, websites, and, blogs, are, also, content, mills, as, described, below., Lead, generator, websites, aim, to, gather, information, from, visitors, by, means, of forms,, to, feed, the, information, to, a, business, or, businesses, represented, elsewhere, on, the, Web,, or, they, serve, as, doorway, pages, to, other, websites, where, the, "real", content, is. , Content, mill, websites, and, blogs, prominently, feature, advertising, for, other, websites, and most, of, the, informational, content, is, typically, assembled, from, other, sources., These, websites, are, not, designed, to, be, an, end, destination, themselves, but, instead, to, shuttle, visitors, to, other, websites for, the, purpose, of, affiliate, commission, sales., These, sites, and, blogs may, appear, to, be, unique,, content-rich,, informational, sites,, however, the, content, is, typically, copied, or, slightly, modified, from, reputable, sites,, or, has, been, auto-generated, or, manually, produced, but, lacks, any, real, substance., They, typically, lack, any, sort, of, authentic, and, credible, statements, of, responsibility., The, existence, of, advertising,, links, or, email, forms, is, not, by, itself, damning., These, all, appear, on, many, listable, websites., It, is, the, combination, of, such, features, and, the, absence, of, authorship, and/or, other, verifiable, information, which, characterizes, such, sites., Last, update:, Sun, Jun, 05, 19:41, EDT, 2016, Copyright, ©, 2016, AOL, Inc., (Terms, of, Use, -, License)]
