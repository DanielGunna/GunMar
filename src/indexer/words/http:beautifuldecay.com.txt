probably, spent, some, time, marveling, at, the, grandiose, installations, and, the, larger-than, life, exhibits, of, species, that, are, both, alive, and, extinct., The, Research, Library, at, the, museum, kept, incredible, records, of, how, these, things, were, produced, and, have, the, photographs, available, for, view, on, their, website., These, behind-the-scenes, looks, are, fascinating,,

all, the, technological, advances, that, we, do, today., Because, of, this,, things, in, the, museum, have, the, tendency, to, feel, dated, and, look, aged,, but, these, records, show, the, amount, of, knowledge, of, craft, and, handiwork, that, had, to, go, into, the, giant, exhibits, that, we, still, visit, today., (Via, Fish, Eyes), Read, More>, Tweet, Share, on, Tumblr, Documentary, |,

The, simple, shots, expose, an, interesting, variety, of, colorful, compositions, that, gather, an, almost, abstract, and, often, painterly, representation, of, modern, urban, planning. His,

dozens, of, celebrated, historical, monuments,, photographer, Antonio, La, Grotta, pays, tribute, to, a, different, sort, of, relic:, discotheques,, abandoned, and, decaying., In, their, repose,, there, is, an, otherworldliness, quality, about, them,, looking, as, though, they, are, the, remains, of, crash-landed, disco, spaceships., Mostly, built, in, the, 1980s,, the, buildings, are, sometimes, daring, with, the, occasional, swooping, bold, line, here, and, a, vaguely, extraterrestrial, silhouette, there., However,, the, design, borrows, more, from, chintzy, Las, Vegas, glamour., One, discotheque, —, fittingly, named, “Last, Empire”, —, is, decorated, with, reclining, Greek, statues, and, columns., Another, takes, the, form, of, a, giant, boat,, marooned, on, land, and, in, time., Some, are, a, little, more, abstract,, such, as, the, “Woodpecker,”, which, is, comprised, of, a, system, of, round, covered, pavilions, in, a, marshy, swamp., Why, photograph, these, places, now, that, the, glitz, has, turned, to, dust?, La, Grotta, said, in, an, interview,, “I, like, to, photograph, what, you, cannot, see,, the, suggestions, a, place, can, give, you,, even, if, it, doesn’t, declare, it, in, a, clear, and, open, way.”, He, describes, the, discotheques, as, “inhabited, by, echo,”, something, that, is, certainly, true, in, a, number, of, ways., The, dance, halls, are, optimistically, spacious,, and, the, occasional, pop, of, neon, color, is, a, reminder, that, this,, too,, had, its, heyday., These, discotheques, are, neither, disco, World, Heritage, Sites, nor, astounding, feats, of, engineering,, but, they, are, nevertheless, time, capsules, from, life, in, the, not-too-distant, past., Read, More>, Tweet, Share, on, Tumblr, Architecture, |,
