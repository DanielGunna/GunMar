instruction, covers, a, lot, of, ground, and, is, presented, in, a, very, logical, form, and, progression., Music, theory, is, to, be, understood, by, all, musicians., What, instrument, you, play, is, irrelevant., When, music, theory, is, used, to, play, an, instrument, it, is, called, "applied, theory"., If, you, are, a, soloist/composer, it, is, especially, vital, you, have, a, good, understanding, of, theory, so, that, you, can, apply, it, to, your, instrument/compositions., I, hope, you, enjoy, this, site, will, not, hesitate, to, refer, other, musicians, here., If, you, have, any, comments,, questions,, or, additions, to, this, material, my, email, address, is, mspark@rocketmail.com, Up, Tone/Pitch, When, I, refer, to, "tone", I, am, refering, to, a, sound, played, at, a, certain, pitch., "Pitch", is, the, frequency, of, that, tone., If, a, sound, is, high, it, has, a, high, frequency, (many, wave, peaks, per, cycle)., If, the, sound, is, low, it, has, a, lower, fequency, (fewer, wave, peaks, per, cycle)., This, frequency, is, measured, in, "Hertz", Hz., Up, The, twelve, tone, standard:, The, foundation, of, music, Sound, engineers, found, that, virtually, any, music, can, be, played, when, enough, tones, are, available., They, found, that, twelve, tones, was, that, magic, number., It, was, sufficient, enough, to, cover, all, common, types, of, music, worldwide., Therfore,, it, has, become, the, standard., The, formation, of, the, intervals, began, by, listening, to, a, reference, tone, and, its, next, higher, tone., This, tone, sounds, the, same, to, the, ear, yet, is, just, higher, in, pitch, (frequency, doubled)., Next, they, broke, the, distance, between, the, two, tones, into, equal, parts., The, distance, between, any, two, tones, is, called, an, interval., Once, the, equal, parts, were, tuned, it, was, necessary, to, experiment, with, the, pitch, of, that, reference, tone, on, which, all, the, others, tones, were, built., After, careful, listening, of, the, intervals, based, on, different, reference, pitches,, engineers, determined, that, the, pitch, that, produced, the, best, sounding, intervals, between, the, 12, tones, is, 440, hz., The, reference, tone, was, named, A., So, today, we, have, the, standard, tuning, of, A=440hz., There, are, other, pitch, tunnings, that, are, popular, yet, are, very, close, to, the, standard., Example, A=338,339,441,442hz., Any, of, the, twelve, tones, when, doubled, in, frequency, will, produce, its, next, higher, tone., Likewise, when, any, of, these, twelve, tones, frequencies, are, divided, by, 2, its, next, lower, tone, equivalant, is, produced., Example:, the, next, higher, tone, of, the, ref, tone, A, at, 440, is, 880hz,, lower, is, 220hz., The, twelve, tones, are, known, as, the, "Chromatic, Scale"., They, are, each, given, a, letter, reference, and, are, called, a, note, A,, A#,, B,, C,, C#,, D,, D#,, E,, F,, F#,, G,, G#., The, (#), symbol, means, sharp., Note:, Of, the, traditional, instruments,, the, 88, key, piano, has, the, largest, frequency, range, playing, frequencies, below, 32hz, and, above, 1,975hz!Up, Measuring, the, chromatic, scale, Today, a, simpler, measurement, exists, that, divides, each, of, the, twelve, intervals, into, one, hundred, equal, units., "Cent", meaning, one, hundred, is, that, measurement., Therefore,, the, distance, between, two, chromatic, tones, is, one, hundred, cents., All, modern, electronic, tuning, devices, today, will, show, this, measurement., Up, Scales:The, building, blocks, of, music, Scales, are, merely, a, sequence, of, notes., The, chromatic, scale, has, all, twelve, of, the, available, notes., From, the, chromatic, scale, we, can, pull, notes, out, and, create, other, scales., The, chromatic, scale, should, be, thought, of, as, our, tool, box., We, can, build, our, own, scales, from, these, twelve, notes., Earlier, we, learned, that, the, distance, between, any, two, tones, (notes), is, called, an, interval., With, 12, tones, available, we, will, measure, distances, from, one, note, to, the, next, with, 2, basic, types, of, intervals, half, step, and, whole, step., A, half, step, is, a, movement, up(+), or, down(-), one, note, from, any, note., A, whole, step, is, the, movement, up(+), or, down(-), two, notes, from, any, note., All, scales, are, based, on, a, starting, point, known, as, the, "root", note, and, have, an, ending, point, which, is, usually, the, higher, root, note., In, scale, formation, this, root, note, is, also, the, key, name, for, the, scale., For, example,, if, our, scales, starting, point, is, the, C, note, then, its, a, scale, in, the, key, of, C., Now, from, the, root,, when, we, move, up, a, half, step, we, come, to, the, next, available, note., Or, we, can, move, up, a, whole, step, (which, is, up, two, notes), or, a, whole, step, and, a, half, step, which, is, three, notes, etc., Again,, a, scale, generally, starts, on, a, note, and, ends, on, its, higher, note., So, when, creating, a, scale, we, have, a, starting, and, ending, point, and, we, pick, the, notes, we, want, to, use, in, between., Then, we, write, out, a, fomula, based, on, intervals, using, variables;, W=whole, tone,, H=half, tone,, W+=whole, tone+half, tone,2W=two, whole, tones., A, whole, tone, scale, would, be, writen, simply, W+W+W+W+W+W, In, this, example, we, chose, a, starting, note, and, move, in, whole, steps, 6, times, bringing, us, to, the, higher, root, note., This, scale, has, six, different, notes., We, call, this, a, hexatonic, scale,, hex, meaning, six., When, we, play, the, scale, from, beginning, to, end, we, start, on, the, root, note, and, end, on, its, next, higher, root, note., So, with, this, whole, tone, scale, we, play, seven, notes., Once, you, have, your, scale, formed, you, can, start, it, from, any, of, the, twelve, notes., The, scale, intervals, do, not, change., The, starting, note, will, be, key, name, of, your, scale., Note:, even, though, the, intervals, of, one, scale, do, not, change, regardless, of, where, you, choose, to, start, your, scale, each, of, the, twelve, keys, have, a, uniqueness, of, their, own., This, is, partly, due, to, the, fact, that, the, ear, is, hearing, the, scale, melody, at, different, frequencies., That, is, why, some, songs, are, said, to, sound, better, in, certain, keys., However,, this, is, all, a, matter, of, personal, opinion., The, natural, major, Scale, (Ionian), There, are, many, scales, that, have, been, created, and, used, throughout, history., Each, one, with, its, own, unique, sound, (melody)., Today,, one, such, scale, has, become, the, reference, scale, used, to, compare, all, others., This, scale, is, called, the, "natural, major, scale", (Ionian)., The, natural, major, scale, is, made, up, of, seven, individual, notes., The, formula, for, the, scale, is, W,W,H,W,W,W,H., As, with, all, scales,, this, scale, has, a, unique, sound, and, is, the, most, common, scale, in, modern, western, music., Countless, songs, have, been, writen, using, this, scale., In, modern, music, theory, we, know, this, all, important, scale, as, the, "reference, scale", by, which, we, compare, all, the, other, scales., It, is, crucial, that, you, memorize, this, scale, and, know, it, well., Understanding, intervals, in, the, major, scale, The, "key", to, understanding, music, well, is, to, think, in, terms, of, intervals., Intervals, in, music, theory, are, used, to, describe, a, few, different, things., We, already, know, intervals, are, the, distance, between, individual, notes, ie, half, step,, whole, step, and, used, in, scale, formulas., Next, comes, the, magic., Now, once, we, have, a, scale, established, we, can, number, each, note, starting, with, the, root, note., This, alows, us, to, identify, a, notes, position, within, the, scale., In, the, case, of, the, major, scale, we, number, one, through, seven., The, eigth, note, is, the, same, as, the, first, only, higher, in, sound.., Thefore,, this, note, is, called, the, "octave", oct, meaning, eight., Later, in, chordal, theory, we, will, number, past, the, octave, to, describe, complex, chords., But, thats, later., When, playing, any, scale, you, should, be, aware, of, any, notes, position, within, the, scale., This, position, of, any, note, within, a, scale, is, also, known, as, its, interval, but, now, it, is, used, to, define, a, location, within, the, scale., For, example,, if, we, are, playing, the, natural, major, scale, in, the, key, of, C, the, fifth, interval(note), is, G., C,D,E,F,G,A,B,C, Playing, intervals, Playing, intervals, means, that, we, sound, two, different, notes, at, the, same, time., We, start, on, any, given, note, and, construct, the, natural, major, scale., The, root, is, the, first, interval,, then, we, can, choose, any, other, note, to, play, simultaneously, with, it, whether, it, is, related, to, the, scale, or, not., For, example:, based, on, the, C, natural, major, scale,, to, play, a, thirdwe, would, play, the, C, note, and, the, E, note, together, because, E, is, third, in, line., To, play, a, fifth, interval, we, play, C/G,, fourth, C-F, and, so, on., Thirds, are, very, often, used, in, Spanish, music, and, chromatically, in, polynesian, music., Fifths, are, used, to, death!, (rock,, blues,, country, and, middle, eastern, music.), Sixths, are, used, heavily, in, country, western, music, and, ragtime., The, (#), designation, seems, to, have, derived, from, use, of, the, popular, scale, of, C, major, throughout, history, which, has, no, sharps, at, all., C,D,E,F,G,A,B,C, The, natural, Minor, Scale, (Aeolean), The, natural, minor, scale, is, also, a, seven, note, scale., We, could, write, the, formula, out, for, this, scale, using, the, scale, formula, above, however,, now, that, a, reference, scale, has, been, established, we, use, it, instead., This, is, how, it, is, done., We, create, the, natural, minor, scale, by, altering, the, natural, major, scale, (reference, scale)., We, will, use, the, terms, "sharp"(#), or, "flat"(b), meaning, to, chromatically, go, up, or, down, a, half, step, to, alter, the, intervals, of, the, natural, major, scale., Based, on, note, intervals, the, minor, scale, is, 1,2,d3,4,5,d6,d7., This, means, that, we, have, altered, the, natural, major, scale, by, flatting, its, 3rd,, 6th, and, 7th, intervals., If, a, note, is, not, changed, it, is, said, to, be, "natural"., Here, we, have, the, 1st, and, 5th, intervals, natural, also, the, 2nd., When, fifth, intervals, are, played, either, major, or, minor, scales, can, be, played, over, it, since, the, 5th, interval, is, natural, in, both, scales., Therfore,, playing, fifths, do, not, designate, major/minor, key., Rock/blues, music, is, founded, on, this, idea., What, is, a, relative, minor, scale?, The, relative, minor, scale, is, simply, the, sequence, of, notes, of, the, major, scale, that, naturaly, satisfies, the, 1,2,d3,4,5,d6,d7, minor, scale, formula., Any, natural, major, scale, has, a, relative, minor, scale, and, it, always, starts, on, the, 6th, interval., For, example,, the, relative, minor, scale, of, C, major, is, A, minor., This, is, also, known, as, the, 6th, mode, called, the, aeolean., Modes, will, be, discussed, later., To, better, understand, this, lets, look, at, the, C, major, scale., This, scale, has, notes, CDEFGABC., When, we, build, the, minor, scale, we, alter, the, natrl, major, scale, which, is, our, reference, scale., So, in, building, A, minor, we, alter, the, A, major, scale., Using, the, WWHWWWH, formula, to, build, from, the, chromatic, twelve, tones, we, have, A,B,C#,D,E,F#,G#,A., We, can, see, that, this, A, major, scale, has, three, sharped, notes, and, that, is, exactly, how, this, key, is, notated, on, the, musical, staff., When, we, now, alter, the, scale, with, b3,b6,b7, we, end, up, with, A,B,C,D,E,F,G., Those, are, all, natural, notes, in, the, C, major, scale!, So, whenever, we, start, on, a, major, scales, sixth, interval, and, play, to, its, octave,, we, are, playing, its, relative, minor, scale, also, known, as, the, Aeolian, mode., Pentatonic, scales, As, mentioned, earlier, there, have, been, many, scales, formed, throughout, time., In, western, music, one, scale, has, been, used, quite, often, in, blues, and, rock-n-roll, music, and, country, music., It, is, a, pentatonic, scale, consisting, of, five, notes, "penta", meaning, five., Based, on, the, major, scale, the, formula, for, the, major, pentatonic, is, 1-2-3-5-6., The, minor, is, 1-d3-4-5-d7., When, playing, over, fifth, intervals, you, can, play, either, the, major, or, minor, pentatonic, whichever, you, choose, since, fifths, dont, dictate, either, minor, or, major, key., Blues, music, often, uses, the, minor., Country, and, rock-n-roll, music, tends, to, use, both., Up, Chordal, Theory, When, we, have, a, scale, created, we, can, then, build, chords, from, the, notes, contained, within, it.., Chords, are, generally, constructed, bye, linking, third, intervals, of, the, major, scale, and, this, creates, harmony., A, chord, (triad), must, have, at, least, three, different, notes, "tri", meaning, three., The, most, important, thing, to, remember, in, chordal, theory, is, that, chords, are, built, from, natural, or, altered, notes, of, the, natural, major, scale, and, are, notated, in, relation, to, that, scale., The, Major, Triad, The, major, triad, consists, of, three, notes, "triad", meaning, three., The, formula, for, a, major, triad, is, 1-3-5., This, is, the, first,, third, and, fifth, intervals(notes), of, the, major, scale., For, example, from, the, C, major, scale, we, would, get, C-E-G., This, is, the, C, major, triad, usually, notated, as, just, the, letter, C., The, chord, gets, it, name, from, the, scale, that, it, was, formed, from, and, the, major, designation, because, everything, is, natural., No, alterations., The, Minor, Triad, The, minor, triad, also, consists, of, three, notes., The, formula, for, a, minor, triad, is, 1-d3-5., Again, we, always, use, the, major, scale, as, our, reference., Just, as, we, altered, the, major, scale, to, create, the, minor, scale, so, do, we, to, create, chords., We, see, that, we, use, the, natural, 1st, and, 5th, intervals, of, the, major, scale, however, we, alter, the, 3rd, interval, by, flatting, it., So, if, we, are, using, the, C, major, scale, as, reference, we, have, C-Ed-G, because, E, is, the, 3rd, interval, of, the, C, major, scale., So, we, have, a, C, minor, triad., This, chord, is, notated, as, Cmin, or, Cm., Again,, it, gets, its, name, from, the, scale, of, which, it, was, created, and, the, minor, designations, because, of, the, flatted, third, interval., You, can, think, of, the, flatted, third, as, a, "minored", third., Minor, meaning, lesser, or, flat., The, most, important, third, interval:The, King, of, notes, It, can, now, be, clearly, seen, that, the, third, interval, of, the, major, scale, is, very, important, in, chord, construction., If, its, unchanged, or, "natural", it, produces, a, major, chord, sound, if, it, is, flatted, (or, minored), it, produces, a, minor, chord, sound., Two, very, different, sounds., As, we, saw, in, scale, construction, it, also, dictates, whether, a, scale, is, minor, or, major., This, is, the, most, important, note, in, all, music, theory., Inverting, and, voicing, chords, When, playing, a, chord, we, can, change, the, sound, to, some, extent, without, adding, or, deleting, notes, which, would, produce, a, different, chord., "Inverting", the, chord, is, one, way., This, means, instead, of, playing, the, chords, root, note, first, we, start, the, chord, with, one, of, its, other, intervals., However,, with, inversions, we, are, not, changing, the, sequence, of, the, notes., For, example,, if, we, want, to, invert, a, C, major, triad, we, can, play, G-C-E, or, E-G-C., As, you, can, see, the, sequence, of, the, notes, dont, change, only, the, starting, point., The, sound, will, be, slightly, different, particulary, if, a, bass, instrument, is, playing, the, inverted, bass, note., "Voicing", a, chord, is, one, other, way., With, "voicing", we, do, change, the, sequence, order, the, notes, are, played., Again, we, arent, adding, any, new, notes, or, removing, any, essential, notes., We, are, merely, arranging, them, in, a, different, order., When, we, do, this, the, ear, hears, some, differnent, intervals, it, didnt, before., For, example,, we, could, play, that, same, C, major, triad, like, this, G-E-C-G-C., Not, only, did, we, change, the, order, of, the, three, notes, but, this, chord, spans, two, and, a, half, octaves!, The, sound, is, a, bit, different, and, is, spread, out, more., A, chord, can, span, as, many, octaves, as, you, like, using, inversions, or, different, voicings, however,, as, long, as, the, foundation, notes(in, this, case, the, triad, notes), are, the, only, notes,, the, chords, name, doesnt, change.Up, Complex, chords, Now, that, we, understand, triads, we, can, build, upon, them, further., We, can, add, more, notes., We, call, these, "complex, chords"., When, we, build, upon, a, major, triad, there, are, rules, that, we, need, to, memorize, to, do, it, properly, and, also, to, understand, chord, notation., Major, chords, When, we, add, the, seventh, interval, to, the, major, triad, we, add, "maj", and, the, interval, that, is, added, to, the, chord, notation., For, example,, when, we, add, the, B, note, (seventh, interval), to, a, C, major, triad, we, now, note, it, as, Cmaj7., So, 1-3-5-7, is, the, formula, for, any, maj7, chord., A, 6th, chord, is, major, but, is, notated, with, merely, a, 6, extension., Example, a, C, chord, with, notes, 1-3-5-6-9, would, be, notated, as, C6/9, When, intervals, are, added, above, eight, (the, octave),, they, are, counted, 9,10,11,12,13,14, However,, we, know, that, the, eigth,, tenth,, and, twelth, note, are, merely, repeats, of, the, triad, notes, an, octave, lower, and, if, its, a, maj7, chord, the, fourteenth, is, a, repeat, of, the, seventh, so, we, dont, need, to, count, them, again., So, the, only, new, notes, that, can, be, added, from, the, major, scale, are, the, 2nd,, 4th, and, 6th, intervals, respectfully, 9,11,13., Most, commonly, complex, chords, are, voiced, using, these, 9,11,13, intervals, to, spread, the, sound, out, more, so, they, notes, dont, tonally, clash, with, the, the, other, notes, by, being, all, in, the, same, octave., No, matter, how, you, decide, to, voice, a, maj7, or, min7, chord, it, should, be, notated, with, the, 9,11,13, extensions., The, seven, is, often, dropped, because, when, the, "maj", is, notated, it, means, the, seventh, is, present., So, a, C, chord, with, 1-3-5-7-9-11-13, contains, all, the, notes, of, the, major, scale, and, would, be, written, as, Cmaj9/11/13., When, the, seventh, is, not, present, we, notate, "add", and, then, the, interval., ie, 1-3-5-9, is, notated, Cadd9., We, can, even, add, more, dissonance, to, any, chord, by, sharping, or, flatting, any, of, the, extensions., For, example, 1-3-5-7-#9-#11-#13, based, on, the, C, major, scale, is, a, Cmaj#9/#11#13., We, know, its, a, major, chord, because, the, natural, third, and, then, we, notate, it, with, "maj", because, the, seventh, is, also, present, and, finally, we, notate, the, sharped, extensions., Dominant, seven, chords, A, dominant, seven, chord, is, a, major, triad, with, a, flatted, seventh, interval., The, formula, for, a, dominant, seven, chord, is, 1-3-5-d7., By, flatting, the, seventh, interval, we, create, tension, in, the, chord., Dominant, seven, chords, are, notated, as, merely, a, 7, added, to, the, root, note., If, we, build, on, dom, 7, chords, we, merely, add, the, new, higher, interval, to, the, root, note, and, drop, the, 7., Example,, a, C7, chord, with, the, 9th, interval, added, would, be, notated, as, C9., If, we, also, add, an, 11th, we, drop, the, 9th, and, note, it, as, C11, and, so, forth., So, it, is, understood, in, chord, notation, that, all, the, dom., intervals, preceding, are, present., Any, sharped, extensions, to, the, 9th, and, 11th, or, 13th, intervals, must, be, notated., Reminder,, if, the, natural, seventh, (14th, equiv.), is, also, present, it, should, be, notated, with, "maj", ofcourse., Lastly,, if, we, want, to, add, any, interval, not, consecutive, to, the, flatted, seventh, we, add, it, on, ie., C7/11., Dominant, seven, chords, are, still, major, in, sound, because, the, third, interval, is, natural., Minor, chords, Most, notation, rules, that, apply, to, major, chords, apply, to, minor, except, when, noting, extensions, we, never, drop, the, seventh, because, it, is, not, implied., Remeber, a, chord, is, minor, when, the, third, interval, is, flatted., We, notate, minor, chords, with, "min", or, "m"., When, we, add, the, natural, seventh, like, in, the, maj7, chord, we, must, note, it, min/maj7, because, the, natural, seventh, interval, is, present., Therfore,, if, a, C, chord, has, 1-d3-5-7, it, would, be, notated, Cmmaj7., This, chord, is, still, ultimately, minor, in, sound, because, of, the, flatted, third, but, with, a, slight, major, sound., If, the, seventh, is, flatted, it, is, notated, with, the, 7, extension, just, as, are, dominant, chords, ie., Cmin7., Again,, we, must, use, "min", or, "m", to, show, that, the, third, is, flatted, making, the, chord, minor., Here, is, an, example, of, a, chord, that, uses, all, the, notes, of, the, minor, scale, Cmin7/9/11/d13, remember, the, 7th, is, flat., The, important, seventh, interval, As, we, can, now, see,, the, seventh, interval, is, also, very, important, in, chord, building., When, it, is, added,, depending, on, it, being, left, natural, or, flatted,, will, determine, whether, a, major, triad, will, be, major, or, dominant, in, sound., In, a, minor, triad, it, will, determine, whether, it, is, minor, or, partially, major, in, sound., In, addition, to, the, root, note, and, third,, the, seventh, interval, is, the, most, important, note, in, complex, chord, building., Because, the, third, and, seventh, intervals, dictate, the, type, and, sound, of, a, chord, they, are, called, "color, tones", In, major/minor, chords, the, fifth, interval, doesnt, dictate, major, or, minor, sound, at, all, and, because, the, other, extensions, all, create, tension/dissonance, and, character, the, fifth, is, the, least, important, note, and, can, even, be, left, out., It, merely, strengthens, the, existing, sound, by, completing, the, triad., However,, in, the, last, two, chords, we, will, discuss, the, 5th, is, quite, significant., Diminished, Chords, A, diminshed, chord, creates, tension, because, it, is, minor, in, sound, and, the, fifth, interval, is, flatted(diminished)., Because, it, also, has, a, flatted, third, we, might, think, of, it, as, a, minor, chord, however,, it, isnt, a, minor, triad, because, the, fifth, is, flatted, so, it, is, in, a, category, all, its, own., Diminished, chords, have, a, unique, sound., This, chord, is, notated, "dim", or, "0"., ie, Cdim/, C°, Augmented, chords, Augmented, chords, create, tension, because, its, major, in, sound, and, has, the, fifth, interval, sharped#., Because, it, has, a, natural, third, it, is, major, in, sound, but, the, sharped, fifth, creates, dissonance., Likewise, we, might, think, of, this, as, major, chord, because, of, the, natural, third, however, the, fifth, is, altered, so, it, is, in, a, category, all, its, own., This, chord, is, notated, "aug", or, "+"., ie., Caug/C+Up, Chord, Progression, Theory, As, mentioned, earier,, when, we, have, a, scale, we, can, build, chords, from, the, notes, therein., We, have, covered, all, the, chords, and, now, we, want, to, see, what, kinds, can, be, built, using, only, the, natural, notes, of, a, scale., Using, the, C, major, scale, as, our, reference, we, find, we, can, build, these, triads, off, of, the, notes, of, the, scale:, C, Major,, D, minor,, E, minor,, F, Major,, G, Major,, A, minor, and, Bdim, These, triads, are, numbered, numbered, according, to, their, roots, position, in, the, scale., For, example, the, F, note, is, the, fourth, interval, in, the, major, scale, so, this, is, the, fourth, triad., We, us, roman, numerals, to, notate, these, chords., We, can, see, this, fourth, interval, triad, is, major, so, we, use, upper, case, IV., The, second, interval, triad, is, minor, so, we, use, lower, case, ii., If, we, want, to, add, extensions, we, can, add, on, the, interval, number, like, so, ii7., For, dominant, chords, just, write, dom, before, the, roman, numeral, example:, domI,, domIV,, domV., Chord, progressions, are, written, this, way., Musicians, need, only, know, the, chord, progression, in, this, way, to, easily, play, in, any, of, the, 12, keys., This, is, because, the, order, of, the, progression, doesnt, change., Thats, why, thinking, musically, in, terms, of, intervals, is, the, "magic, key", to, understanding, and, playing, music, well., Once, we, have, the, triads, we, can, add, extensions, onto, them,, creating, complex, chords, into, our, progression, using, the, things, learned, from, the, section, on, "chord, theory".Up, Exotic, scales, For, myself,, one, of, the, most, exciting, discoveries, in, music, is, playing, foreign, scales., When, you, have, played, with, western, scales, for, a, long, time, the, chord, progressions, become, kind, of, old, and, you, use, the, same, ones, over, and, over., When, we, study, a, foreign, scale, we, find, different, intervals, and, therfore, a, different, melody., These, scales, have, their, own, unique, sound, and, it, is, when, we, start, to, build, chords, from, their, intervals, that, we, see, the, magic., We, find, ourselves, creating, different, chord, progressions, than, we, were, with, the, western, scales, because, the, different, intervals, dictate, this., We, sometimes, also, find, ourselves, using, chords, that, we, wouldnt, normally, use, also, and, in, different, places, as, well., When, building, chords, from, new, scales, follow, the, same, procedure, as, above, but, first, determine, whether, it, is, a, major, or, minor, scale, by, looking, at, the, important, third, interval., Start, with, each, interval, and, based, on, the, natural, notes,, try, to, build, triads,, diminished, or, augmented, chords, or, merely, fifths, (common, with, many, eastern, scales)., When, you, have, many, chords, built, we, can, then, build, a, progression., Once, a, progression, is, built, we, can, create, melody, over, the, top, and, suddenly, a, foreign, music, we, have, never, ever, played, before, starts, to, develop, and, it, sounds, fluent!Up, Understanding, Modes, A, scale, that, is, built, from, the, natural, notes, of, one, scale, is, called, a, mode, of, that, scale., If, there, are, seven, notes, in, a, given, scale, then, there, will, be, seven, modes, available., Each, mode, has, a, unique, melody, because, of, the, different, intervals., The, most, commonly, used, are, the, modes, of, the, natural, major, scale., However,, every, scale, has, modes, whether, it, be, the, natural, major, scale, or, a, foreign, scale, like, the, spanish, gypsy, (one, of, my, favorites)., Remember, they, are, technically, each, a, different, scale., Since, we, are, starting, at, different, points, within, the, reference, scale, and, playing, to, its, octave,, each, modes, interval, formula, (ie., whole, step,, half, step), are, different., For, the, natural, major, scale, there, are, 7, modes, one, for, every, note, of, the, major, scale., Earlier, we, talked, about, the, relative, minor, scale., It, is, the, sixth, mode, of, the, major, scale,, called, the, aeolean, mode., We, started, on, the, sixth, interval., A, mode, is, referenced, according, to, its, root, note, just, like, any, other, scale., The, mode, name, is, based, on, the, notes, position, within, the, reference, scale., Based, on, the, triads, built, off, each, interval, we, can, know, whether, a, mode, is, minor, or, major, quickly., So,, using, the, C, natural, major, scale, as, our, reference, scale, we, have, these, modes, naturaly, associated, with, their, root, triads:, C, Major(Ionian, mode),, D, minor(Dorian, mode),, E, minor(Phrygian, mode),, F, Major(Lydian, mode),, G, Major(Mixolydian),, A, minor(Aeleon, mode), and, Bdim(Locrian, mode), Here, are, all, seven, of, these, modes, according, to, their, position, in, the, major, scale, and, their, formulas, based, also, on, the, major, scale, from, which, each, was, formed, and, whether, it, is, major, or, minor., Root-, Ionian, Mode, (natural, major, scale), 2nd-, Dorian, (minor), 1-2-d3-4-5-6-d7, 3rd-, Phrygian, (minor), 1-d2-d3-4-5-d6-d7, 4th-, Lydian, (major), 1-2-3-#4-5-6-7, 5th-, Mixolydian, (major), 1-2-3-4-5-6-d7, 6th-, Aeolean, (, natural, minor), 1-2-d3-4-5-d6-d7, 7th-, Locrian, (dim, minor7), 1-d2-d3-4-d5-d6-d7, Up, Applying, the, modes, So, how, do, we, use, the, modes?, Easy., Look, the, chord, progression!, You, can, play, a, different, mode, over, every, chord, change., For, example, the, Dorian, mode, is, minor, because, it, has, a, flat, third, and, natural, fifth, so, we, can, play, over, a, basic, minor, triad, and, also, minor7, chords, because, it, has, a, d7, also., Even, if, we, have, a, progression, using, min7, chords, like, iv7,v7,i7, we, could, play, a, Dorian, mode, over, each, chord, change, and, still, be, ok, because, our, modes, have, the, essential, triad, notes, of, each, chord., For, example, if, this, progression, is, in, A, minor, we, have:, Dmin7,, Emin7, and, Amin7., So, we, would, play, D, dorian,, E, dorian, and, A, dorian, scales., However,, if, we, wanted, to, stay, entirely, key, related, (meaning, not, using, any, modes, with, unnatural, notes, of, the, A, minor, scale), we, could, simply, play, the, modes, associated, with, each, chord, interval;, D, dorian,, E, phrygian, and, A, aeolean, scales., How, did, I, determine, this?, Because, the, the, A, minor, scales, relative, major, scale, is, C, major., All, the, chords, in, the, progression, are, centered, around, the, C, major, scale, so, it, is, the, reference, scale, we, use, know, what, modes, naturaly, relate, to, the, progression., As, long, as, you, are, following, the, basic, rules, you, can, do, what, you, want., Jazz, players, do, this, a, lot., For, example,, if, I, wanted, to, get, Jazzy, using, the, dorian, minor, mode,, I, might, create, a, progression, like, i7,iv7,v7., This, is, a, minor, 1-4-5, progression, using, min7, chords., I, might, play, a, dorian, mode, over, each, change., For, a, jazy, mixolydian, sound, mixolydian, modes, over, each, change, of, a, I9-IV9-V9, progression., Make, sense?, Vintage, blues, was, 12, bars, of, domI,, domIV,domI,, domV,, domIV,domI., The, fifth, mode, the, Mixolydian, has, the, flat, seven, and, is, major, so, we, can, think, of, it, as, the, dominant, mode., So, we, could, play, this, mode, over, each, chord, change., Ofcourse,, you, might, play, a, minor, pentatonic, scale, or, ever, change, for, the, vintage, blues, sound., I, like, to, mix, things, up, and, use, both., If, you, want, to, play, certain, modes, you, should, write, chord, progressions, based, on, the, modes, you, want, to, play., As, with, the, blues, example, above;, the, primary, mode, would, be, the, mixolydian., Jazz, does, this, quite, often-, playing, modes, over, each, chord, and, changing, keys, often, also., In, conclusion,, each, mode, has, a, unique, melody, and, is, to, be, used, over, the, chord(s), they, can, form., Solo, tip;, When, playing, modes, over, each, chord, change, in, a, progression, I, like, to, use, "chromaticism"(moving, up, or, down, in, half, tones), and, quite, often, it, sounds, cool., Look, for, those, opportunities., Like, in, 12, bar, blues, I, use, chromaticism, when, the, V-IV, change, occurs., When, playing, the, minor, or, major, pentatonic, I, like, to, use, chromaticism, between, the, 4-5,, d7-1,, d3-4, and, 2/3,, 5-6,, 1-2, intervals, respectfully., I, hope, all, this, material, helps, many, of, you, out,
