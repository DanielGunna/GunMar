Americans, take, a, daily, multivitamin., Health, experts, agree, that, certain, groups, of, people, can, clearly, benefit, from, a, multivitamin,, especially, women, who, are, pregnant, or, may, become, pregnant., Others, may, not, need, a, multivitamin, because, the, majority, of, Americans, get, plenty, of, nutrients, from, their, daily, diet., However,, most, experts, say, there, is, no, harm, in, taking, a, daily, multivitamin, and, it, might, help, with, nutrient, balance, if,, for, example,, you, can't, stand, eating, your, veggies,, or, eat, a, restricted, diet, for, whatever, reason., However,, if, you, have, any, health, concerns,, pre-existing, conditions,, or, take, other, supplements, or, medications,, always, check, with, your, health, care, provider, before, adding, a, multivitamin, into, your, regimen., Also, check, with, your, child's, pediatrician, before, giving, your, child, a, multivitamin., We, do, not, cover, multivitamins, for, children, because, most, experts, say, you, should, not, give, your, child, supplements, without, a, specific, recommendation, from, a, health-care, provider., The, FDA, made, an, important, change, to, its, folate/folic, acid, recommendations, The, FDA, announced, in, July, of, 2016, that, it, was, making, changes, to, the, way, it, measures, folate,, which, is, naturally, occurring, in, foods,, and, folic, acid,, the, synthetic, form, of, folate., Since, synthetic, folate, is, metabolized, differently, than, naturally-derived, folate, from, food,, synthetic, folates, are, considered, to, be, a, higher, concentration, than, they, used, to, be., The, new, labeling, takes, into, account, both, micrograms, (mcg), and, "dietary, folate, equivalents", (DFE)., So,, for, example,, if, the, folate, levels, in, a, supplement, are, exclusively, from, synthetic, folate, and, currently, are, listed, at, 800, mcg,, it, will,, in, the, future,, be, listed, as, 1,360, mcg, DFE, (the, ratio, is, 1:1.7, for, folic, acid,, 1:1, for, naturally, occurring, folate)., This, means, that,, currently,, almost, all, prenatal, multivitamins, with, folic, acid, as, its, folate, source, are, actually, higher,, sometimes, much, higher,, than, the, recommended, RDA, for, folate,, in, spite, of, what, the, label, says., However,, since, these, rules, have, not, yet, taken, effect,, the, current, supplements, are, considered, to, be, truthful, in, their, labeling, and, still, pass, in, testing, for, that., These, labeling, changes, will, take, effect, from, July, of, 2018, to, July, 2019., While, there, are, legitimate, concerns, about, ingesting, too, much, folate, because, it, can, mask, other, issues,, that, is, very, rare, and, generally, happens, at, much, higher, levels, of, supplementation., In, the, meantime,, the, take, home, message, is, this:, if, you're, pregnant,, folate, supplementation, is, highly, recommended., Work, with, your, doctor, to, find, the, right, type, and, amount, of, folate, for, you., Types, of, Multivitamins, Multivitamins, for, Adults, over, 50, Multivitamins, for, Women, Prenatal, Vitamins, Multivitamins, for, Men, Multivitamins, for, Adults, over, 50, The, reason, that, there, are, so, many, vitamins, targeting, adults, over, age, 50, is, because, they, have, different, nutritional, needs, than, their, younger, selves., Older, adults, typically, need, more, B, vitamins,, especially, B-12,, more, calcium,, less, iron, (especially, women),, less, folate,, and, may, benefit, from, a, thermogenic, ingredient,, which, can, help, burn, calories., Some, companies, even, make, multivitamins, specifically, for, older, men, or, women,, with, tweaks, to, their, formulas, targeting, that, demographic., One, thing, you, do, need, to, watch, out, for:, if, you, take, a, blood, thinner,, vitamin, K, can, interfere, with, it,, so, be, sure, to, check, with, your, doctor.Multivitamins, for, Women, Experts, agree:, all, women, of, childbearing, age, should, take, a, multivitamin, containing, folate, or, folic, acid., Even, though, you, may, not, be, intending, to, conceive,, if, you, do,, the, risk, of, neural, tube, defects, is, greatly, increased, without, this, supplement., The, recommended, daily, allowance , of, folate, for, women, ages, 14, and, up, is, 400, mcg, DFE, (which, represents, the, FDA's, newest, measurements, for, folate, as, micrograms, dietary, folate, equivalents)., Multivitamins, targeted, at, women, under, age, 50, reflect, these, needs,, and,, in, addition,, often, provide, other, nutrients,, like, iron,, that, menstruating, women, may, lack.Prenatal, Vitamins, As, noted, above,, all, women, of, childbearing, age, should, take, a, daily, multivitamin, with, at, least, 400, mcg, DFE, of, folate., Pregnant, and, breastfeeding, women, need, even, more, folic, acid, –, 600, and, 500, mcg, DFE,, respectively., Again,, these, reflect, the, FDA's, latest, guidelines, in, measuring, folate, supplements,, making, it, even, more, important, that, you, discuss, .,  your, supplement, needs, with, your, doctor.Multivitamins, for, Men, Vitamins, targeted, at, men, often, have, formulations, that, specifically, claim, to, benefit, prostrate, or, heart, health., While, these, statements, have, not, been, evaluated, by, the, FDA,, the, fact, is, that, men, can, benefit, from, a, multivitamin, made, for, them., For, one, thing,, men, generally, don't, need, more, than, 8, mg, (milligrams), of, iron, a, day,, which, is, easy, to, get, from, diet, alone,, so, men's, formulas, tend, to, be, very, low, in, iron., Are, multivitamins, safe?, Enacted, in, 1994,, the, Dietary, Supplement, Health, and, Education, Act, (DSHEA), restricts, the, ability, of, the, U.S., Food, and, Drug, Administration, (FDA), to, regulate, supplements, or, ensure, the, safety, of, their, ingredients., Under, this, act,, the, FDA, is, limited, to, collecting, information, on, adverse, side, effects, and, to, monitoring, labeling, claims., That, means, the, most, the, FDA, can, do, is, pull, a, product, off, store, shelves, after, a, problem, becomes, apparent., It's, up, to, the, manufacturer, to, ensure, that, its, multivitamins, and, supplements, are, safe., Under, DSHEA,, multivitamins, don't, require, FDA, approval,, and, manufacturers, aren't, required, to, register, their, supplements, with, the, FDA, before, putting, them, on, the, market., In, an, ideal, world,, manufacturers, would, be, diligent, about, the, safety, of, their, multivitamins, and, truth, in, labeling., However,, as, professional, testing, shows,, consumers, need, to, be, concerned, about, multivitamin, quality., Among, 45, products, evaluated, by, ConsumerLab.com,, 15, fail, at, least, one, test., Many, don't, meet, the, nutrient, claims, on, the, label,, others, improperly, list, ingredients., It's, not, unusual, for, a, multivitamin, to, exceed, the, upper, limit, (UL), for, niacin, and, yet, stay, off, of, the, "not, approved", lists, of, most, professional, testing, organizations., That's, because, niacin, has, thermogenic, properties, and, is, often, targeted, to, other, purposes,, such, as, increased, energy,, weight, loss, or, lowering, cholesterol., However,, it's, important, to, note, that, niacin, can, cause, flushing, and, tingling, at, high, doses, --, and, more, serious, side, effects, in, a, small, minority, of, the, population., Again,, check, with, your, health, care, provider, if, you, have, any, concerns., (To, read, more, about, thermogenic, supplements,, read, our, evaluation, in, our, report, on, Diet, Pills.), Regardless, of, existing, regulations,, consumers, should, be, skeptical, about, health, claims, listed, on, multivitamin, labels., While, the, original, provisions, of, DSHEA, require, that, manufacturers, make, no, claims, about, their, products, preventing, or, curing, diseases,, some, do, so, anyway., Keep, in, mind,, there, are, no, studies, to, show, that, any, supplement, can, prevent, or, cure, any, condition, (with, the, notable, exceptions, of, iodine, and, folic, acid)., The, only, reason, for, the, average, person, to, take, a, multivitamin, is, to, ensure, you, have, a, full, range, of, daily, nutrients,, especially, if, you, don't, eat, a, balanced, diet., Finding, The, Best, Multivitamins, Our,
