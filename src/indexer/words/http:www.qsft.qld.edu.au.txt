1992, WHAT, OUR, STUDENTS, SAY, QSFT, SUCCESS, STORY, &, INDUSTRY, TIPS, –, “Jake, Koning”, Learning, Experience, QSFT, SUCCESS, STORY, &, INDUSTRY, TIPS, –, “Peter, Stagg”, "I, would, like, to, sincerely, thank, you, for, the, opportunity, to, work, on, “Dinner, at, 117”, with, Geoff, Cox., The, experience, has, been, one, of, the, most, enjoyable, in, my, life, and, has, provided, me, with, the, best, opportunity, for, finding, work, in, the, film, industry., To, be, able, to, demonstrate, a, feature, film, credit, so, early, in, my, career, is, a, boon, that, I, would, not, have, dared, to, dream, of., The, trust, you, have, shown, is, a, boost, to, my, confidence, in, the, abilities, I, have, earned, whilst, studying, for, my, Diploma, of, Film, and, Television, at, QSFT., I, look, forward, to, many, more, opportunities, to, demonstrate, the, skills, and, aptitude, gained, from, my, study, at, the, school., From, this, shoot, and, others,, I, have, begun, to, notice, a, familiar, trend., QSFT, graduates, seem, to, find, positions, within, film, crews., In, conversations, with, people, within, the, industry, I, have, noticed, that, the, graduates, of, other, institutions, are, strangely, absent., I, believe, that, the, students, (both, past, and, present), of, the, QSFT, carried, themselves, in, a, professional, manner, that, matched, their, knowledge, and, abilities, to, perform, the, tasks, entrusted, to, them.", Matthew, Greig,, QSFT, Graduate, "The, biggest, advantage, to, studying, at, QSFT, is, that, the, small, class, sizes, mean, you, develop, a, great, bond, and, rapport, with, your, fellow, students., It’s, almost, like, an, exclusive, club., You, grow, together, and, learn, from, each, other, over, the, two, years,, and, when, you, graduate, you, have, an, established, network, of, contacts., Even, years, after, graduation, I’m, still, close, to, my, former, classmates, and, we, help, each, other, when, it, comes, to, finding, work., We, recommend, each, other, and, in, some, cases, employ, each, other, because, we’re, familiar, with, each, other’s, work, and, know, the, level, of, training, has, been, high., QSFT, emphasizes, the, importance, of, learning, every, area, of, film, and, TV, so, when, you, enter, the, workforce, you, have, an, understanding, of, the, whole, process, and, are, better, able, to, work, as, part, of, a, team., I, found, this, focus, invaluable, when, it, came, time, to, decide, on, a, speciality, -, I, could, do, so, with, confidence, having, a, firm, grasp, on, the, demands, of, every, area., The, school’s, flexibility, is, also, a, big, plus, for, me., Being, able, to, work, on, assignments, at, home, and, structure, study, around, work, and, other, activities, made, it, that, much, easier, to, spend, time, on, the, thing, I, love, most, –, making, films.", Gareth, Burner,, QSFT, Graduate, Queensland, School, of, Film, and, Television, was, the, best, school, I, found, to, offer, a, high, level, of, hands-on, training, covering, a, wide, range, of, areas., Their, lecturers, are, very, experienced, in, the, industry, and, full, of, knowledge., To, me,, they, passed, on, all, their, experience, and, some, very, valuable, contacts., It, is, for, these, reasons, that, I, can, highly, recommend, QSFT., Amy, Creighton,, QSFT, Graduate, "By, attending, Queensland, School, of, Film, and, Television, I, have, gained, the, skills, and, the, knowledge, to, help, me, obtain, work, in, the, film, industry., I, have, learned, how, the, industry, functions, from, industry, professionals, and, have, received, strong, support, from, the, school, while, studying, and, preparing, for, jobs., This, course, has, helped, me, immensely, in, plotting, my, future, career, as, First, Assistant, Director, and, I, know, that, I, will, always, be, a, part, of, a, strong, support, network, even, after, I, graduate", Jayne, Herrmann,, QSFT, Graduate, QSFT, NEWS, 24,
