refers, to, creations, of, the, mind,, such, as, inventions,, literary,, scholarly, and, artistic, works,, designs,, symbols,, names,, and, images., But, what, does, it, mean, to, own, ideas,, music,, art,, or, designs, as, property?, Is, it, a, bellwether, of, capitalist, logic, or, a, vital, guardian, of, individual, creation?,  And, what, do, we, make, of, current, attempts, to, blur, the, lines, between, creation, and, appropriation, such, as, musical, “mash-ups”, and, mixed, media, literature, in, our, current, moment, or, in, cultural, borrowings, of, the, past, (such, as, the, recitation, of, works, by, “Homer”)?  Are, these, instances, of, intellectual, property, or, of, piracy?, At, this, moment, of, digital, reproduction, and, manipulation,, crowd, sourcing,, sharing,
