Reviewed, by, Daniel, Herwitz, ,, University, of, Michigan, This, book, attempts, an, analytic, reconstruction, of, how, picturing, takes, place, in, painting., Ranging, from, mediaeval, figuration, to, contemporary, abstraction,, the, book, argues, that, the, two-dimensional, surface, of, the, picture, plane, can, be, understood, to, provide, something, like, the, basis, for, a, set, of, distinctive, logical, spaces, through, which, picturing, can, happen., These, logical, spaces, are, what, allow, the, varieties, of, picturing, which, the, history, of, art, has, exhibited., They, are, the, condition, of, the, possibility, of, such, styles, of, picturing., Terms, like, ‘logical, space’,, ‘pictorial, syntax’, and, ‘pictorial, content’, or, ‘semantics’, are, liberally, applied, throughout, this, book,, with, comparatively, little, (if, any), discussion, of, what, would, be, at, stake, in, thinking, of, painting, as, a, kind, of, visual, language., Indeed,, these, terms, tend, to, run, together, without, notice,, leading, the, reader, to, wonder, whether, what, is, at, stake, is, pictorial, syntax,, a, theory, of, meaning, for, pictorial, content,, or, just, plain, discussions, of, the, grounds, of, style,, and, to, question, the, entire, force, of, the, analogy, between, style, and, language., It, is, best, to, get, at, Crowther’s, view, by, considering, the, starting, point, of, the, book,, namely, Panofsky’s, theory, of, perspective., Panofsky, attempts, to, understand, how, certain, styles, are, undergirded, by, specific, categories, of, form, and, (relatedly), how, changes, in, pictorial, style, can, be, accounted, for, through, changes, in, these, categories., Crucial, to, Panofsky’s, account, is, that, categories, of, form—for, example, the, geometrically, based, theory, of, perspective, which, grounds, (much), renaissance, art—define, pictorial, schemes, through, which, style, becomes, iterable, (capable, of, repetition, and, variation, according, to, the, pattern),, but, also, that, these, categories, are, achieved, through, history., While, forms, arise, historically,, their, analytic, reconstruction, is, transhistorical,, like, the, synchronic, reconstruction, of, language., Art, history, gives, rise, to, transhistorical, forms, that, can, be, given, analytic, reconstruction., It, is, this, project, (variously, denoted, as, syntactic,, semantic, and, logical), that, Crowther, is, involved, in, elaborating., He, is, in, this, respect, Panofsky’s, student., A, style, is, bounded:, a, closed, universe, of, types, admitting, of, no, alternatives., Crowther, is,, through, Cassirer, and, Panofsky,, neo-Kantian,, and, (to, state, what, I, take, the, key, to, this, book, to, be), it, follows, that, he, is, emphatically, not, Aristotelian, or, Wittgensteinian, about, style., Style, is, no, loose, aggregate, of, forms,, linked, together, in, terms, of, multiple, criss-crossings, or, family, resemblances,, with, potentially, innumerable, additions., A, style, is, a, systematic, schema, through, which, a, two-dimensional, surface, can, project, figure-and-ground, relationships,, and, thus, signify, pictorially., What, is, boldly, and, emphatically, behind, this, book’s, opposition, to, many, current, tendencies, in, art, historical, thought, (and, the, humanities, generally), is, its, claim, to, limn, these, various, closed, schemata,, once, and, for, all,, and, to, prove, that, the, variations, one, in, fact, finds, within, styles, (renaissance,, abstract,, etc.), are, encompassed, by, the, determinate, categories, that, comprise, each, schema., Schemes, are, stylistic, essences,, even, if, they, are, achieved, through, history, and, may, have, in, some, cases, historical, endpoints, (meaning, they, have, passed, out, of, actual, art-making)., The, second, component, to, Crowther’s, style, of, analytic, reconstruction, is, the, claim, that, the, determination, of, a, stylistic, essence, (i.e., a, schema, for, a, type, of, picturing), allows, for, the, reconstruction, of, the, field, of, actual, pictorial, examples, (of, perspectival, painting,, abstraction—whatever), to, show, how, this, field, can, be, clearly, denoted, and, explained, as, falling, under, the, stylistic, type., The, kind, of, analytic, reconstruction, offered, in, this, book, is, closer, in, spirit, to, German, idealism, (the, Hegel, of, the, Logic, whose, reconstructions, of, empirical, history, prove, them, logically/dialectically, necessary, as, fields, of, thought), than, to, analytical, philosophy., It, is, fascinating, to, see, such, analysis, resuscitated, and,, in, some, places,, expertly, employed., The, problem, with, this, book, for, a, reader, like, myself, is, that, one, comes, away, from, it, with, the, nagging, suspicion, that, many, of, Crowther’s, attempts, to, provide, a, determinate, set, of, categories, (logically, necessary, for, a, kind, of, pictorial, style), are, ad, hoc., One, felt, this, about, his, idealist, predecessors, as, well., This, is, the, kind, of, book, that, does, not, solicit, engagement, but, accord., It, is, as, if, Crowther, is, lecturing, on, the, basis, of, having, solved, everything,, and, one, feels, that, his, choices, of, categories, and, examples, always, conceal, alternatives—and, do, so, without, adequate, acknowledgment., For, example, the, author, claims, that, abstract, picturing, comes, (and, must, come), in, exactly, four, kinds,, corresponding, to, four, logical, possibilities:, (1), The, visual, details, of, possible, things,, states, of, affairs,, or, like, forms,, which, are, unavailable, to, perception, under, normal, circumstances, …, ., (2), Possible, objects,, events, or, life, forms, from, or, existing, in, alternative, possible, physical, and, perceptual, environments, to, our, own., (3), Configurations, arising, from, radical, modes, of, schematizing,, decomposing, or, recomposing, material, bodies, or, states, of, affairs., (4), Possible, visual, traces, of, an, item’s, or, state, of, affairs’, past,, future, or, counterfactual, appearances, or, positions., (148), From, this, logically, given, set, of, possibilities,, Crowther, then, derives, (again, without, argument), the, kinds, of, abstract, pictorial, styles, that, these, possibilities, analytically, generate,, and, these, (don’t, you, know, it), turn, out, to, more, or, less, range, over, the, history, of, abstract, art, in, the, twentieth, century., He, ends, the, chapter, by, claiming, he, has, provided, a, theory, of, meaning, for, abstract, art, (even, though, nothing, about, actual, content, is, specified, in, what, he, has, putatively, done)., There, is, a, certain, obsessive, elegance, in, his, position., However,, it, is, not, difficult, to, imagine, other, ways,, beyond, Crowther’s, canonical, four,, in, which, abstract, picturing, is, possible., For, example,, consider, a, possible, schema, for, the, abstract, picturing, of, human, moods,, another, (or, is, it, the, same?), for, poetic, correspondences,, another, for, sublimity,, etc., Crowther, could, retort, that, these, modes, of, picturing, fall, under, (or, are, derivatives, from), his, list, of, 1-4., But, I, think, he, could, only, assert, this, on, pain, of, making, each, of, his, propositions, so, vague, as, to, encompass, everything, at, the, price, of, saying, little, or, nothing., Earlier, in, the, book, Crowther, argues, that, the, fundamental, categories, of, art, history, encompass, form,, history, and, psychology,, but, his, elaboration, refuses, ideology,, society, and, economy, for, no, particular, reason, that, I, can, find,, beyond, his, own, explanatory, preferences., It, is, an, odd, sin, of, omission, given, that, the, field, of, art, history, has, (as, he, knows, well), been, highly, preoccupied, with, demonstrating, the, importance, of, ideology,, gender, and, the, like, for, pictorial, forms., What, is, right, and, indeed, excellent, in, Crowther’s, work, is, the, return, to, the, thought, that, forms, as, general, as, perspective, cannot, be, reducible, to, ideological, analysis,, and, that, such, forms, do, cry, out, to, be, understood, along, the, lines, of, linguistic, schemes,, even, if, these, analogies, might, not, go, the, whole, distance., However,, it, is, not, right, to, exclude, economy,, ideology, and, society, without, at, least, a, serious, exploration, of, what, is, at, stake, in, style, formation, (especially, while, including, psychology, and, history)., What, one, misses, in, this, book, is, the, philosophy:, the, hard, questioning, of, linguistic, analogies,, the, hard, thought, about, what, counts, as, a, style, formation, and, its, analytic, reconstruction., One, has, the, feeling, Crowther, had, already, made, up, his, mind, before, writing, the, book,, and, that, he, is, simply, informing, the, reader, of, his, opinions., About, twenty, five, years, ago, Kendall, Walton, wrote, a, paper, called, “Categories, of, Art”,, which, argued, that, categories, of, art, arise, and, change, in, accord, with, temperaments, of, interpretation, and, indeed,, new, art-making., For, this, (and, other), reasons,, such, categories, are, contingent, and, provisional—Aristotelian, if, you, will., Some, categories, are, far, more, central, than, others;, others, are, perhaps, essential, (for, this, or, that)., But, (and, here, is, the, Wittgensteinian, element), all, are, revisable,, insofar, as, their, scope,, and, their, place, in, a, system, or, relationship, with, others, can, shift., Crowther, says, in, passing, that, to, understand, a, category, is, to, understand, it, against, the, fabric, of, comparative, categories,, but, little, is, made, of, the, remark., Its, implications, are,, in, my, view,, vast., The, concept, of, perspective, shifts, with, Michelangelo, and, mannerism,, it, shifts, against, German, expressionism, and, abstraction,, and, it, shifts, as, concepts, of, theory, in, relationship, to, practice, shift., The, category, also, shifts, as, formal, invention, becomes, increasingly, recognized, as, an, activity, that, takes, shape, in, contexts, of, power, and, economy., The, significance, of, these, shifts, is, debatable., To, mark, a, style, is, not, to, mark, a, system, of, determinate, relationships, between, a, fixed, and, complete, number, of, categories, (this, precludes, the, crucial, facts, of, revision, and, dissensus);, it, is,, rather,, to, present, a, holistic, representation, which, is, always, liable, to, change., A, failure, of, Crowther’s, book, more, than, superficially, related, to, his, puristic,, reconstructive, style,, is, its, near, total, absence, of, reference, to, about, twenty-five, years, of, debate, in, aesthetics,, art, history, and, art, criticism, (not, to, mention, the, philosophy, of, language, and, linguistics), about, style,, art,, syntax, and, semantics., He, writes, against, the, ghosts, of, the, 19th, century,, and, this, places, him,, curiously,, in, an, anachronistic, vacuum,, even, if, it, has, the, benefit, of, allowing, him, to, pinpoint, some, of, the, ongoing, importance, of, these, great, art, historians, from, the, past., About, Recent, Reviews, Review, Archive, Editorial, Board, Reviewer’s, Guidelines, Free,
