often, have, dead, lawns, and, may, be, poorly, maintained., Real, estate, owned, or, REO, is, a, term, used, in, the, United, States, to, describe, a, class, of, property, owned, by, a, lender—typically, a, bank,, government, agency,, or, government, loan, insurer—after, an, unsuccessful, sale, at, a, foreclosure, auction.[1], A, foreclosing, beneficiary, will, typically, set, the, opening, bid, at, a, foreclosure, auction, for, at, least, the, outstanding, loan, amount., If, there, are, no, bidders, that, are, interested,, then, the, beneficiary, will, legally, repossess, the, property., This, is, commonly, the, case, when, the, amount, owed, on, the, home, is, higher, than, the, current, market, value, of, this, foreclosure, property,, such, as, with, a, high, loan-to-value, mortgage, following, a, real, estate, bubble., As, soon, as, the, beneficiary, repossesses, the, property, it, is, listed, on, their, books, as, REO, and, categorized, as, an, asset., (See, non-performing, asset)., Contents, 1, Origin, 2, Process, 3, Property, preservation, 4, Bulk, real, estate, owned, 5, References, Origin[edit], The, term, REO, originates, from, the, term, other, real, estate, owned, (OREO),, which, is, used, on, financial, statements, to, classify, real, estate, property, owned, by, a, financial, institution, but, which, is, not, directly, related, to, its, business., These, financial, institutions, are, often, the, lender., Lenders, are, primarily, in, the, business, of, making, loans, with, the, intent, that, nearly, all, of, those, loans, will, be, repaid, in, full, with, interest., Seizing,, managing, and, reselling, real, property, collateral, to, recover, unpaid, loan, balances, is, secondary, to, lenders', primary, line, of, business., Property, management, companies,, for, whom, real, estate, management, is, their, primary, business,, use, the, term, OREO., In, balance, sheet, terms,, OREO, assets, are, considered, non-earning, assets, for, purposes, of, regulatory, accounting.[2], In, the, context, of, national, banks, in, the, U.S.,, the, term, OREO, is, legally, defined, by, the, Office, of, the, Comptroller, of, the, Currency, in, regulations, promulgated, pursuant, to, 12, U.S.C. § 29,, specifically, in, 12, C.F.R., 34, and, 12, C.F.R., 160.30.[3], Process[edit], As, soon, as, a, property, goes, into, a, distressed, status, (the, borrower/home, owner, misses, mortgage, payments), the, beneficiary, will, want, to, determine, the, amount, of, equity, that, the, property, has., A, popular, method, to, determine, the, equity, is, to, obtain, a, Broker's, Price, Opinion, (BPO), or, order, an, appraisal., Based, on, the, amount, of, equity, that, is, determined, from, the, BPO,, the, bank, will, decide, whether, to, allow, a, short, sale, (if, requested, by, the, homeowner)., If, no, short, sale, is, requested, by, the, home, owner,, the, beneficiary, will, continue, the, foreclosure, process., If, the, beneficiary, is, unable, to, sell, the, property, through, a, short, sale, or, at, a, foreclosure, auction, it, will, now, become, an, REO, property., After, a, repossession, from, which, the, property, becomes, classified, as, REO,, the, beneficiary, will, go, through, the, process, of, trying, to, sell, the, property, on, its, own, or, obtain, the, service, of, an, REO, Asset, Manager., The, beneficiary, will, remove, the, liens, and, other, debts, on, the, home, and, try, to, resell, it, to, the, public,, either, through, future, auctions,, direct, marketing, through, a, real, estate, broker,, or, by, itself., The, asset, manager, may, also, try, to, contact, REO, realtors, that, specialize, in, certain, ZIP, codes, to, help, sell, this, bank, owned, property., Real, estate, investors, will, often, purchase, these, properties, because, of, discounts, offered, to, compensate, for, the, condition, of, the, property., Many, larger, banks, and, government, institutions, have, REO/asset, management, departments, that, field, bids, and, offers,, oversee, up, keep,, and, handle, sales., Some, REO, properties, on, the, open, market, will, be, listed, in, MLS, by, the, broker, who, performed, the, BPO.[citation, needed], Property, preservation[edit], Bank, REO, properties, are, generally, in, poor, condition, and, need, repairs, and, maintenance,, both, to, satisfy, property, upkeep, laws, and, to, preserve, and, prepare, the, property, for, sale., Maintenance, is, generally, the, responsibility, of, the, mortgage, servicer[4][5], and, is, often, in, turn, provided, by, a, specialized, property, preservation, company., These, property, preservation, services, include:, securing, a, property, (changing, locks,, boarding, up),, debris, removal,, property, maintenance, (winterizing,, cutting, grass,, repairing, or, tarping, roof, leaks),, and, rehabilitation.[4][6], In, addition, to, preventing, damage, to, the, property,, securing, a, property, is, used, to, prevent, or, discourage, re-entry, by, former, occupants, or, by, squatters,, which, can, both, damage, the, property, and, require, legal, proceedings, to, remove,, further, complicating, a, sale., Swimming, pools, must, also, be, secured, to, prevent, deaths, or, injuries, from, drowning, and, falls., Bulk, real, estate, owned[edit], Bulk, REO, or, bulk, real, estate, owned,, from, a, real, estate, investor’s, point, of, view,, is, like, investing, on, wholesale, real, estate, properties., On, the, other, hand,, banks, or, lenders, sell, or, open, their, assets, in, group, for, auction, at, a, very, low, price, compared, to, their, market, value., [7][8], References[edit], ^, William, Roark, (2006),, Concise, Encyclopedia, of, Real, Estate, Business,
