[Closing, (real, estate), From, Wikipedia,, the, free, encyclopedia, Jump, to:, navigation,, search, This, article, does, not, cite, any, sources., Please, help, improve, this, article, by, adding, citations, to, reliable, sources., Unsourced, material, may, be, challenged, and, removed., (December, 2009), (Learn, how, and, when, to, remove, this, template, message), Closing, (also, referred, to, as, completion, or, settlement), is, the, final, step, in, executing, a, real, estate, transaction., The, closing, date, is, set, during, the, negotiation, phase,, and, is, usually, several, weeks, after, the, offer, is, formally, accepted., On, the, closing, date,, the, ownership, of, the, property, is, transferred, to, the, buyer., In, most, jurisdictions,, ownership, is, officially, transferred, when, a, deed, from, the, seller, is, delivered, to, the, buyer., Lenders, providing, a, mortgage, loan, will, often, require, title, service,, including, title, search, and, title, insurance,, appraisal,, land, survey,, and, attorneys, to, be, involved., Several, things, happen, during, closing:, The, buyer, and/or, his/her, lender, delivers, a, cheque, (generally, in, the, US,, a, cashier's, check, or, wire, transfer), for, the, balance, owed, on, the, purchase, price., The, seller, signs, the, deed, over, to, the, buyer, and, gives, it, to, the, buyer., A, recorder's, office, which, would, record, the, deed, commonly, requires, the, seller's, signature, to, be, notarized., If, applicable,, a, mortgage, will, also, be, recorded., In, jurisdictions, that, use, the, Torrens, title, system,, such, as, New, Zealand, and, Australia,, this, step, involves, the, lodging, of, a, transfer, instrument, with, the, relevant, Registrar., Commonly,, the, seller, delivers, possession, to, the, buyer,, typically, by, giving, the, buyer, keys, for, any, buildings, or, apartment., Unless, otherwise, specified, in, the, real, estate, contract,, delivery, of, possession, should, be, at, the, closing., A, title, company,, lawyer,, notary,, or, the, buyer, registers, the, new, deed, with, the, local, land, registry, office, or, recorder's, office., A, declaration, or, statement, by, the, buyer, or, seller, regarding, the, purchase, price, may, have, to, be, filed, with, the, government., Conveyancing, taxes, and, recorder's, fee, will, typically, have, to, be, paid,, which, are, part, of, the, closing, costs., The, seller, receives, a, cheque, or, bank, transfer, for, the, proceeds, of, the, sale,, less, closing, costs, and, mortgage, payouts., From, the, funds, allotted, for, closing, costs,, prepayments, for, real, estate, taxes, and, insurance, may, be, required,, and, fees, charged, by, other, parties, may, be, paid,, such, as, real, estate, brokers/agents,, title, companies,, lawyers,, etc., In, some, states,, closing, in, escrow, may, occur., In, this, process,, a, title, company, or, other, trusted, party, holds, the, money, and, the, signed, deed,, and, arranges, for, the, transfer., This, is, primarily, so, that, the, seller, can, give, up, ownership, of, the, property,, and, the, buyer, can, hand, over, the, payment,, without, both, parties, having, to, be, present, at, the, closing, at, the, same, time., Escrow, ensures, an, orderly, transaction,, or, if, something, goes, wrong,, an, orderly, termination, of, the, agreement., In, other, states,, a, process, called, settlement, takes, place, on, a, specified, date, and, time, during, which, all, parties, (usually, including, the, agents, involved), meet, at, a, settlement, company,, and, which, is, presided, over, or, supervised, by, a, lawyer, or, settlement, agent., At, that, time,, the, settlement, agent, disburses, all, funds, listed, on, the, settlement, statement, (in, form, of, certified, or, wired, funds), and, the, property, conveyance, takes, place,, and, the, deed, is, then, recorded, by, the, settlement, company., A, reference, to, completion, is, in, effect, the, same, as, closing, and, takes, its, name, from, the, contract, to, convey, property, having, been, completed, once, the, balance, owed, on, the, purchase, price, has, been, paid, to, the, seller, and, title, transferred, to, the, buyer., See, also[edit], Closing, (sales), List, of, real, estate, topics, v, t, e, Real, estate, Property, Tertiary, sector, of, the,
