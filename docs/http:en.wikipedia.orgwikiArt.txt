[Art, From, Wikipedia,, the, free, encyclopedia, Jump, to:, navigation,, search, This, article, is, about, the, general, concept, of, art., For, the, group, of, creative, disciplines,, see, The, arts., For, other, uses,, see, Art, (disambiguation)., Clockwise, from, upper, left:, a, self-portrait, by, Vincent, van, Gogh;, a, female, ancestor, figure, by, a, Chokwe, artist;, detail, from, The, Birth, of, Venus, by, Sandro, Botticelli;, and, an, Okinawan, Shisa, lion., Art, is, a, diverse, range, of, human, activities, in, creating, visual,, auditory, or, performing, artifacts, (artworks),, expressing, the, author's, imaginative, or, technical, skill,, intended, to, be, appreciated, for, their, beauty, or, emotional, power.[1][2], In, their, most, general, form, these, activities, include, the, production, of, works, of, art,, the, criticism, of, art,, the, study, of, the, history, of, art,, and, the, aesthetic, dissemination, of, art., The, oldest, documented, forms, of, art, are, visual, arts,, which, include, creation, of, images, or, objects, in, fields, including, painting,, sculpture,, printmaking,, photography,, and, other, visual, media., Architecture, is, often, included, as, one, of, the, visual, arts;, however,, like, the, decorative, arts,, or, advertising,[3], it, involves, the, creation, of, objects, where, the, practical, considerations, of, use, are, essential—in, a, way, that, they, usually, are, not, in, a, painting,, for, example., Music,, theatre,, film,, dance,, and, other, performing, arts,, as, well, as, literature, and, other, media, such, as, interactive, media,, are, included, in, a, broader, definition, of, art, or, the, arts.[1][4], Until, the, 17th, century,, art, referred, to, any, skill, or, mastery, and, was, not, differentiated, from, crafts, or, sciences., In, modern, usage, after, the, 17th, century,, where, aesthetic, considerations, are, paramount,, the, fine, arts, are, separated, and, distinguished, from, acquired, skills, in, general,, such, as, the, decorative, or, applied, arts., Art, may, be, characterized, in, terms, of, mimesis, (its, representation, of, reality),, expression,, communication, of, emotion,, or, other, qualities., During, the, Romantic, period,, art, came, to, be, seen, as, "a, special, faculty, of, the, human, mind, to, be, classified, with, religion, and, science".[5], Though, the, definition, of, what, constitutes, art, is, disputed[6][7][8], and, has, changed, over, time,, general, descriptions, mention, an, idea, of, imaginative, or, technical, skill, stemming, from, human, agency[9], and, creation.[10], The, nature, of, art,, and, related, concepts, such, as, creativity, and, interpretation,, are, explored, in, a, branch, of, philosophy, known, as, aesthetics.[11], Contents, 1, Creative, art, and, fine, art, 2, History, 3, Forms,, genres,, media,, and, styles, 3.1, Skill, and, craft, 4, Purpose, 4.1, Non-motivated, functions, 4.2,

Ximeng., In, the, perspective, of, the, history, of, art,[10], artistic, works, have, existed, for, almost, as, long, as, humankind:, from, early, pre-historic, art, to, contemporary, art;, however,, some, theories, restrict, the, concept, of, "artistic, works", to, modern, Western, societies.[12], One, early, sense, of, the, definition, of, art, is, closely, related, to, the, older, Latin, meaning,, which, roughly, translates, to, "skill", or, "craft,", as, associated, with, words, such, as, "artisan.", English, words, derived, from, this, meaning, include, artifact,, artificial,, artifice,, medical, arts,, and, military, arts., However,, there, are, many, other, colloquial, uses, of, the, word,, all, with, some, relation, to, its, etymology., 20th-century, Rwandan, bottle., Artistic, works, may, serve, practical, functions,, in, addition, to, their, decorative, value., Few, modern, scholars, have, been, more, divided, than, Plato, and, Aristotle, on, the, question, concerning, the, importance, of, art,, with, Aristotle, strongly, supporting, art, in, general, and, Plato, generally, being, opposed, to, its, relative, importance., Several, dialogues, in, Plato, tackle, questions, about, art:, Socrates, says, that, poetry, is, inspired, by, the, muses,, and, is, not, rational., He, speaks, approvingly, of, this,, and, other, forms, of, divine, madness, (drunkenness,, eroticism,, and, dreaming), in, the, Phaedrus, (265a–c),, and, yet, in, the, Republic, wants, to, outlaw, Homer's, great, poetic, art,, and, laughter, as, well., In, Ion,, Socrates, gives, no, hint, of, the, disapproval, of, Homer, that, he, expresses, in, the, Republic., The, dialogue, Ion, suggests, that, Homer's, Iliad, functioned, in, the, ancient, Greek, world, as, the, Bible, does, today, in, the, modern, Christian, world:, as, divinely, inspired, literary, art, that, can, provide, moral, guidance,, if, only, it, can, be, properly, interpreted., With, regards, to, the, literary, art, and, the, musical, arts,, Aristotle, considered, epic, poetry,, tragedy,, comedy,, dithyrambic, poetry, and, music, to, be, mimetic, or, imitative, art,, each, varying, in, imitation, by, medium,, object,, and, manner.[13], For, example,, music, imitates, with, the, media, of, rhythm, and, harmony,, whereas, dance, imitates, with, rhythm, alone,, and, poetry, with, language., The, forms, also, differ, in, their, object, of, imitation., Comedy,, for, instance,, is, a, dramatic, imitation, of, men, worse, than, average;, whereas, tragedy, imitates, men, slightly, better, than, average., Lastly,, the, forms, differ, in, their, manner, of, imitation—through, narrative, or, character,, through, change, or, no, change,, and, through, drama, or, no, drama.[14], Aristotle, believed, that, imitation, is, natural, to, mankind, and, constitutes, one, of, mankind's, advantages, over, animals.[15], The, second,, and, more, recent,, sense, of, the, word, art, as, an, abbreviation, for, creative, art, or, fine, art, emerged, in, the, early, 17th, century.[16], Fine, art, refers, to, a, skill, used, to, express, the, artist's, creativity,, or, to, engage, the, audience's, aesthetic, sensibilities,, or, to, draw, the, audience, towards, consideration, of, more, refined, or, finer, work, of, art., Within, this, latter, sense,, the, word, art, may, refer, to, several, things:, (i), a, study, of, a, creative, skill,, (ii), a, process, of, using, the, creative, skill,, (iii), a, product, of, the, creative, skill,, or, (iv), the, audience's, experience, with, the, creative, skill., The, creative, arts, (art, as, discipline), are, a, collection, of, disciplines, which, produce, artworks, (art, as, objects), that, are, compelled, by, a, personal, drive, (art, as, activity), and, convey, a, message,, mood,, or, symbolism, for, the, perceiver, to, interpret, (art, as, experience)., Art, is, something, that, stimulates, an, individual's, thoughts,, emotions,, beliefs,, or, ideas, through, the, senses., Works, of, art, can, be, explicitly, made, for, this, purpose, or, interpreted, on, the, basis, of, images, or, objects., For, some, scholars,, such, as, Kant,, the, sciences, and, the, arts, could, be, distinguished, by, taking, science, as, representing, the, domain, of, knowledge, and, the, arts, as, representing, the, domain, of, the, freedom, of, artistic, expression., Often,, if, the, skill, is, being, used, in, a, common, or, practical, way,, people, will, consider, it, a, craft, instead, of, art., Likewise,, if, the, skill, is, being, used, in, a, commercial, or, industrial, way,, it, may, be, considered, commercial, art, instead, of, fine, art., On, the, other, hand,, crafts, and, design, are, sometimes, considered, applied, art., Some, art, followers, have, argued, that, the, difference, between, fine, art, and, applied, art, has, more, to, do, with, value, judgments, made, about, the, art, than, any, clear, definitional, difference.[17], However,, even, fine, art, often, has, goals, beyond, pure, creativity, and, self-expression., The, purpose, of, works, of, art, may, be, to, communicate, ideas,, such, as, in, politically,, spiritually,, or, philosophically, motivated, art;, to, create, a, sense, of, beauty, (see, aesthetics);, to, explore, the, nature, of, perception;, for, pleasure;, or, to, generate, strong, emotions., The, purpose, may, also, be, seemingly, nonexistent., The, nature, of, art, has, been, described, by, philosopher, Richard, Wollheim, as, "one, of, the, most, elusive, of, the, traditional, problems, of, human, culture".[18], Art, has, been, defined, as, a, vehicle, for, the, expression, or, communication, of, emotions, and, ideas,, a, means, for, exploring, and, appreciating, formal, elements, for, their, own, sake,, and, as, mimesis, or, representation., Art, as, mimesis, has, deep, roots, in, the, philosophy, of, Aristotle.[19], Leo, Tolstoy, identified, art, as, a, use, of, indirect, means, to, communicate, from, one, person, to, another.[19], Benedetto, Croce, and, R.G., Collingwood, advanced, the, idealist, view, that, art, expresses, emotions,, and, that, the, work, of, art, therefore, essentially, exists, in, the, mind, of, the, creator.[20][21], The, theory, of, art, as, form, has, its, roots, in, the, philosophy, of, Immanuel, Kant,, and, was, developed, in, the, early, twentieth, century, by, Roger, Fry, and, Clive, Bell., More, recently,, thinkers, influenced, by, Martin, Heidegger, have, interpreted, art, as, the, means, by, which, a, community, develops, for, itself, a, medium, for, self-expression, and, interpretation.[22], George, Dickie, has, offered, an, institutional, theory, of, art, that, defines, a, work, of, art, as, any, artifact, upon, which, a, qualified, person, or, persons, acting, on, behalf, of, the, social, institution, commonly, referred, to, as, "the, art, world", has, conferred, "the, status, of, candidate, for, appreciation".[23], Larry, Shiner, has, described, fine, art, as, "not, an, essence, or, a, fate, but, something, we, have, made., Art, as, we, have, generally, understood, it, is, a, European, invention, barely, two, hundred, years, old."[24], History, Main, article:, History, of, art, Venus, of, Willendorf,, circa, 24,000–22,000 BP, Sculptures,, cave, paintings,, rock, paintings, and, petroglyphs, from, the, Upper, Paleolithic, dating, to, roughly, 40,000, years, ago, have, been, found,[25], but, the, precise, meaning, of, such, art, is, often, disputed, because, so, little, is, known, about, the, cultures, that, produced, them., The, oldest, art, objects, in, the, world—a, series, of, tiny,, drilled, snail, shells, about, 75,000, years, old—were, discovered, in, a, South, African, cave.[26], Containers, that, may, have, been, used, to, hold, paints, have, been, found, dating, as, far, back, as, 100,000, years.[27], Etched, shells, by, Homo, erectus, from, 430,000, and, 540,000, years, ago, were, discovered, in, 2014.[28], Cave, painting, of, a, horse, from, the, Lascaux, caves,, circa, 16,000 BP, Many, great, traditions, in, art, have, a, foundation, in, the, art, of, one, of, the, great, ancient, civilizations:, Ancient, Egypt,, Mesopotamia,, Persia,, India,, China,, Ancient, Greece,, Rome,, as, well, as, Inca,, Maya,, and, Olmec., Each, of, these, centers, of, early, civilization, developed, a, unique, and, characteristic, style, in, its, art., Because, of, the, size, and, duration, of, these, civilizations,, more, of, their, art, works, have, survived, and, more, of, their, influence, has, been, transmitted, to, other, cultures, and, later, times., Some, also, have, provided, the, first, records, of, how, artists, worked., For, example,, this, period, of, Greek, art, saw, a, veneration, of, the, human, physical, form, and, the, development, of, equivalent, skills, to, show, musculature,, poise,, beauty,, and, anatomically, correct, proportions., In, Byzantine, and, Medieval, art, of, the, Western, Middle, Ages,, much, art, focused, on, the, expression, of, subjects, about, Biblical, and, religious, culture,, and, used, styles, that, showed, the, higher, glory, of, a, heavenly, world,, such, as, the, use, of, gold, in, the, background, of, paintings,, or, glass, in, mosaics, or, windows,, which, also, presented, figures, in, idealized,, patterned, (flat), forms., Nevertheless,, a, classical, realist, tradition, persisted, in, small, Byzantine, works,, and, realism, steadily, grew, in, the, art, of, Catholic, Europe., Renaissance, art, had, a, greatly, increased, emphasis, on, the, realistic, depiction, of, the, material, world,, and, the, place, of, humans, in, it,, reflected, in, the, corporeality, of, the, human, body,, and, development, of, a, systematic, method, of, graphical, perspective, to, depict, recession, in, a, three-dimensional, picture, space., The, stylized, signature, of, Sultan, Mahmud, II, of, the, Ottoman, Empire, was, written, in, Islamic, calligraphy., It, reads, Mahmud, Khan, son, of, Abdulhamid, is, forever, victorious., The, Great, Mosque, of, Kairouan, in, Tunisia,, also, called, the, Mosque, of, Uqba,, is, one, of, the, finest,, most, significant, and, best, preserved, artistic, and, architectural, examples, of, early, great, mosques., Dated, in, its, present, state, from, the, 9th, century,, it, is, the, ancestor, and, model, of, all, the, mosques, in, the, western, Islamic, lands.[29], In, the, east,, Islamic, art's, rejection, of, iconography, led, to, emphasis, on, geometric, patterns,, calligraphy,, and, architecture., Further, east,, religion, dominated, artistic, styles, and, forms, too., India, and, Tibet, saw, emphasis, on, painted, sculptures, and, dance,, while, religious, painting, borrowed, many, conventions, from, sculpture, and, tended, to, bright, contrasting, colors, with, emphasis, on, outlines., China, saw, the, flourishing, of, many, art, forms:, jade, carving,, bronzework,, pottery, (including, the, stunning, terracotta, army, of, Emperor, Qin),, poetry,, calligraphy,, music,, painting,, drama,, fiction,, etc., Chinese, styles, vary, greatly, from, era, to, era, and, each, one, is, traditionally, named, after, the, ruling, dynasty., So,, for, example,, Tang, dynasty, paintings, are, monochromatic, and, sparse,, emphasizing, idealized, landscapes,, but, Ming, Dynasty, paintings, are, busy, and, colorful,, and, focus, on, telling, stories, via, setting, and, composition., Japan, names, its, styles, after, imperial, dynasties, too,, and, also, saw, much, interplay, between, the, styles, of, calligraphy, and, painting., Woodblock, printing, became, important, in, Japan, after, the, 17th, century., Painting, by, Song, dynasty, artist, Ma, Lin,, circa, 1250., 24.8 ×, 25.2 cm, The, western, Age, of, Enlightenment, in, the, 18th, century, saw, artistic, depictions, of, physical, and, rational, certainties, of, the, clockwork, universe,, as, well, as, politically, revolutionary, visions, of, a, post-monarchist, world,, such, as, Blake's, portrayal, of, Newton, as, a, divine, geometer,, or, David's, propagandistic, paintings., This, led, to, Romantic, rejections, of, this, in, favor, of, pictures, of, the, emotional, side, and, individuality, of, humans,, exemplified, in, the, novels, of, Goethe., The, late, 19th, century, then, saw, a, host, of, artistic, movements,, such, as, academic, art,, Symbolism,, impressionism, and, fauvism, among, others., The, history, of, twentieth-century, art, is, a, narrative, of, endless, possibilities, and, the, search, for, new, standards,, each, being, torn, down, in, succession, by, the, next., Thus, the, parameters, of, impressionism,, Expressionism,, Fauvism,, Cubism,, Dadaism,, Surrealism,, etc., cannot, be, maintained, very, much, beyond, the, time, of, their, invention., Increasing, global, interaction, during, this, time, saw, an, equivalent, influence, of, other, cultures, into, Western, art., Thus,, Japanese, woodblock, prints, (themselves, influenced, by, Western, Renaissance, draftsmanship), had, an, immense, influence, on, impressionism, and, subsequent, development., Later,, African, sculptures, were, taken, up, by, Picasso, and, to, some, extent, by, Matisse., Similarly,, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, the, West, has, had, huge, impacts, on, Eastern, art, with, originally, western, ideas, like, Communism, and, Post-Modernism, exerting, a, powerful, influence., Modernism,, the, idealistic, search, for, truth,, gave, way, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, to, a, realization, of, its, unattainability., Theodor, W., Adorno, said, in, 1970,, "It, is, now, taken, for, granted, that, nothing, which, concerns, art, can, be, taken, for, granted, any, more:, neither, art, itself,, nor, art, in, relationship, to, the, whole,, nor, even, the, right, of, art, to, exist."[30], Relativism, was, accepted, as, an, unavoidable, truth,, which, led, to, the, period, of, contemporary, art, and, postmodern, criticism,, where, cultures, of, the, world, and, of, history, are, seen, as, changing, forms,, which, can, be, appreciated, and, drawn, from, only, with, skepticism, and, irony., Furthermore,, the, separation, of, cultures, is, increasingly, blurred, and, some, argue, it, is, now, more, appropriate, to, think, in, terms, of, a, global, culture,, rather, than, of, regional, ones., Forms,, genres,, media,, and, styles, Napoleon, I, on, his, Imperial, Throne, by, Ingres, (French,, 1806),, oil, on, canvas, Main, article:, The, arts, The, creative, arts, are, often, divided, into, more, specific, categories,, typically, along, perceptually, distinguishable, categories, such, as, media,, genre,, styles,, and, form.[31], Art, form, refers, to, the, elements, of, art, that, are, independent, of, its, interpretation, or, significance., It, covers, the, methods, adopted, by, the, artist, and, the, physical, composition, of, the, artwork,, primarily, non-semantic, aspects, of, the, work, (i.e.,, figurae),[32], such, as, color,, contour,, dimension,, medium,, melody,, space,, texture,, and, value., Form, may, also, include, visual, design, principles,, such, as, arrangement,, balance,, contrast,, emphasis,, harmony,, proportion,, proximity,, and, rhythm.[33], In, general, there, are, three, schools, of, philosophy, regarding, art,, focusing, respectively, on, form,, content,, and, context.[33], Extreme, Formalism, is, the, view, that, all, aesthetic, properties, of, art, are, formal, (that, is,, part, of, the, art, form)., Philosophers, almost, universally, reject, this, view, and, hold, that, the, properties, and, aesthetics, of, art, extend, beyond, materials,, techniques,, and, form.[34], Unfortunately,, there, is, little, consensus, on, terminology, for, these, informal, properties., Some, authors, refer, to, subject, matter, and, content, -, i.e.,, denotations, and, connotations, -, while, others, prefer, terms, like, meaning, and, significance.[33], Extreme, Intentionalism, holds, that, authorial, intent, plays, a, decisive, role, in, the, meaning, of, a, work, of, art,, conveying, the, content, or, essential, main, idea,, while, all, other, interpretations, can, be, discarded.[35], It, defines, the, subject, as, the, persons, or, idea, represented,[36], and, the, content, as, the, artist's, experience, of, that, subject.[37], For, example,, the, composition, of, Napoleon, I, on, his, Imperial, Throne, is, partly, borrowed, from, the, Statue, of, Zeus, at, Olympia., As, evidenced, by, the, title,, the, subject, is, Napoleon,, and, the, content, is, Ingres's, representation, of, Napoleon, as, "Emperor-God, beyond, time, and, space".[33], Similarly, to, extreme, formalism,, philosophers, typically, reject, extreme, intentionalism,, because, art, may, have, multiple, ambiguous, meanings, and, authorial, intent, may, be, unknowable, and, thus, irrelevant., Its, restrictive, interpretation, is, "socially, unhealthy,, philosophically, unreal,, and, politically, unwise".[33], Finally,, the, developing, theory, of, post-structuralism, studies, art's, significance, in, a, cultural, context,, such, as, the, ideas,, emotions,, and, reactions, prompted, by, a, work.[38], The, cultural, context, often, reduces, to, the, artist's, techniques, and, intentions,, in, which, case, analysis, proceeds, along, lines, similar, to, formalism, and, intentionalism., However,, in, other, cases, historical, and, material, conditions, may, predominate,, such, as, religious, and, philosophical, convictions,, sociopolitical, and, economic, structures,, or, even, climate, and, geography., Art, criticism, continues, to, grow, and, develop, alongside, art.[33], Skill, and, craft, Adam., Detail, from, Michelangelo's, fresco, in, the, Sistine, Chapel, (1511), Detail, of, Leonardo, da, Vinci's, Mona, Lisa,, showing, the, painting, technique, of, sfumato, See, also:, Conceptual, Art, and, Artistic, Skill, Art, can, connote, a, sense, of, trained, ability, or, mastery, of, a, medium., Art, can, also, simply, refer, to, the, developed, and, efficient, use, of, a, language, to, convey, meaning, with, immediacy, and, or, depth., Art, can, be, defined, as, an, act, of, expressing, feelings,, thoughts,, and, observations.[39], There, is, an, understanding, that, is, reached, with, the, material, as, a, result, of, handling, it,, which, facilitates, one's, thought, processes., A, common, view, is, that, the, epithet, "art",, particular, in, its, elevated, sense,, requires, a, certain, level, of, creative, expertise, by, the, artist,, whether, this, be, a, demonstration, of, technical, ability,, an, originality, in, stylistic, approach,, or, a, combination, of, these, two., Traditionally, skill, of, execution, was, viewed, as, a, quality, inseparable, from, art, and, thus, necessary, for, its, success;, for, Leonardo, da, Vinci,, art,, neither, more, nor, less, than, his, other, endeavors,, was, a, manifestation, of, skill., Rembrandt's, work,, now, praised, for, its, ephemeral, virtues,, was, most, admired, by, his, contemporaries, for, its, virtuosity., At, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century,, the, adroit, performances, of, John, Singer, Sargent, were, alternately, admired, and, viewed, with, skepticism, for, their, manual, fluency,, yet, at, nearly, the, same, time, the, artist, who, would, become, the, era's, most, recognized, and, peripatetic, iconoclast,, Pablo, Picasso,, was, completing, a, traditional, academic, training, at, which, he, excelled., A, common, contemporary, criticism, of, some, modern, art, occurs, along, the, lines, of, objecting, to, the, apparent, lack, of, skill, or, ability, required, in, the, production, of, the, artistic, object., In, conceptual, art,, Marcel, Duchamp's, "Fountain", is, among, the, first, examples, of, pieces, wherein, the, artist, used, found, objects, ("ready-made"), and, exercised, no, traditionally, recognised, set, of, skills., Tracey, Emin's, My, Bed,, or, Damien, Hirst's, The, Physical, Impossibility, of, Death, in, the, Mind, of, Someone, Living, follow, this, example, and, also, manipulate, the, mass, media., Emin, slept, (and, engaged, in, other, activities), in, her, bed, before, placing, the, result, in, a, gallery, as, work, of, art., Hirst, came, up, with, the, conceptual, design, for, the, artwork, but, has, left, most, of, the, eventual, creation, of, many, works, to, employed, artisans., Hirst's, celebrity, is, founded, entirely, on, his, ability, to, produce, shocking, concepts., The, actual, production, in, many, conceptual, and, contemporary, works, of, art, is, a, matter, of, assembly, of, found, objects., However,, there, are, many, modernist, and, contemporary, artists, who, continue, to, excel, in, the, skills, of, drawing, and, painting, and, in, creating, hands-on, works, of, art., Purpose, A, Navajo, rug, made, circa, 1880, Mozarabic, Beatus, miniature., Spain,, late, 10th, century, Art, has, had, a, great, number, of, different, functions, throughout, its, history,, making, its, purpose, difficult, to, abstract, or, quantify, to, any, single, concept., This, does, not, imply, that, the, purpose, of, Art, is, "vague",, but, that, it, has, had, many, unique,, different, reasons, for, being, created., Some, of, these, functions, of, Art, are, provided, in, the, following, outline., The, different, purposes, of, art, may, be, grouped, according, to, those, that, are, non-motivated,, and, those, that, are, motivated, (Lévi-Strauss)., Non-motivated, functions, The, non-motivated, purposes, of, art, are, those, that, are, integral, to, being, human,, transcend, the, individual,, or, do, not, fulfill, a, specific, external, purpose., In, this, sense,, Art,, as, creativity,, is, something, humans, must, do, by, their, very, nature, (i.e., no, other, species, creates, art),, and, is, therefore, beyond, utility., Basic, human, instinct, for, harmony,, balance,, rhythm., Art, at, this, level, is, not, an, action, or, an, object,, but, an, internal, appreciation, of, balance, and, harmony, (beauty),, and, therefore, an, aspect, of, being, human, beyond, utility., "Imitation,, then,, is, one, instinct, of, our, nature., Next,, there, is, the, instinct, for, 'harmony', and, rhythm,, meters, being, manifestly, sections, of, rhythm., Persons,, therefore,, starting, with, this, natural, gift, developed, by, degrees, their, special, aptitudes,, till, their, rude, improvisations, gave, birth, to, Poetry.", -Aristotle[40], Experience, of, the, mysterious., Art, provides, a, way, to, experience, one's, self, in, relation, to, the, universe., This, experience, may, often, come, unmotivated,, as, one, appreciates, art,, music, or, poetry., "The, most, beautiful, thing, we, can, experience, is, the, mysterious., It, is, the, source, of, all, true, art, and, science.", -Albert, Einstein[41], Expression, of, the, imagination., Art, provides, a, means, to, express, the, imagination, in, non-grammatic, ways, that, are, not, tied, to, the, formality, of, spoken, or, written, language., Unlike, words,, which, come, in, sequences, and, each, of, which, have, a, definite, meaning,, art, provides, a, range, of, forms,, symbols, and, ideas, with, meanings, that, are, malleable., "Jupiter's, eagle, [as, an, example, of, art], is, not,, like, logical, (aesthetic), attributes, of, an, object,, the, concept, of, the, sublimity, and, majesty, of, creation,, but, rather, something, else—something, that, gives, the, imagination, an, incentive, to, spread, its, flight, over, a, whole, host, of, kindred, representations, that, provoke, more, thought, than, admits, of, expression, in, a, concept, determined, by, words., They, furnish, an, aesthetic, idea,, which, serves, the, above, rational, idea, as, a, substitute, for, logical, presentation,, but, with, the, proper, function,, however,, of, animating, the, mind, by, opening, out, for, it, a, prospect, into, a, field, of, kindred, representations, stretching, beyond, its, ken.", -Immanuel, Kant[42], Ritualistic, and, symbolic, functions., In, many, cultures,, art, is, used, in, rituals,, performances, and, dances, as, a, decoration, or, symbol., While, these, often, have, no, specific, utilitarian, (motivated), purpose,, anthropologists, know, that, they, often, serve, a, purpose, at, the, level, of, meaning, within, a, particular, culture., This, meaning, is, not, furnished, by, any, one, individual,, but, is, often, the, result, of, many, generations, of, change,, and, of, a, cosmological, relationship, within, the, culture., "Most, scholars, who, deal, with, rock, paintings, or, objects, recovered, from, prehistoric, contexts, that, cannot, be, explained, in, utilitarian, terms, and, are, thus, categorized, as, decorative,, ritual, or, symbolic,, are, aware, of, the, trap, posed, by, the, term, 'art'.", -Silva, Tomaskova[43], Motivated, functions, Motivated, purposes, of, art, refer, to, intentional,, conscious, actions, on, the, part, of, the, artists, or, creator., These, may, be, to, bring, about, political, change,, to, comment, on, an, aspect, of, society,, to, convey, a, specific, emotion, or, mood,, to, address, personal, psychology,, to, illustrate, another, discipline,, to, (with, commercial, arts), sell, a, product,, or, simply, as, a, form, of, communication., Communication., Art,, at, its, simplest,, is, a, form, of, communication., As, most, forms, of, communication, have, an, intent, or, goal, directed, toward, another, individual,, this, is, a, motivated, purpose., Illustrative, arts,, such, as, scientific, illustration,, are, a, form, of, art, as, communication., Maps, are, another, example., However,, the, content, need, not, be, scientific., Emotions,, moods, and, feelings, are, also, communicated, through, art., "[Art, is, a, set, of], artefacts, or, images, with, symbolic, meanings, as, a, means, of, communication.", -Steve, Mithen[44], Art, as, entertainment., Art, may, seek, to, bring, about, a, particular, emotion, or, mood,, for, the, purpose, of, relaxing, or, entertaining, the, viewer., This, is, often, the, function, of, the, art, industries, of, Motion, Pictures, and, Video, Games.[citation, needed], The, Avante-Garde., Art, for, political, change., One, of, the, defining, functions, of, early, twentieth-century, art, has, been, to, use, visual, images, to, bring, about, political, change., Art, movements, that, had, this, goal—Dadaism,, Surrealism,, Russian, constructivism,, and, Abstract, Expressionism,, among, others—are, collectively, referred, to, as, the, avante-garde, arts., "By, contrast,, the, realistic, attitude,, inspired, by, positivism,, from, Saint, Thomas, Aquinas, to, Anatole, France,, clearly, seems, to, me, to, be, hostile, to, any, intellectual, or, moral, advancement., I, loathe, it,, for, it, is, made, up, of, mediocrity,, hate,, and, dull, conceit., It, is, this, attitude, which, today, gives, birth, to, these, ridiculous, books,, these, insulting, plays., It, constantly, feeds, on, and, derives, strength, from, the, newspapers, and, stultifies, both, science, and, art, by, assiduously, flattering, the, lowest, of, tastes;, clarity, bordering, on, stupidity,, a, dog's, life.", -André, Breton, (Surrealism)[45], Art, as, a, "free, zone",, removed, from, the, action, of, the, social, censure., Unlike, the, avant-garde, movements,, which, wanted, to, erase, cultural, differences, in, order, to, produce, new, universal, values,, contemporary, art, has, enhanced, its, tolerance, towards, cultural, differences, as, well, as, its, critical, and, liberating, functions, (social, inquiry,, activism,, subversion,, deconstruction, ...),, becoming, a, more, open, place, for, research, and, experimentation.[46], Art, for, social, inquiry,, subversion, and/or, anarchy., While, similar, to, art, for, political, change,, subversive, or, deconstructivist, art, may, seek, to, question, aspects, of, society, without, any, specific, political, goal., In, this, case,, the, function, of, art, may, be, simply, to, criticize, some, aspect, of, society., Spray-paint, graffiti, on, a, wall, in, Rome, Graffiti, art, and, other, types, of, street, art, are, graphics, and, images, that, are, spray-painted, or, stencilled, on, publicly, viewable, walls,, buildings,, buses,, trains,, and, bridges,, usually, without, permission., Certain, art, forms,, such, as, graffiti,, may, also, be, illegal, when, they, break, laws, (in, this, case, vandalism)., Art, for, social, causes., Art, can, be, used, to, raise, awareness, for, a, large, variety, of, causes., A, number, of, art, activities, were, aimed, at, raising, awareness, of, autism,[47][48][49], cancer,[50][51][52], human, trafficking,[53][54], and, a, variety, of, other, topics,, such, as, ocean, conservation,[55], human, rights, in, Darfur,[56], murdered, and, missing, Aboriginal, women,[57], elder, abuse,[58], and, pollution.[59], Trashion,, using, trash, to, make, fashion,, practiced, by, artists, such, as, Marina, DeBris, is, one, example, of, using, art, to, raise, awareness, about, pollution., Art, for, psychological, and, healing, purposes., Art, is, also, used, by, art, therapists,, psychotherapists, and, clinical, psychologists, as, art, therapy., The, Diagnostic, Drawing, Series,, for, example,, is, used, to, determine, the, personality, and, emotional, functioning, of, a, patient., The, end, product, is, not, the, principal, goal, in, this, case,, but, rather, a, process, of, healing,, through, creative, acts,, is, sought., The, resultant, piece, of, artwork, may, also, offer, insight, into, the, troubles, experienced, by, the, subject, and, may, suggest, suitable, approaches, to, be, used, in, more, conventional, forms, of, psychiatric, therapy., Art, for, propaganda,, or, commercialism., Art, is, often, utilized, as, a, form, of, propaganda,, and, thus, can, be, used, to, subtly, influence, popular, conceptions, or, mood., In, a, similar, way,, art, that, tries, to, sell, a, product, also, influences, mood, and, emotion., In, both, cases,, the, purpose, of, art, here, is, to, subtly, manipulate, the, viewer, into, a, particular, emotional, or, psychological, response, toward, a, particular, idea, or, object.[60], Art, as, a, fitness, indicator., It, has, been, argued, that, the, ability, of, the, human, brain, by, far, exceeds, what, was, needed, for, survival, in, the, ancestral, environment., One, evolutionary, psychology, explanation, for, this, is, that, the, human, brain, and, associated, traits, (such, as, artistic, ability, and, creativity), are, the, human, equivalent, of, the, peacock's, tail., The, purpose, of, the, male, peacock's, extravagant, tail, has, been, argued, to, be, to, attract, females, (see, also, Fisherian, runaway, and, handicap, principle)., According, to, this, theory, superior, execution, of, art, was, evolutionary, important, because, it, attracted, mates.[61], The, functions, of, art, described, above, are, not, mutually, exclusive,, as, many, of, them, may, overlap., For, example,, art, for, the, purpose, of, entertainment, may, also, seek, to, sell, a, product,, i.e., the, movie, or, video, game., Public, access, Versailles:, Louis, Le, Vau, opened, up, the, interior, court, to, create, the, expansive, entrance, cour, d'honneur,, later, copied, all, over, Europe., Since, ancient, times,, much, of, the, finest, art, has, represented, a, deliberate, display, of, wealth, or, power,, often, achieved, by, using, massive, scale, and, expensive, materials., Much, art, has, been, commissioned, by, rulers, or, religious, establishments,, with, more, modest, versions, only, available, to, the, most, wealthy, in, society., Nevertheless,, there, have, been, many, periods, where, art, of, very, high, quality, was, available,, in, terms, of, ownership,, across, large, parts, of, society,, above, all, in, cheap, media, such, as, pottery,, which, persists, in, the, ground,, and, perishable, media, such, as, textiles, and, wood., In, many, different, cultures,, the, ceramics, of, indigenous, peoples, of, the, Americas, are, found, in, such, a, wide, range, of, graves, that, they, were, clearly, not, restricted, to, a, social, elite,, though, other, forms, of, art, may, have, been., Reproductive, methods, such, as, moulds, made, mass-production, easier,, and, were, used, to, bring, high-quality, Ancient, Roman, pottery, and, Greek, Tanagra, figurines, to, a, very, wide, market., Cylinder, seals, were, both, artistic, and, practical,, and, very, widely, used, by, what, can, be, loosely, called, the, middle, class, in, the, Ancient, Near, East., Once, coins, were, widely, used, these, also, became, an, art, form, that, reached, the, widest, range, of, society., Another, important, innovation, came, in, the, 15th, century, in, Europe,, when, printmaking, began, with, small, woodcuts,, mostly, religious,, that, were, often, very, small, and, hand-colored,, and, affordable, even, by, peasants, who, glued, them, to, the, walls, of, their, homes., Printed, books, were, initially, very, expensive,, but, fell, steadily, in, price, until, by, the, 19th, century, even, the, poorest, could, afford, some, with, printed, illustrations., Popular, prints, of, many, different, sorts, have, decorated, homes, and, other, places, for, centuries., Public, buildings, and, monuments,, secular, and, religious,, by, their, nature, normally, address, the, whole, of, society,, and, visitors, as, viewers,, and, display, to, the, general, public, has, long, been, an, important, factor, in, their, design., Egyptian, temples, are, typical, in, that, the, most, largest, and, most, lavish, decoration, was, placed, on, the, parts, that, could, be, seen, by, the, general, public,, rather, than, the, areas, seen, only, by, the, priests., Many, areas, of, royal, palaces,, castles, and, the, houses, of, the, social, elite, were, often, generally, accessible,, and, large, parts, of, the, art, collections, of, such, people, could, often, be, seen,, either, by, anybody,, or, by, those, able, to, pay, a, small, price,, or, those, wearing, the, correct, clothes,, regardless, of, who, they, were,, as, at, the, Palace, of, Versailles,, where, the, appropriate, extra, accessories, (silver, shoe, buckles, and, a, sword), could, be, hired, from, shops, outside., Special, arrangements, were, made, to, allow, the, public, to, see, many, royal, or, private, collections, placed, in, galleries,, as, with, the, Orleans, Collection, mostly, housed, in, a, wing, of, the, Palais, Royal, in, Paris,, which, could, be, visited, for, most, of, the, 18th, century., In, Italy, the, art, tourism, of, the, Grand, Tour, became, a, major, industry, from, the, Renaissance, onwards,, and, governments, and, cities, made, efforts, to, make, their, key, works, accessible., The, British, Royal, Collection, remains, distinct,, but, large, donations, such, as, the, Old, Royal, Library, were, made, from, it, to, the, British, Museum,, established, in, 1753., The, Uffizi, in, Florence, opened, entirely, as, a, gallery, in, 1765,, though, this, function, had, been, gradually, taking, the, building, over, from, the, original, civil, servants', offices, for, a, long, time, before., The, building, now, occupied, by, the, Prado, in, Madrid, was, built, before, the, French, Revolution, for, the, public, display, of, parts, of, the, royal, art, collection,, and, similar, royal, galleries, open, to, the, public, existed, in, Vienna,, Munich, and, other, capitals., The, opening, of, the, Musée, du, Louvre, during, the, French, Revolution, (in, 1793), as, a, public, museum, for, much, of, the, former, French, royal, collection, certainly, marked, an, important, stage, in, the, development, of, public, access, to, art,, transferring, ownership, to, a, republican, state,, but, was, a, continuation, of, trends, already, well, established., Most, modern, public, museums, and, art, education, programs, for, children, in, schools, can, be, traced, back, to, this, impulse, to, have, art, available, to, everyone., Museums, in, the, United, States, tend, to, be, gifts, from, the, very, rich, to, the, masses., (The, Metropolitan, Museum, of, Art, in, New, York, City,, for, example,, was, created, by, John, Taylor, Johnston,, a, railroad, executive, whose, personal, art, collection, seeded, the, museum.), But, despite, all, this,, at, least, one, of, the, important, functions, of, art, in, the, 21st, century, remains, as, a, marker, of, wealth, and, social, status., Performance, by, Joseph, Beuys,, 1978:, Everyone, an, artist, –, On, the, way, to, the, libertarian, form, of, the, social, organism, There, have, been, attempts, by, artists, to, create, art, that, can, not, be, bought, by, the, wealthy, as, a, status, object., One, of, the, prime, original, motivators, of, much, of, the, art, of, the, late, 1960s, and, 1970s, was, to, create, art, that, could, not, be, bought, and, sold., It, is, "necessary, to, present, something, more, than, mere, objects"[62], said, the, major, post, war, German, artist, Joseph, Beuys., This, time, period, saw, the, rise, of, such, things, as, performance, art,, video, art,, and, conceptual, art., The, idea, was, that, if, the, artwork, was, a, performance, that, would, leave, nothing, behind,, or, was, simply, an, idea,, it, could, not, be, bought, and, sold., "Democratic, precepts, revolving, around, the, idea, that, a, work, of, art, is, a, commodity, impelled, the, aesthetic, innovation, which, germinated, in, the, mid-1960s, and, was, reaped, throughout, the, 1970s., Artists, broadly, identified, under, the, heading, of, Conceptual, art, ..., substituting, performance, and, publishing, activities, for, engagement, with, both, the, material, and, materialistic, concerns, of, painted, or, sculptural, form, ..., [have], endeavored, to, undermine, the, art, object, qua, object."[63], In, the, decades, since,, these, ideas, have, been, somewhat, lost, as, the, art, market, has, learned, to, sell, limited, edition, DVDs, of, video, works,[64], invitations, to, exclusive, performance, art, pieces,, and, the, objects, left, over, from, conceptual, pieces., Many, of, these, performances, create, works, that, are, only, understood, by, the, elite, who, have, been, educated, as, to, why, an, idea, or, video, or, piece, of, apparent, garbage, may, be, considered, art., The, marker, of, status, becomes, understanding, the, work, instead, of, necessarily, owning, it,, and, the, artwork, remains, an, upper-class, activity., "With, the, widespread, use, of, DVD, recording, technology, in, the, early, 2000s,, artists,, and, the, gallery, system, that, derives, its, profits, from, the, sale, of, artworks,, gained, an, important, means, of, controlling, the, sale, of, video, and, computer, artworks, in, limited, editions, to, collectors."[65], Controversies, Théodore, Géricault's, Raft, of, the, Medusa,, circa, 1820, Art, has, long, been, controversial,, that, is, to, say, disliked, by, some, viewers,, for, a, wide, variety, of, reasons,, though, most, pre-modern, controversies, are, dimly, recorded,, or, completely, lost, to, a, modern, view., Iconoclasm, is, the, destruction, of, art, that, is, disliked, for, a, variety, of, reasons,, including, religious, ones., Aniconism, is, a, general, dislike, of, either, all, figurative, images,, or, often, just, religious, ones,, and, has, been, a, thread, in, many, major, religions., It, has, been, a, crucial, factor, in, the, history, of, Islamic, art,, where, depictions, of, Muhammad, remain, especially, controversial., Much, art, has, been, disliked, purely, because, it, depicted, or, otherwise, stood, for, unpopular, rulers,, parties, or, other, groups., Artistic, conventions, have, often, been, conservative, and, taken, very, seriously, by, art, critics,, though, often, much, less, so, by, a, wider, public., The, iconographic, content, of, art, could, cause, controversy,, as, with, late, medieval, depictions, of, the, new, motif, of, the, Swoon, of, the, Virgin, in, scenes, of, the, Crucifixion, of, Jesus., The, Last, Judgment, by, Michelangelo, was, controversial, for, various, reasons,, including, breaches, of, decorum, through, nudity, and, the, Apollo-like, pose, of, Christ., The, content, of, much, formal, art, through, history, was, dictated, by, the, patron, or, commissioner, rather, than, just, the, artist,, but, with, the, advent, of, Romanticism,, and, economic, changes, in, the, production, of, art,, the, artists', vision, became, the, usual, determinant, of, the, content, of, his, art,, increasing, the, incidence, of, controversies,, though, often, reducing, their, significance., Strong, incentives, for, perceived, originality, and, publicity, also, encouraged, artists, to, court, controversy., Théodore, Géricault's, Raft, of, the, Medusa, (c., 1820),, was, in, part, a, political, commentary, on, a, recent, event., Édouard, Manet's, Le, Déjeuner, sur, l'Herbe, (1863),, was, considered, scandalous, not, because, of, the, nude, woman,, but, because, she, is, seated, next, to, men, fully, dressed, in, the, clothing, of, the, time,, rather, than, in, robes, of, the, antique, world., John, Singer, Sargent's, Madame, Pierre, Gautreau, (Madam X), (1884),, caused, a, controversy, over, the, reddish, pink, used, to, color, the, woman's, ear, lobe,, considered, far, too, suggestive, and, supposedly, ruining, the, high-society, model's, reputation., The, gradual, abandonment, of, naturalism, and, the, depiction, of, realistic, representations, of, the, visual, appearance, of, subjects, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, led, to, a, rolling, controversy, lasting, for, over, a, century., In, the, twentieth, century,, Pablo, Picasso's, Guernica, (1937), used, arresting, cubist, techniques, and, stark, monochromatic, oils,, to, depict, the, harrowing, consequences, of, a, contemporary, bombing, of, a, small,, ancient, Basque, town., Leon, Golub's, Interrogation, III, (1981),, depicts, a, female, nude,, hooded, detainee, strapped, to, a, chair,, her, legs, open, to, reveal, her, sexual, organs,, surrounded, by, two, tormentors, dressed, in, everyday, clothing., Andres, Serrano's, Piss, Christ, (1989), is, a, photograph, of, a, crucifix,, sacred, to, the, Christian, religion, and, representing, Christ's, sacrifice, and, final, suffering,, submerged, in, a, glass, of, the, artist's, own, urine., The, resulting, uproar, led, to, comments, in, the, United, States, Senate, about, public, funding, of, the, arts., Theory, Main, article:, Aesthetics, Before, Modernism,, aesthetics, in, Western, art, was, greatly, concerned, with, achieving, the, appropriate, balance, between, different, aspects, of, realism, or, truth, to, nature, and, the, ideal;, ideas, as, to, what, the, appropriate, balance, is, have, shifted, to, and, fro, over, the, centuries., This, concern, is, largely, absent, in, other, traditions, of, art., The, aesthetic, theorist, John, Ruskin,, who, championed, what, he, saw, as, the, naturalism, of, J. M. W., Turner,, saw, art's, role, as, the, communication, by, artifice, of, an, essential, truth, that, could, only, be, found, in, nature.[66], The, definition, and, evaluation, of, art, has, become, especially, problematic, since, the, 20th, century., Richard, Wollheim, distinguishes, three, approaches, to, assessing, the, aesthetic, value, of, art:, the, Realist,, whereby, aesthetic, quality, is, an, absolute, value, independent, of, any, human, view;, the, Objectivist,, whereby, it, is, also, an, absolute, value,, but, is, dependent, on, general, human, experience;, and, the, Relativist, position,, whereby, it, is, not, an, absolute, value,, but, depends, on,, and, varies, with,, the, human, experience, of, different, humans.[67], Arrival, of, Modernism, Composition, II, in, Red,, Blue,, and, Yellow, (1930), by, Piet, Mondrian, (Dutch,, 1872–1944), The, arrival, of, Modernism, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, lead, to, a, radical, break, in, the, conception, of, the, function, of, art,[68], and, then, again, in, the, late, twentieth, century, with, the, advent, of, postmodernism., Clement, Greenberg's, 1960, article, "Modernist, Painting", defines, modern, art, as, "the, use, of, characteristic, methods, of, a, discipline, to, criticize, the, discipline, itself".[69], Greenberg, originally, applied, this, idea, to, the, Abstract, Expressionist, movement, and, used, it, as, a, way, to, understand, and, justify, flat, (non-illusionistic), abstract, painting:, Realistic,, naturalistic, art, had, dissembled, the, medium,, using, art, to, conceal, art;, modernism, used, art, to, call, attention, to, art., The, limitations, that, constitute, the, medium, of, painting—the, flat, surface,, the, shape, of, the, support,, the, properties, of, the, pigment—were, treated, by, the, Old, Masters, as, negative, factors, that, could, be, acknowledged, only, implicitly, or, indirectly., Under, Modernism, these, same, limitations, came, to, be, regarded, as, positive, factors,, and, were, acknowledged, openly.[69], After, Greenberg,, several, important, art, theorists, emerged,, such, as, Michael, Fried,, T. J. Clark,, Rosalind, Krauss,, Linda, Nochlin, and, Griselda, Pollock, among, others., Though, only, originally, intended, as, a, way, of, understanding, a, specific, set, of, artists,, Greenberg's, definition, of, modern, art, is, important, to, many, of, the, ideas, of, art, within, the, various, art, movements, of, the, 20th, century, and, early, 21st, century., Pop, artists, like, Andy, Warhol, became, both, noteworthy, and, influential, through, work, including, and, possibly, critiquing, popular, culture,, as, well, as, the, art, world., Artists, of, the, 1980s,, 1990s,, and, 2000s, expanded, this, technique, of, self-criticism, beyond, high, art, to, all, cultural, image-making,, including, fashion, images,, comics,, billboards, and, pornography., Duchamp, once, proposed, that, art, is, any, activity, of, any, kind-, everything., However,, the, way, that, only, certain, activities, are, classified, today, as, art, is, a, social, construction.[70], There, is, evidence, that, there, may, be, an, element, of, truth, to, this., The, Invention, of, Art:, A, Cultural, History, is, an, art, history, book, which, examines, the, construction, of, the, modern, system, of, the, arts, i.e., Fine, Art., Shiner, finds, evidence, that, the, older, system, of, the, arts, before, our, modern, system, (fine, art), held, art, to, be, any, skilled, human, activity, i.e., Ancient, Greek, society, did, not, possess, the, term, art, but, techne., Techne, can, be, understood, neither, as, art, or, craft,, the, reason, being, that, the, distinctions, of, art, and, craft, are, historical, products, that, came, later, on, in, human, history., Techne, included, painting,, sculpting, and, music, but, also;, cooking,, medicine,, horsemanship,, geometry,, carpentry,, prophecy,, and, farming, etc., New, Criticism, and, the, "intentional, fallacy", Following, Duchamp, during, the, first, half, of, the, twentieth, century,, a, significant, shift, to, general, aesthetic, theory, took, place, which, attempted, to, apply, aesthetic, theory, between, various, forms, of, art,, including, the, literary, arts, and, the, visual, arts,, to, each, other., This, resulted, in, the, rise, of, the, New, Criticism, school, and, debate, concerning, the, intentional, fallacy., At, issue, was, the, question, of, whether, the, aesthetic, intentions, of, the, artist, in, creating, the, work, of, art,, whatever, its, specific, form,, should, be, associated, with, the, criticism, and, evaluation, of, the, final, product, of, the, work, of, art,, or,, if, the, work, of, art, should, be, evaluated, on, its, own, merits, independent, of, the, intentions, of, the, artist., In, 1946,, William, K., Wimsatt, and, Monroe, Beardsley, published, a, classic, and, controversial, New, Critical, essay, entitled, "The, Intentional, Fallacy",, in, which, they, argued, strongly, against, the, relevance, of, an, author's, intention,, or, "intended, meaning", in, the, analysis, of, a, literary, work., For, Wimsatt, and, Beardsley,, the, words, on, the, page, were, all, that, mattered;, importation, of, meanings, from, outside, the, text, was, considered, irrelevant,, and, potentially, distracting., In, another, essay,, "The, Affective, Fallacy,", which, served, as, a, kind, of, sister, essay, to, "The, Intentional, Fallacy", Wimsatt, and, Beardsley, also, discounted, the, reader's, personal/emotional, reaction, to, a, literary, work, as, a, valid, means, of, analyzing, a, text., This, fallacy, would, later, be, repudiated, by, theorists, from, the, reader-response, school, of, literary, theory., Ironically,, one, of, the, leading, theorists, from, this, school,, Stanley, Fish,, was, himself, trained, by, New, Critics., Fish, criticizes, Wimsatt, and, Beardsley, in, his, essay, "Literature, in, the, Reader", (1970).[71], As, summarized, by, Gaut, and, Livingston, in, their, essay, "The, Creation, of, Art":, "Structuralist, and, post-structuralists, theorists, and, critics, were, sharply, critical, of, many, aspects, of, New, Criticism,, beginning, with, the, emphasis, on, aesthetic, appreciation, and, the, so-called, autonomy, of, art,, but, they, reiterated, the, attack, on, biographical, criticisms's, assumption, that, the, artist's, activities, and, experience, were, a, privileged, critical, topic."[72], These, authors, contend, that:, "Anti-intentionalists,, such, as, formalists,, hold, that, the, intentions, involved, in, the, making, of, art, are, irrelevant, or, peripheral, to, correctly, interpreting, art., So, details, of, the, act, of, creating, a, work,, though, possibly, of, interest, in, themselves,, have, no, bearing, on, the, correct, interpretation, of, the, work."[73], Gaut, and, Livingston, define, the, intentionalists, as, distinct, from, formalists, stating, that:, "Intentionalists,, unlike, formalists,, hold, that, reference, to, intentions, is, essential, in, fixing, the, correct, interpretation, of, works.", They, quote, Richard, Wollheim, as, stating, that,, "The, task, of, criticism, is, the, reconstruction, of, the, creative, process,, where, the, creative, process, must, in, turn, be, thought, of, as, something, not, stopping, short, of,, but, terminating, on,, the, work, of, art, itself."[73], "Linguistic, turn", and, its, debate, The, end, of, the, 20th, century, fostered, an, extensive, debate, known, as, the, linguistic, turn, controversy,, or, the, "innocent, eye, debate",, and, generally, referred, to, as, the, structuralism-poststructuralism, debate, in, the, philosophy, of, art., This, debate, discussed, the, encounter, of, the, work, of, art, as, being, determined, by, the, relative, extent, to, which, the, conceptual, encounter, with, the, work, of, art, dominates, over, the, perceptual, encounter, with, the, work, of, art.[74], Decisive, for, the, linguistic, turn, debate, in, art, history, and, the, humanities, were, the, works, of, yet, another, tradition,, namely, the, structuralism, of, Ferdinand, de, Saussure, and, the, ensuing, movement, of, poststructuralism., In, 1981,, the, artist, Mark, Tansey, created, a, work, of, art, titled, "The, Innocent, Eye", as, a, criticism, of, the, prevailing, climate, of, disagreement, in, the, philosophy, of, art, during, the, closing, decades, of, the, 20th, century., Influential, theorists, include, Judith, Butler,, Luce, Irigaray,, Julia, Kristeva,, Michel, Foucault, and, Jacques, Derrida., The, power, of, language,, more, specifically, of, certain, rhetorical, tropes,, in, art, history, and, historical, discourse, was, explored, by, Hayden, White., The, fact, that, language, is, not, a, transparent, medium, of, thought, had, been, stressed, by, a, very, different, form, of, philosophy, of, language, which, originated, in, the, works, of, Johann, Georg, Hamann, and, Wilhelm, von, Humboldt.[75], Ernst, Gombrich, and, Nelson, Goodman, in, his, book, Languages, of, Art:, An, Approach, to, a, Theory, of, Symbols, came, to, hold, that, the, conceptual, encounter, with, the, work, of, art, predominated, exclusively, over, the, perceptual, and, visual, encounter, with, the, work, of, art, during, the, 1960s, and, 1970s.[76], He, was, challenged, on, the, basis, of, research, done, by, the, Nobel, prize, winning, psychologist, Roger, Sperry, who, maintained, that, the, human, visual, encounter, was, not, limited, to, concepts, represented, in, language, alone, (the, linguistic, turn), and, that, other, forms, of, psychological, representations, of, the, work, of, art, were, equally, defensible, and, demonstrable., Sperry's, view, eventually, prevailed, by, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, with, aesthetic, philosophers, such, as, Nick, Zangwill, strongly, defending, a, return, to, moderate, aesthetic, formalism, among, other, alternatives.[77], Classification, disputes, Main, article:, Classificatory, disputes, about, art, The, original, Fountain, by, Marcel, Duchamp,, 1917,, photographed, by, Alfred, Stieglitz, at, the, 291, after, the, 1917, Society, of, Independent, Artists, exhibit., Stieglitz, used, a, backdrop, of, The, Warriors, by, Marsden, Hartley, to, photograph, the, urinal., The, exhibition, entry, tag, can, be, clearly, seen.[78], Disputes, as, to, whether, or, not, to, classify, something, as, a, work, of, art, are, referred, to, as, classificatory, disputes, about, art., Classificatory, disputes, in, the, 20th, century, have, included, cubist, and, impressionist, paintings,, Duchamp's, Fountain,, the, movies,, superlative, imitations, of, banknotes,, conceptual, art,, and, video, games.[79], Philosopher, David, Novitz, has, argued, that, disagreement, about, the, definition, of, art, are, rarely, the, heart, of, the, problem., Rather,, "the, passionate, concerns, and, interests, that, humans, vest, in, their, social, life", are, "so, much, a, part, of, all, classificatory, disputes, about, art", (Novitz,, 1996)., According, to, Novitz,, classificatory, disputes, are, more, often, disputes, about, societal, values, and, where, society, is, trying, to, go, than, they, are, about, theory, proper., For, example,, when, the, Daily, Mail, criticized, Hirst's, and, Emin's, work, by, arguing, "For, 1,000, years, art, has, been, one, of, our, great, civilising, forces., Today,, pickled, sheep, and, soiled, beds, threaten, to, make, barbarians, of, us, all", they, are, not, advancing, a, definition, or, theory, about, art,, but, questioning, the, value, of, Hirst's, and, Emin's, work.[80], In, 1998,, Arthur, Danto,, suggested, a, thought, experiment, showing, that, "the, status, of, an, artifact, as, work, of, art, results, from, the, ideas, a, culture, applies, to, it,, rather, than, its, inherent, physical, or, perceptible, qualities., Cultural, interpretation, (an, art, theory, of, some, kind), is, therefore, constitutive, of, an, object's, arthood."[81][82], Anti-art, is, a, label, for, art, that, intentionally, challenges, the, established, parameters, and, values, of, art;[83], it, is, term, associated, with, Dadaism, and, attributed, to, Marcel, Duchamp, just, before, World, War, I,[83], when, he, was, making, art, from, found, objects.[83], One, of, these,, Fountain, (1917),, an, ordinary, urinal,, has, achieved, considerable, prominence, and, influence, on, art.[83], Anti-art, is, a, feature, of, work, by, Situationist, International,[84], the, lo-fi, Mail, art, movement,, and, the, Young, British, Artists,[83], though, it, is, a, form, still, rejected, by, the, Stuckists,[83], who, describe, themselves, as, anti-anti-art.[85][86], Value, judgment, Aboriginal, hollow, log, tombs., National, Gallery,, Canberra,, Australia, Somewhat, in, relation, to, the, above,, the, word, art, is, also, used, to, apply, judgments, of, value,, as, in, such, expressions, as, "that, meal, was, a, work, of, art", (the, cook, is, an, artist),, or, "the, art, of, deception",, (the, highly, attained, level, of, skill, of, the, deceiver, is, praised)., It, is, this, use, of, the, word, as, a, measure, of, high, quality, and, high, value, that, gives, the, term, its, flavor, of, subjectivity., Making, judgments, of, value, requires, a, basis, for, criticism., At, the, simplest, level,, a, way, to, determine, whether, the, impact, of, the, object, on, the, senses, meets, the, criteria, to, be, considered, art, is, whether, it, is, perceived, to, be, attractive, or, repulsive., Though, perception, is, always, colored, by, experience,, and, is, necessarily, subjective,, it, is, commonly, understood, that, what, is, not, somehow, aesthetically, satisfying, cannot, be, art., However,, "good", art, is, not, always, or, even, regularly, aesthetically, appealing, to, a, majority, of, viewers., In, other, words,, an, artist's, prime, motivation, need, not, be, the, pursuit, of, the, aesthetic., Also,, art, often, depicts, terrible, images, made, for, social,, moral,, or, thought-provoking, reasons., For, example,, Francisco, Goya's, painting, depicting, the, Spanish, shootings, of, 3rd of, May, 1808, is, a, graphic, depiction, of, a, firing, squad, executing, several, pleading, civilians., Yet, at, the, same, time,, the, horrific, imagery, demonstrates, Goya's, keen, artistic, ability, in, composition, and, execution, and, produces, fitting, social, and, political, outrage., Thus,, the, debate, continues, as, to, what, mode, of, aesthetic, satisfaction,, if, any,, is, required, to, define, 'art'., The, assumption, of, new, values, or, the, rebellion, against, accepted, notions, of, what, is, aesthetically, superior, need, not, occur, concurrently, with, a, complete, abandonment, of, the, pursuit, of, what, is, aesthetically, appealing., Indeed,, the, reverse, is, often, true,, that, the, revision, of, what, is, popularly, conceived, of, as, being, aesthetically, appealing, allows, for, a, re-invigoration, of, aesthetic, sensibility,, and, a, new, appreciation, for, the, standards, of, art, itself., Countless, schools, have, proposed, their, own, ways, to, define, quality,, yet, they, all, seem, to, agree, in, at, least, one, point:, once, their, aesthetic, choices, are, accepted,, the, value, of, the, work, of, art, is, determined, by, its, capacity, to, transcend, the, limits, of, its, chosen, medium, to, strike, some, universal, chord, by, the, rarity, of, the, skill, of, the, artist, or, in, its, accurate, reflection, in, what, is, termed, the, zeitgeist., Art, is, often, intended, to, appeal, to, and, connect, with, human, emotion., It, can, arouse, aesthetic, or, moral, feelings,, and, can, be, understood, as, a, way, of, communicating, these, feelings., Artists, express, something, so, that, their, audience, is, aroused, to, some, extent,, but, they, do, not, have, to, do, so, consciously., Art, may, be, considered, an, exploration, of, the, human, condition;, that, is,, what, it, is, to, be, human.[87], See,
