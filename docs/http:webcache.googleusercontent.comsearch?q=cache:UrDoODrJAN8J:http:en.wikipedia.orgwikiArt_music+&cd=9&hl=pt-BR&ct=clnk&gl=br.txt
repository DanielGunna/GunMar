He, completed, the, piece, in, 1816., Art, music, (also, known, as, Western, classical, music,, cultivated, music,, serious, music,, canonic, music,, or, more, flippantly,, "real, music", and, "normal, music")[1], is, an, umbrella, term, that, refers, to, musical, traditions,, implying, advanced, structural, and, theoretical, considerations[2], and, a, written, musical, tradition.[3], "Serious", or, "cultivated", music, are, terms, frequently, used, as, a, contrast, for, ordinary,, everyday, music, (popular, and, folk, music,, also, called, "vernacular, music").[4], After, the, 20th, century,, art, music, was, divided, into, two, extensions:, "serious, music", and, "light, music".[5], Contents, 1, Definition, 2, Popular, music, 3, See, also, 4, References, 5, Further, reading, Definition[edit], This, term, is, mostly, used, to, refer, to, music, descending, from, the, tradition, of, Western, classical, music., Authors, associated, with, critical, musicology, movement, and, popular, music, studies, like, Philip, Tagg, tend, to, reject, the, elitism, associated, with, art, music;, he, refers, to, it, as, one, of, an, "axiomatic, triangle, consisting, of, 'folk',, 'art', and, 'popular', musics."[6], He, explains, that, each, of, these, three, is, distinguishable, from, the, others, according, to, certain, criteria.[6], Musician, Catherine, Schmidt-Jones, defines, art, music, differently,, as, "a, music, which, requires, significantly, more, work, by, the, listener, to, fully, appreciate, than, is, typical, of, popular, music.", In, her, view,, "[t]his, can, include, the, more, challenging, types, of, jazz, and, rock, music,, as, well, as, Classical."[7], The, term, may, also, refer, to:, The, classical/art, music, traditions, of, several, different, cultures, around, the, world;, Some, forms, of, jazz,, excluding, most, forms, generally, considered, popular, music., Jazz, is, generally, considered, popular, music., (Adorno, for, example, refers, to, jazz, as, some, kind, of, popular, music),[8], Music, that, is, highly, formalized,, that, is,, in, which, all, or, most, musical, elements, are, specified, in, advance,, usually, in, written, notation,, as, opposed, to, being, improvised, or, otherwise, left, up, to, the, performer's, discretion.[9], The, term[clarification, needed, (is, the, source, referring, to, "art, music", or, "serious, music"?)], refers, primarily, to, classical, traditions, (including, contemporary, as, well, as, historical, classical, music, forms), that, focus, on, formal, styles,, invite, technical, and, detailed, deconstruction[2], and, criticism,, and, demand, focused, attention, from, the, listener., In, strict, western, practice,, art, music, is, considered, primarily, a, written, musical, tradition,[3], preserved, in, some, form, of, music, notation,, as, opposed, to, being, transmitted, orally,, by, rote,, or, in, recordings, (like, popular, and, traditional, music).[3][10], Popular, music[edit], There, have, been, continual, attempts, throughout, the, history, of, popular, music, to, make, a, claim, for, itself, as, art, rather, than, as, popular, culture,, and, a, number, of, music, styles, that, were, previously, understood, as, "popular, music", have, since, been, categorized, in, the, art, or, classical, category.[11], According, to, the, academic, Tim, Wall,, the, most, significant, example, of, the, struggle, between, Tin, Pan, Alley,, African, American,, vernacular, and, art, discourses, was, in, jazz., As, early, as, the, 1930s,, artists, attempted, to, cultivate, ideas, of, "symphonic, jazz",, taking, it, away, from, its, perceived, vernacular, and, black, American, roots., Following, these, developments,, histories, of, popular, music, tend, to, marginalize, jazz,, partly, because, the, reformulation, of, jazz, in, the, art, discourse, has, been, so, successful, that, many, people, today, will, not, consider, it, a, form, of, popular, music.[11], In, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century,, there, was, a, large-scale, trend, in, American, culture, in, which, the, boundaries, between, art, and, pop, music, became, increasingly, blurred.[12], Beginning, in, 1966,, the, degree, of, social, and, artistic, dialogue, among, rock, musicians, dramatically, accelerated, for, bands, who, fused, elements, of, composed, music, with, the, oral, musical, traditions, of, rock.[13], During, the, late, 1960s, and, 1970s,, progressive, rock, bands, represented, a, form, of, crossover, music, that, combined, rock, with, high, art, musical, forms, either, through, quotation,, illusion,, or, imitation.[12], Progressive, music, may, be, equated, with, explicit, references, to, aspects, of, art, music,, sometimes, resulting, in, the, reification, of, rock, as, art, music.[13], While, progressive, rock, is, often, cited, for, its, merging, of, high, culture, and, low, culture,, few, artists, incorporated, literal, classical, themes, in, their, work, to, any, great, degree,, as, author, Kevin, Holm-Hudson, explains:, "sometimes, progressive, rock, fails, to, integrate, classical, sources, ..., [it], moves, continuously, between, explicit, and, implicit, references, to, genres, and, strategies, derived, not, only, from, European, art, music,, but, other, cultural, domains, (such, as, East, Indian,, Celtic,, folk,, and, African), and, hence, involves, a, continuous, aesthetic, movement, between, formalism, and, eclecticism."[13], See, also[edit], Wikimedia, Commons, has, media, related,
