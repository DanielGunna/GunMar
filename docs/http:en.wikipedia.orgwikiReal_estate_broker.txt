estate, agent), is, a, person, who, acts, as, an, intermediary, between, sellers, and, buyers, of, real, estate/real, property, and, attempts, to, match, up, sellers, who, wish, to, sell, and, buyers, who, wish, to, buy., In, the, United, States,, the, relationship, was, originally, established, by, reference, to, the, English, common, law, of, agency,, with, the, broker, having, a, fiduciary, relationship, with, his, or, her, clients., A, real, estate, broker, typically, receives, a, payment, called, a, commission, for, successfully, matching, a, seller's, real, estate, with, a, buyer, such, that, a, sale, can, be, made., This, commission, can, be, divided, up, with, other, participating, real, estate, brokers, or, agents, when, applicable., An, estate, agent,, which, is, a, term, used, in, the, United, Kingdom,, is, a, person, or, business, entity, whose, business, is, to, market, real, estate, on, behalf, of, clients., There, are, significant, differences, between, the, actions,, powers,, obligations, and, liabilities, of, brokers, and, estate, agents, in, each, country., Other, countries, take, markedly, different, approaches, to, the, marketing, and, selling, of, real, property., In, the, United, States,, however,, real, estate, brokers, and, their, salespersons, who, assist, owners, in, marketing,, selling,, or, leasing, properties, are, commonly, called, "listing, brokers", and, "listing, agents.", [1], Listing, brokers, and, agents, seek, to, market, and, sell, or, lease, property, for, the, highest, available, price, under, the, best, available, terms., Other, brokers, and, agents, may, focus, on, representing, buyers, or, tenants., However,, licensing, as, a, broker, or, salesperson, authorizes, the, licensee, to, represent, parties, on, either, side, of, a, transaction., The, choice, of, which, side, to, represent, is, a, business, decision, for, the, licensee., In, the, U.S.,, real, estate, brokers, and, salespersons, are, licensed, by, each, state,, not, by, the, federal, government., Each, state, has, its, own, laws, defining, the, types, of, relationships, that, can, exist, between, clients, and, real, estate, licensees,, and, the, duties, of, real, estate, licensees, to, clients, and, members, of, the, public., These, rules, differ, substantially, from, state, to, state,, for, example,, on, subjects, that, include, required, documentation,, agency, relationships,, inspections,, disclosures,, continuing, education,, and, other, subjects., Contents, 1, Buyer's, agent, 2, Written, Agreement, 3, Dual, agent, 4,

brokers, and, salespersons, assist, buyers, by, helping, them, purchase, property, for, the, lowest, available, price, under, the, best, terms., The, real, estate, broker, owes, fiduciary, duties, to, whomever, that, broker, services, as, a, client., Written, Agreement[edit], It, is, important, to, have, a, clear, agreement, between, the, broker, and, the, client,, for, the, protection, of, both, of, them., These, agreements, should, (and, in, many, U.S., states, must), be, in, writing., If, the, parties, only, have, an, oral, agreement,, it, is, more, likely, for, a, dispute, to, arise, concerning, the, services, the, broker, or, agent, is, supposed, to, provide,, whether, the, broker, can, enforce, the, parties', compensation, agreement,, the, duration, of, the, relationship,, whether, the, relationship, is, "exclusive,", and, other, issues., Enforceability, of, oral, agreements,, what, kinds, of, agreements, are, required, to, be, in, writing,, and, other, important, issues, vary, from, state, to, state., Dual, agent[edit], If, the, broker, is, helping, both, the, buyer, and, the, seller,, this, is, referred, to, as, a, "dual, agency"., Traditionally,, the, broker, represents, the, seller,, and, his, fiduciary, duty, is, to, the, seller., If, the, broker, suggests, to, the, buyer, that, he, will, help, the, buyer, negotiate, the, best, price,, the, broker, is, practicing, "undisclosed, dual, agency,", which, is, unethical, and, illegal, in, all, states.[2], Under, a, dual, agency, transaction,, it, is, vital, that, the, broker, disclose, to, both, parties, whom, he, represents, as, a, client, and, whom, he, represents, as, a, customer., A, real, estate, broker, owes, his, client, fiduciary, duties,, which, include, care,, confidentiality,, loyalty,, obedience,, accounting,, and, disclosure., To, protect, his, license, to, practice,, a, real, estate, broker, owes, his, customer, fair, and, honest, dealing, and, must, request, that, both, parties, (seller, and, buyer), sign, a, dual, agency, agreement., Licensing[edit], In, most, jurisdictions, in, the, United, States,, a, person, must, have, a, license, before, they, may, receive, remuneration, for, services, rendered, as, a, real, estate, broker., Unlicensed, activity, is, illegal,, but, buyers, and, sellers, acting, as, principals, in, the, sale, or, purchase, of, real, estate, are, usually, not, required, to, be, licensed., In, some, states,, lawyers, are, authorized, to, handle, real, estate, sales, for, compensation, without, being, licensed, as, brokers, or, agents.[citation, needed], The, difference, between, salespersons, and, brokers[edit], Before, the, Multiple, Listing, Service, (MLS), was, introduced, in, 1967,, when, brokers, (and, their, licensees), only, represented, sellers,, the, term, "real, estate, salesperson", may, have, been, more, appropriate, than, it, is, today,, given, the, various, ways, that, brokers, and, licensees, now, help, buyers, through, the, process, rather, than, merely, "selling", them, a, property., Legally,, however,, the, term, "salesperson", is, still, used, in, many, states, to, describe, a, real, estate, licensee., Real, estate, education[edit], To, become, licensed,, most, states, require, that, an, applicant, take, a, minimum, number, of, classroom, hours, before, taking, the, state, licensing, exam., Such, education, is, often, provided, by, real, estate, firms, or, by, education, companies,, either, of, which, are, typically, licensed, to, teach, such, courses, within, their, respective, states., The, courses, are, designed, to, prepare, the, new, licensee, primarily, for, the, legal, aspects, of, the, practice, of, real, estate, and, to, pass, the, state, licensing, exam., Once, licensed,, the, licensee, in, most, states, is, initially, designated, a, salesperson, and, must, work, under, a, broker's, license., Some, other, states, have, recently, eliminated, the, salesperson's, license, and, instead, all, licensees, in, those, states, automatically, earn, their, broker's, license., A, salesperson, must, place, their, license, under, a, managing, broker., Typically, there, may, be, multiple, licensees, holding, broker's, licenses, within, a, firm, but, only, one, broker, or, the, firm, itself,, is, the, managing, or, principal, broker, and, that, individual, or, firm, is, then, legally, responsible, for, all, licenses, held, under, their, license., The, term, agent, is, not, to, be, confused, with, salesperson, or, broker., An, agent, is, simply, a, licensee, that, has, entered, into, an, agent, relationship, with, a, client., A, broker, can, also, be, an, agent, for, a, client., It, is, commonly, the, firm, that, has, the, actual, legal, relationship, with, the, client, through, one, of, their, sales, staff,, be, they, salespersons, or, brokers., In, all, states,, the, real, estate, licensee, must, disclose, to, prospective, buyers, and, sellers, the, nature, of, their, relationship, [3], within, the, transaction, and, with, the, parties., See, below, for, a, broker/licensee, relationship, to, sellers, and, their, relationship, to, buyers., In, the, United, States,, there, are, commonly, two, levels, of, real, estate, professionals, licensed, by, the, individual, states, but, not, by, the, federal, government:, Real, estate, salesperson, (or,, in, some, states,, Real, estate, broker)[edit], When, a, person, first, becomes, licensed, to, become, a, real, estate, agent,, they, obtain, a, real, estate, salesperson's, license, (some, states, use, the, term, "broker"), from, the, state, in, which, s/he, will, practice., To, obtain, a, real, estate, license,, the, candidate, must, take, specific, coursework, (between, 40, and, 120, hours), and, pass, a, state, exam, on, real, estate, law, and, practice., To, work,, salespersons, must, be, associated, with, (and, act, under, the, authority, of), a, real, estate, broker., In, Delaware,, for, example,, the, licensing, course, requires, the, candidate, to, take, 99, classroom, hours, in, order, to, qualify, to, sit, for, the, state, and, national, examination., In, Ohio,, a, license, candidate, must, complete, 120, hours, of, classroom, education., Each, successive, year, thereafter,, the, license, holder, must, participate, in, continuing, education, in, order, to, remain, abreast, of, state, and, national, changes., Many, states, also, have, reciprocal, agreements, with, other, states,, allowing, a, licensed, individual, from, a, qualified, state, to, take, the, second, state's, exam, without, completing, the, course, requirements, or,, in, some, cases,, take, only, a, state, law, exam., Real, estate, broker, (or,, in, some, states,, qualifying, broker)[edit], After, gaining, some, years, of, experience, in, real, estate, sales,, a, salesperson, may, decide, to, become, licensed, as, a, real, estate, broker, (or, Principal/qualifying, broker), in, order, to, own,, manage,, or, operate, their, own, brokerage., In, addition,, some, states, allow, college, graduates, to, apply, for, a, broker's, license, without, years, of, experience., College, graduates, fall, into, this, category, once, they, have, completed, the, state-required, courses, as, well., California, allows, licensed, attorneys, to, become, brokers, upon, passing, the, broker, exam, without, having, to, take, the, requisite, courses, required, of, an, agent., Commonly, more, course, work, and, a, broker's, state, exam, on, real, estate, law, must, be, passed., Upon, obtaining, a, broker's, license,, a, real, estate, agent, may, continue, to, work, for, another, broker, in, a, similar, capacity, as, before, (often, referred, to, as, a, broker, associate, or, associate, broker), or, take, charge, of, his/her, own, brokerage, and, hire, other, salespersons, (or, broker), licensees., Becoming, a, branch, office, manager, may, or, may, not, require, a, broker's, license., Some, states, allow, licensed, attorneys, to, become, real, estate, brokers, without, taking, any, exam., In, some, states,, there, are, no, "salespeople", as, all, licensees, are, brokers.[4], Agency, relationships, with, clients, versus, non-agency, relationships, with, customers[edit], Relationship:, Conventionally,, the, broker, provides, a, conventional, full-service,, commission-based, brokerage, relationship, under, a, signed, listing, agreement, with, a, seller, or, a, "buyer, representation", agreement, with, a, buyer,, thus, creating, under, common, law, in, most, states, an, agency, relationship, with, fiduciary, obligations., The, seller, or, buyer, is, then, a, client, of, the, broker., Some, states, also, have, statutes, that, define, and, control, the, nature, of, the, representation., Agency, relationships, in, residential, real, estate, transactions, involve, the, legal, representation, by, a, real, estate, broker, (on, behalf, of, a, real, estate, company), of, the, principal,, whether, that, person(s), is, a, buyer, or, a, seller., The, broker, and, his, licensed, real, estate, salespersons, (salesmen, or, brokers), then, become, the, agents, of, the, principal., Non-agency, relationship:, where, no, written, agreement, or, fiduciary, relationship, exists,, a, real, estate, broker, and, his, sales, staff, work, with, a, principal, who, is, known, as, the, broker's, customer., When, a, buyer, who, has, not, entered, into, a, Buyer, Agency, agreement, with, the, broker, buys, a, property,, that, broker, functions, as, the, sub-agent, of, the, seller's, broker., When, a, seller, chooses, to, work, with, a, transaction, broker,, there, is, no, agency, relationship, created., Transaction, brokers[edit], Some, state, Real, Estate, Commissions, -, notably, Florida's[5], after, 1992, (and, extended, in, 2003), and, Colorado's[6], after, 1994, (with, changes, in, 2003), -, created, the, option, of, having, no, agency, or, fiduciary, relationship, between, brokers, and, sellers, or, buyers., Having, no, more, than, a, facilitator, relationship,, transaction, brokers, assist, buyers,, sellers,, or, both, during, the, transaction, without, representing, the, interests, of, either, party, who, may, then, be, regarded, as, customers., As, noted, by, the, South, Broward, Board, of, Realtors,, Inc., in, a, letter, to, State, of, Florida, legislative, committees:, "The, Transaction, Broker, crafts, a, transaction, by, bringing, a, willing, buyer, and, a, willing, seller, together, and, assists, with, the, closing, of, details., The, Transaction, Broker, is, not, a, fiduciary, of, any, party,, but, must, abide, by, law, as, well, as, professional, and, ethical, standards.", (such, as, NAR, Code, of, Ethics)., The, result, was, that, in, 2003,, Florida, created, a, system, where, the, default, brokerage, relationship, had, "all, licensees ..., operating, as, transaction, brokers,, unless, a, single, agent, or, no, brokerage, relationship, is, established,, in, writing,, with, the, customer"[7][8], and, the, statute, required, written, disclosure, of, the, transaction, brokerage, relationship, to, the, buyer, or, seller, customer, only, through, July, 1,, 2008., In, the, case, of, both, Florida[8], and, Colorado,[6], dual, agency, and, sub-agency, (where, both, listing, and, selling, agents, represent, the, seller), no, longer, exist., Designated, agency[edit], The, most, recent, development, in, the, practice, of, real, estate, is, "designated, agency"[9], which, was, created, to, permit, individual, licensees, within, the, same, firm,, designated, by, the, principal, broker,, to, act, as, agents, for, individual, buyers, and, sellers, within, the, same, transaction., In, theory, therefore,, two, agents, within, the, same, firm, act, in, strict, fiduciary, roles, for, their, respective, clients., Some, states, have, adopted, this, practice, into, their, state, laws, and, others, have, decided, this, function, is, inherently, problematic,, just, as, was, dual, agency., The, practice, was, invented, and, promoted, by, larger, firms, to, make, it, possible, in, theory, to, handle, the, entire, transaction, in, house, without, creating, a, conflict, of, interest, within, the, firm., Dual, or, limited, agency[edit], Dual, agency, occurs, when, the, same, brokerage, represents, both, the, seller, and, the, buyer, under, written, agreements., Individual, state, laws, vary, and, interpret, dual, agency, rather, differently., Many, states, no, longer, allow, dual, agency., Instead,, "transaction, brokerage", provides, the, buyer, and, seller, with, a, limited, form, of, representation, but, without, any, fiduciary, obligations, (see, Florida, law)., Buyers, and, sellers, are, generally, advised, to, consult, a, licensed, real, estate, professional, for, a, written, definition, of, an, individual, state's, laws, of, agency,, and, many, states, require, written, Disclosures, to, be, signed, by, all, parties, outlining, the, duties, and, obligations., If, state, law, allows, for, the, same, agent, to, represent, both, the, buyer, and, the, seller, in, a, single, transaction,, the, brokerage/agent, is, typically, considered, to, be, a, Dual, Agent., Special, laws/rules, often, apply, to, dual, agents,, especially, in, negotiating, price., In, some, states,, Dual, Agency, can, be, practiced, in, situations, where, the, same, brokerage, (but, not, agent), represent, both, the, buyer, and, the, seller., If, one, agent, from, the, brokerage, has, a, home, listed, and, another, agent, from, that, brokerage, has, a, buyer-brokerage, agreement, with, a, buyer, who, wishes, to, buy, the, listed, property,, Dual, Agency, occurs, by, allowing, each, agent, to, be, designated, as, an, "intra-company", agent., Only, the, broker, himself, is, the, Dual, Agent., Some, states, do, allow, a, broker, and, one, agent, to, represent, both, sides, of, the, transaction, as, dual, agents., In, those, situations,, conflict, of, interest, is, more, likely, to, occur,, typically, resulting, in, the, loss, of, advocacy, for, both, parties., Types, of, services, that, a, broker, can, provide[edit], Real, Estate, Services, are, also, called, trading, services, [10], by, some, jurisdictions., Since, each, province's, and, state's, laws, may, differ,, it, is, generally, advised, that, prospective, sellers, or, buyers, consult, a, licensed, real, estate, professional., Some, examples:, Comparative, Market, Analysis, (CMA) —, an, estimate, of, the, home's, value, compared, with, others., This, differs, from, an, appraisal, in, that, property, currently, for, sale, may, be, taken, into, consideration., (competition, for, the, subject, property), Total, Market, Overview —, an, objective, method, for, determining, a, home's, value,, where, a, CMA, is, subjective., Broker's, Price, Opinion —, estimate, of, a, property's, value, or, potential, selling, price, Real, estate, appraisal —, in, most, states,, only, if, the, broker, is, also, licensed, as, an, appraiser., Exposure —, Marketing, the, real, property, to, prospective, buyers., Facilitating, a, Purchase —, guiding, a, buyer, through, the, process., Facilitating, a, Sale —, guiding, a, seller, through, the, selling, process., FSBO, document, preparation —, preparing, necessary, paperwork, for, "For, Sale, By, Owner", sellers., Home, Selling, Kits —, guides, advising, how, to, market, and, sell, a, property., Hourly, Consulting, for, a, fee,, based, on, the, client's, needs., Leasing, for, a, fee, or, percentage, of, the, gross, lease, value., Property, Management, Exchanging, property., Auctioning, property., Preparing, contracts, and, leases., (not, in, all, states), These, services, are, also, changing, as, a, variety, of, real, estate, trends, transform, the, industry., Real, estate, brokers, and, sellers[edit], Services, provided, to, seller, as, client[edit], Upon, signing, a, listing, contract, with, the, seller, wishing, to, sell, the, real, estate,, the, brokerage, attempts, to, earn, a, commission, by, finding, a, buyer, for, the, sellers', property, for, the, highest, possible, price, on, the, best, terms, for, the, seller., In, Canada,, most, provinces', laws, require, the, real, estate, agent, to, forward, all, written, offers, to, the, seller, for, consideration, or, review., To, help, accomplish, the, goal, of, finding, buyers,, a, real, estate, agency, commonly, does, the, following:[citation, needed], Lists, the, property, for, sale, to, the, public,, often, on, an, MLS,, in, addition, to, any, other, methods., Provides, the, seller, with, a, real, property, condition, disclosure, (if, required, by, law), and, other, necessary, forms., Prepares, necessary, papers, describing, the, property, for, advertising,, pamphlets,, open, houses,, etc., Places, a, "For, Sale", sign, on, the, property, indicating, how, to, contact, the, real, estate, office, and, agent., advertises, the, property,, which, may, include, social, media, and, digital, marketing, in, addition, to, paper, advertising., Holds, an, open, house, to, show, the, property., Serves, as, a, contact, available, to, answer, any, questions, about, the, property, and, schedule, showing, appointments., Ensures, that, buyers, are, pre-screened, and, financially, qualified, to, buy, the, property., (Sellers, should, be, aware, that, the, underwriter, for, any, real, estate, mortgage, loan, is, the, final, say.), Negotiates, price, on, behalf, of, the, sellers., Acts, as, a, fiduciary, for, the, seller,, which, may, include, preparing, a, standard, real, estate, purchase, contract., Holds, an, earnest, payment, cheque, in, escrow, from, the, buyer(s), until, the, closing, if, necessary., In, many, states,, the, closing, is, the, meeting, between, the, buyer, and, seller, where, the, property, is, transferred, and, the, title, is, conveyed, by, a, deed., In, other, states,, especially, those, in, the, West,, closings, take, place, during, a, defined, escrow, period, when, buyers, and, sellers, each, sign, the, appropriate, papers, transferring, title,, but, do, not, meet, each, other., The, listing, contract[edit], Main, article:, Listing, contract, Several, types, of, listing, contracts, exist, between, broker, and, seller., These, may, be, defined, as:, Exclusive, right, to, sell, The, broker, is, given, the, exclusive, right, to, market, the, property, and, represents, the, seller, exclusively., This, is, referred, to, as, seller, agency., However,, the, brokerage, also, offers, to, cooperate, with, other, brokers, and, agrees, to, allow, them, to, show, the, property, to, prospective, buyers, and, offers, a, share, of, the, total, real, estate, commission., Exclusive, agency, Exclusive, agency, allows, only, the, broker, the, right, to, sell, the, property,, and, no, offer, of, compensation, is, ever, made, to, another, broker., In, this, case,, the, property, will, never, be, entered, into, an, MLS., Naturally,, this, limits, the, exposure, of, the, property, to, only, one, agency., Open, listing, The, property, is, available, for, sale, by, any, real, estate, professional, who, can, advertise,, show,, or, negotiate, the, sale., The, broker/agent, who, first, brings, an, acceptable, offer, would, receive, compensation., Real, estate, companies, will, typically, require, that, a, written, agreement, for, an, open, listing, be, signed, by, the, seller, to, ensure, payment, of, a, commission, if, a, sale, takes, place., Although, there, can, be, other, ways, of, doing, business,, a, real, estate, brokerage, usually, earns, its, commission, after, the, real, estate, broker, and, a, seller, enter, into, a, listing, contract, and, fulfill, agreed-upon, terms, specified, within, that, contract., The, seller's, real, estate, is, then, listed, for, sale., In, most, of, North, America,, a, listing, agreement, or, contract, [11], between, broker, and, seller, must, include, the, following:, starting, and, ending, dates, of, the, agreement;, the, price, at, which, the, property, will, be, offered, for, sale;, the, amount, of, compensation, due, to, the, broker;, how, much,, if, any,, of, the, compensation, will, be, offered, to, a, cooperating, broker, who, may, bring, a, buyer, (required, for, MLS, listings)., Net, listings:, Property, listings, at, an, agreed-upon, net, price, that, the, seller, wishes, to, receive, with, any, excess, going, to, the, broker, as, commission., In, many, states, including, Georgia,, New, Jersey, and, Virginia, [18, VAC, §135-20-280(5)], net, listings, are, illegal,, other, states, such, as, California, and, Texas, state, authorities, discourage, the, practice, and, have, laws, to, try, and, avoid, manipulation, and, unfair, transactions, [22, TAC, §535(b)], and, (c).[12], Brokerage, commissions[edit], In, consideration, of, the, brokerage, successfully, finding, a, buyer, for, the, property,, a, broker, anticipates, receiving, a, commission, for, the, services, the, brokerage, has, provided., Usually, the, payment, of, a, commission, to, the, brokerage, is, contingent, upon, finding, a, buyer, for, the, real, estate,, the, successful, negotiation, of, a, purchase, contract, between, the, buyer, and, seller,, or, the, settlement, of, the, transaction, and, the, exchange, of, money, between, buyer, and, seller., The, median, real, estate, commission, charged, to, the, seller, by, the, listing, (seller's), agent, is, 6%, of, the, purchase, price., Typically,, this, commission, is, split, evenly, between, the, seller's, and, buyer's, agents,, with, the, buyer's, agent, generally, receiving, a, commission, of, 3%, of, the, purchase, price, of, the, home, sold., In, North, America,, commissions, on, real, estate, transactions, are, negotiable, and, new, services, in, real, estate, trends, have, created, ways, to, negotiate, rates., Local, real, estate, sales, activity, usually, dictates, the, amount, of, agreed, commission., Real, estate, commission, is, typically, paid, by, the, seller, at, the, closing, of, the, transaction, as, detailed, in, the, listing, agreement., RESPA[edit], Real, estate, brokers, who, work, with, lenders, may, not, receive, any, compensation, from, the, lender, for, referring, a, residential, client, to, a, specific, lender., To, do, so, would, be, a, violation, of, a, United, States, federal, law, known, as, the, Real, Estate, Settlement, Procedures, Act, (RESPA)., Commercial, transactions, are, exempt, from, RESPA., All, lender, compensation, to, a, broker, must, be, disclosed, to, all, parties., A, commission, may, also, be, paid, during, negotiation, of, contract, base, on, seller, and, agent., Lock-box[edit], With, the, seller's, permission,, a, lock-box, is, placed, on, homes, that, are, occupied,, and, after, arranging, an, appointment, with, the, homeowner,, agents, can, show, the, home, to, prospective, buyers., When, a, property, is, vacant,, a, lock-box, will, generally, be, placed, on, the, front, door., The, listing, broker, helps, arrange, showings, of, the, property, by, various, real, estate, agents, from, all, companies, associated, with, the, MLS., The, lock-box, contains, the, key, to, the, door, of, the, property,, and, the, box, can, only, be, opened, by, licensed, real, estate, agents., Shared, commissions, with, co-op, brokers[edit], If, any, buyer's, broker, or, his, agents, brings, the, buyer, for, the, property,, the, buyer's, broker, would, typically, be, compensated, with, a, co-op, commission, coming, from, the, total, offered, to, the, listing, broker,, often, about, half, of, the, full, commission, from, the, seller., If, an, agent, or, salesperson, working, for, the, buyer's, broker, brings, the, buyer, for, the, property,, then, the, buyer's, broker, would, commonly, compensate, his, agent, with, a, fraction, of, the, co-op, commission,, again, as, determined, in, a, separate, agreement., A, discount, brokerage, may, offer, a, reduced, commission, if, no, other, brokerage, firm, is, involved, and, no, co-op, commission, paid, out., If, there, is, no, co-commission, to, pay, to, another, brokerage,, the, listing, brokerage, receives, the, full, amount, of, the, commission, minus, any, other, types, of, expenses., Real, estate, brokers, and, buyers[edit], This, section, possibly, contains, original, research., Please, improve, it, by, verifying, the, claims, made, and, adding, inline, citations., Statements, consisting, only, of, original, research, should, be, removed., (September, 2012), (Learn, how, and, when, to, remove, this, template, message), This, section, does, not, cite, any, sources., Please, help, improve, this,

Services, provided, to, buyers[edit], Buyers, as, clients[edit], With, the, increase, in, the, practice, of, buyer, brokerages, in, the, United, States,, agents, (acting, under, their, brokers), have, been, able, to, represent, buyers, in, the, transaction, with, a, written, "Buyer, Agency, Agreement", not, unlike, the, "Listing, Agreement", for, sellers, referred, to, above., In, this, case,, buyers, are, clients, of, the, brokerage., Some, brokerages, represent, buyers, only, and, are, known, as, exclusive, buyer, agents, (EBAs)., Consumer, Reports, states,, "You, can, find, a, true, buyer's, agent, only, at, a, firm, that, does, not, accept, listings."[13], The, advantages, of, using, an, Exclusive, Buyer, Agent, is, that, they, avoid, conflicts, of, interest, by, working, in, the, best, interests, of, the, buyer, and, not, the, seller,, avoid, homes, and, neighborhoods, likely, to, fare, poorly, in, the, marketplace,, ensure, the, buyer, does, not, unknowingly, overpay, for, a, property,, fully, inform, the, buyer, of, adverse, conditions,, encourage, the, buyer, to, make, offers, based, on, true, value, instead, of, list, price,, and, work, to, save, the, buyer, money., A, buyer, agency, firm, commissioned, a, study, that, found, EBA, purchased, homes, were, 17, times, less, likely, to, go, into, foreclosure.[citation, needed], A, real, estate, brokerage, attempts, to, do, the, following, for, the, buyers, of, real, estate, only, when, they, represent, the, buyers, with, some, form, of, written, buyer-brokerage, agreement:, Find, real, estate, in, accordance, with, the, buyers, needs,, specifications,, and, cost., Take, buyers, to, and, shows, them, properties, available, for, sale., Pre-screen, buyers, to, ensure, they, are, financially, qualified, to, buy, the, properties, shown, (or, use, a, mortgage, professional,, such, a, bank's, mortgage, specialist, or, alternatively, a, Mortgage, broker,, to, do, that, task)., Negotiate, price, and, terms, on, behalf, of, the, buyers., Prepare, standard, real, estate, purchase, contract., Act, as, a, fiduciary, for, the, buyer., Find, real, estate, in, accordance, with, the, buyers', needs,, specifications,, and, affordability., When, deemed, appropriate,, prescreen, buyers, to, ensure, they, are, financially, qualified, to, buy, the, properties, shown.†, Assist, the, buyer, in, making, an, offer, for, the, property., †Due, to, the, importance, of, the, role, of, representing, buyers', interests,, many, brokers, who, seek, to, play, the, role, of, client, advocate, are, now, seeking, out, the, services, of, Certified, Mortgage, Planners,, industry, experts, that, work, in, concert, with, Certified, Financial, Planners, to, align, consumers', home, finance, positions, with, their, larger, financial, portfolio(s)., Buyers, as, customers[edit], In, most, states, until, the, 1990s,, buyers, who, worked, with, an, agent, of, a, real, estate, broker, in, finding, a, house, were, customers, of, the, brokerage, since, the, broker, represented, only, sellers., Today,, state, laws, differ., Buyers, and/or, sellers, may, be, represented., Typically,, a, written, "Buyer, Brokerage", agreement, is, required, for, the, buyer, to, have, representation, (regardless, of, which, party, is, paying, the, commission),, although, by, his/her, actions,, an, agent, can, create, representation., Education[edit], A, person, may, attend, a, pre-license, course, lasting, 60, hours, and, then, be, tested, by, the, state, for, a, real, estate, agent's, license., Upon, passing,, the, new, licensee, must, place, their, license, with, an, established, real, estate, firm,, managed, by, a, broker., Requirements, vary, by, state, but, after, some, period, of, time, working, as, an, agent,, one, may, return, to, the, classroom, and, test, to, become, a, broker., For, example,, California, and, Florida, require, you, to, have, a, minimum, experience, of, two, years, as, a, full-time, licensed, agent, within, the, prior, 5, years., Where, as, Indiana, only, requires, one, year, experience, as, a, real, estate, salesperson, and, Arizona, requires, three, out, of, the, prior, five, years.[14][15], Brokers, may, manage, or, own, firms., Each, branch, office, of, a, larger, real, estate, firm, must, be, managed, by, a, broker., States, issue, licenses, for, a, multi, year, period, and, require, real, estate, agents, and, brokers, to, complete, continuing, education, prior, to, renewing, their, licenses., For, example,, California, licensees, must, complete, 45, hours, of, continuing, education, every, 4, years, in, topics, such, as, agency,, trust, fund, handling,, consumer, protection,, fair, housing,, ethics,, and, risk, management., Many, states, recognize, licenses, from, other, states, and, issue, licenses, to, existing, agents, and, firms, upon, request, without, additional, education, or, testing, however, the, license, must, be, granted, before, real, estate, service, is, provided, in, the, state., California, does, not, have, license, reciprocity, with, other, states., An, applicant, for, licensure, is, not,, however,, required, to, be, a, resident, of, California, to, obtain, a, license., Organizations[edit], Several, notable, groups, exist, to, promote, the, real, estate, industry, and, to, assist, members, who, are, in, it., The, National, Association, of, Realtors, (NAR), is, the, largest, real, estate, organization, and, one, of, the, largest, trade, groups, anywhere., Their, membership, exceeds, one, million., NAR, also, has, state, chapters, as, well, as, thousands, of, local, chapters., Upon, joining, a, local, chapter,, a, new, member, is, automatically, enrolled, into, the, state, and, national, organizations., When, the, principals, of, a, firm, join,, all, licensed, agents, in, that, firm, must, also, belong., A, Realtor, is, a, real, estate, broker, or, salesperson, who, is, also, a, member, of, the, National, Association, of, Realtors,, which, is, an, industry, trade, association., The, word, "Realtor", is, a, registered, trademark,, protected, under, US, and, international, law., The, Realtor, Political, Action, Committee, (RPAC), is, a, separate, entity,, and, also, the, lobbying, arm, of, NAR., In, 2005,, they, were, considered, the, largest, PAC, in, the, United, States., According, to, realtor.org,, RPAC, is, the, largest, contributor, of, direct, contributions, to, federal, candidates., The, National, Association, of, Exclusive, Buyer, Agents, is, a, group, of, agents, and, brokers, who, work, in, firms, that, represent, buyers, only., They, assist, in, locating, exclusive, buyer, agents, for, home, buyers, through, the, Web, site, www.naeba.org., The, National, Association, of, Real, Estate, Brokers, (NAREB), was, founded, in, 1947, as, an, alternative, for, African, Americans, who, were, excluded, from, the, dominant, NAR., Both, groups, allow, members, to, join, without, regard, to, race., However,, NAREB, has, historically, been, an, African, American-centric, group, with, a, focus, on, developing, housing, resources, for, intercity, populations., Changing, industry[edit], Compensation, is, conventionally, based, on, a, percentage, of, the, sales, price,, split, between, the, buying, and, selling, brokers,, and, then, between, the, agent(s), and, his/her, real, estate, agency., While, a, split, based, on, the, percentage, received, by, the, broker, is, generally, normal,, in, some, brokerages, agents, may, pay, a, monthly, "desk, fee", for, office, costs,, monthly, fee,, etc.,, and, then, retain, 100%, of, the, commission, received.[citation, needed], Economist, Steven, D., Levitt, famously, argued, in, his, 2005, book, Freakonomics, that, real, estate, brokers, have, an, inherent, conflict, of, interest, with, the, sellers, they, represent, because, their, commission, motivates, them, to, sell, quickly, more, than, it, motivates, them, to, sell, at, a, higher, price., Levitt, supported, his, argument, with, a, study, finding, brokers, tend, to, put, their, own, houses, on, the, market, for, longer, and, receive, higher, prices, for, them, compared, to, when, working, for, their, clients., He, concluded, that, broker, commissions, will, reduce, in, future.[16], A, 2008, study, by, other, economists, found, that, when, comparing, brokerage, without, listing, services,, brokerage, actually, significantly, reduces, the, average, sale, price.[17], See, also[edit], Buyer, brokerage,
