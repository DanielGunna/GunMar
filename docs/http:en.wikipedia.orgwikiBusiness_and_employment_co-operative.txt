and, employment, co-operatives, (BECs), represent, a, new, approach, to, providing, support, to, the, creation, of, new, businesses., The, first, BEC, was, started, in, France, in, 1996,, since, then, a, further, 55, such, enterprises, operating, in, 100, locations, across, the, country, has, sprung, up., The, idea, has, also, been, adopted, in, Belgium,, Sweden,, Quebec,, Morocco, and, Madagascar., Like, other, business, creation, support, schemes,, BECs, enable, budding, entrepreneurs, to, experiment, with, their, business, idea, while, benefiting, from, a, secure, income., The, innovation, BECs, introduce, is, that, once, the, business, is, established, the, entrepreneur, is, not, forced, to, leave, and, set, up, independently,, but, can, stay, and, become, a, full, member, of, the, co-operative., The, micro-enterprises, thus, combine, to, form, one, multi-activity, enterprise, whose, members, provide, a, mutually, supportive, environment, for, each, other., A, BEC, thus, provides, budding, business, people, with, an, easy, transition, from, inactivity, to, self-employment,, but, in, a, collective, framework., Intending, entrepreneurs, pass, through, three, stages:, First,, they, remain, technically, unemployed, but, develop, their, business, idea, under, the, wing, of, the, BEC;, Next,, if, it, looks, like, being, a, success,, they, become, a, ‘salaried, entrepreneur’, with, the, security, of, a, part-time, employment, contract;, Finally, they, become, a, self-sufficient, business,, sharing, in, the, ownership, and, management, of, the, co-operative., BECs, allow, a, small, business, person, to, achieve, control, over, their, working, life,, but, with, the, support, of, a, group, of, people, who, are, facing, the, same, problems, and, want, to, pool, their, enthusiasm, and, expertise., They, help, to, overcome, one, of, the, most, discouraging, features, of, becoming, self-employed, –, isolation., They, thus, lower, the, bar, for, becoming, an, entrepreneur,, and, open, up, new, horizons, for, people, who, have, ambition, but, who, lack, the, skills, or, confidence, needed, to, set, off, entirely, on, their, own, –, or, who, simply, want, to, carry, on, an, independent, economic, activity, but, within, a, supportive, group, context., BEC, clients, are, in, all, sorts, of, activities, from, cookery,, industrial, cleaning,, furniture, restoration, and, organic, horticulture, to, violin, making,, jewellery,, translation, and, web, design., At, the, end, of, 2005,, the, 90, sites, in, the, BEC, network, numbered, 2,618, supported, entrepreneurs, plus, 1,138, salaried, entrepreneurs, (including, 60, member, entrepreneurs),, with, a, combined, turnover, of, €16.5, million, in, 2005., Two-thirds, of, entrepreneurs, start, off, as, unemployed,, two-thirds, are, aged, between, 30, and, 50, and, 53%, are, women., Contents, 1, Three-phase, career, 2, Policy, relevance, 3, References, 4, External, links, Three-phase, career[edit], Stage, 1, –, Supported, entrepreneur, Initially,, the, 'candidate, business', works, up, their, idea, while, remaining, legally, unemployed., They, continue, to, receive, unemployment, benefit, while, developing, a, marketable, product, or, service,, testing, the, market, and, establishing, a, client, base., The, BEC, handles, the, business, administration, and, accounting., Stage, 2, -, Salaried, entrepreneur, The, entrepreneur, agrees, to, a, part-time, employment, contract, with, the, BEC,, and, in, return, pays, over, 10%, of, sales., They, continue, to, build, up, the, business, and, receive, training,, administrative, support,, and, social, insurance, coverage., The, salary, grows, as, the, business, grows., Stage, 3, -, Member, entrepreneur, When, the, business, is, self-supporting,, the, entrepreneur, can, choose, to, join, the, BEC, as, a, full, voting, member,, and, take, part, in, its, management,, continuing, to, pay, an, administration, charge, of, 10%, of, sales., Optionally,, the, business, can, spin, off, as, a, totally, independent, entity., Policy, relevance[edit], Business, and, employment, co-operatives, have, aroused, interest, in, various, areas, of, policy-making:, One, of, these, is, economic, development, in, rural, areas,, as, BECs, are, a, good, way, to, support, the, so-called, SOHO-SOLOs,, professionals, who, migrate, to, the, countryside, to, carry, on, their, business, at, a, distance, –, and, in, so, doing, bring, valuable, skills,, economic, activity, and, social, life, back, to, depopulated, areas., Another, is, the, regularisation, of, informal, work., A, third, is, demography,, and, concern, about, how, to, raise, the, activity, rate, to, counter, the, effect, of, an, ageing, population., BECs, can, help, excluded, groups, such, as, ex-offenders, to, restart, their, working, careers,, and, allow, older, people, to, work, part-time., References[edit], Website, of,
