Bros.,, opened, mainstream, Western, audiences, to, the, previously, obscure, martial-arts, film, genre., Martial, arts, film, is, a, film, genre., A, subgenre, of, the, action, film,, martial, arts, films, contain, numerous, martial, arts, fights, between, characters., They, are, usually, the, films', primary, appeal, and, entertainment, value,, and, often, are, a, method, of, storytelling, and, character, expression, and, development., Martial, arts, are, frequently, featured, in, training, scenes, and, other, sequences, in, addition, to, fights., Martial, arts, films, commonly, include, other, types, of, action,, such, as, hand-to-hand, combats,, stuntwork,, chases,, and, gunfights.[1][2][3], Contents, 1, History, 2, Subgenres, 3, See, also, 4, References, 5, External, links, History[edit], As, with, other, action, films,, martial, arts, films, are, dominated, by, action, to, varying, degrees;, many, martial, arts, films, have, only, a, minimal, plot, and, amount, of, character, development, and, focus, almost, exclusively, on, the, action,, while, other, martial, arts, films, have, more, creative, and, complex, plots, and, characters, along, with, action, scenes.[4], Films, of, the, latter, type, are, generally, considered, to, be, artistically, superior, films,, but, many, films, of, the, former, type, are, commercially, successful, and, well, received, by, fans, of, the, genre.[5][6], One, of, the, earliest, Hollywood, movies, to, employ, the, use, of, martial, arts, was, the, 1955, film, Bad, Day, at, Black, Rock.[7][8][9][10], Martial, arts, films, contain, many, characters, who, are, martial, artists,, and, these, roles, are, often, played, by, actors, who, are, real, martial, artists., If, not,, actors, frequently, train, in, preparation, for, their, roles,, or, the, action, director, may, rely, more, on, stylized, action, or, film, making, tricks, like, camera, angles,, editing,, doubles,, undercranking,, wire, work,, and, computer-generated, imagery., Trampolines, and, springboards, can, also, be, used, to, increase, the, height, of, jumps., These, techniques, are, sometimes, used, by, real, martial, artists, as, well,, depending, on, the, style, of, action, in, the, film.[11], During, the, 1970s, and, 1980s,, the, most, visible, presence, of, martial, arts, films, was, the, hundreds, of, English, dubbed, kung, fu, and, ninja, films, produced, by, the, Shaw, Brothers,, Godfrey, Ho,, and, other, Hong, Kong, producers., These, films, were, widely, broadcast, on, North, American, television, on, weekend, timeslots, that, were, often, colloquially, known, as, Kung, Fu, Theater,, Black, Belt, Theater,, or, variations, thereof., Inclusive, in, this, list, of, films, are, commercial, classics, like, The, Big, Boss,, Drunken, Master,, and, One, Armed, Boxer., Martial, arts, films, have, been, produced, all, over, the, world,, but, the, genre, has, been, dominated, by, Hong, Kong, action, cinema,, peaking, from, 1971, with, the, rise, of, Bruce, Lee, until, the, mid-1990s, with, a, general, decline, in, the, industry.[12], Other, notable, figures, in, the, genre, include, Jackie, Chan,, Jet, Li,, Sammo, Hung,, Yuen, Biao,, and, Donnie, Yen., Sonny, Chiba, has, appeared, with, karate, and, jidaigeki, from, Japan, of, the, 1970s., Hollywood, has, also, participated, in, the, genre, with, actors, such, as, Chuck, Norris,, Jean-Claude, Van, Damme,, Steven, Seagal,, Brandon, Lee, (son, of, Bruce, Lee),, Wesley, Snipes,, Gary, Daniels,, Mark, Dacascos,, and, Jason, Statham.[13], In, the, 2000s,, Thailand's, film, industry, became, an, international, force, in, the, genre, with, the, films, of, Tony, Jaa,[14], and, the, Cinema, of, Vietnam, followed, suit, with, The, Rebel, and, Clash., In, more, recent, years,, the, Indonesian, film, industry, has, offered, Merantau, (2009)[15][16][17], and, The, Raid:, Redemption, (2011)., Women, have, also, played, key, roles, in, the, genre,, including, such, actresses, as, Michelle, Yeoh,, Angela, Mao,, and, Cynthia, Rothrock.[18][19][20], In, addition,, western, animation, has, ventured, into, the, genre, with, the, most, successful, effort, being, the, internationally, hailed, DreamWorks, Animation, film, franchise,, Kung, Fu, Panda,, starring, Jack, Black, and, Angelina, Jolie., Subgenres[edit], Kung, fu, films, are, a, significant, movie, genre, in, themselves., Like, westerns, for, Americans,, they, have, become, an, identity, of, Chinese, cinema., As, the, most, prestigious, movie, type, in, Chinese, film, history,, kung, fu, movies, were, among, the, first, Chinese, films, produced, and, the, wuxia, period, films, (武俠片), are, the, original, form, of, Chinese, kung, fu, films., The, wuxia, period, films, came, into, vogue, due, to, the, thousands, of, years, popularity, of, wuxia, novels, (武俠小說)., For, example,, the, wuxia, novels, of, Jin, Yong[21], and, Gu, Long[22], directly, led, to, the, prevalence, of, wuxia, period, films., Outside, of, the, Chinese, speaking, world, the, most, famous, wuxia, film, made, was, the, Ang, Lee, film, Crouching, Tiger,, Hidden, Dragon,, which, was, based, on, the, Wang, Dulu, series, of, wuxia, novels:, it, earned, four, Academy, Awards,, including, one, for, Best, Foreign, Film., In, the, Chinese-speaking, world,, martial, arts, films, are, commonly, divided, into, two, subcategories:, the, wuxia, period, films, (武俠片),, and, the, more, modern, Kung, fu, films, (功夫片,, best, epitomized, in, the, films, of, Bruce, Lee).[23], In, the, Chinese-speaking, world,, martial, arts, films, commonly, refer, to, a, genre, wuxia, which, presents, historical, background,, usually, in, ancient, dynasties,, there, lives, a, common, person,, usually, poor, and, without, social, status,, but, possessing, a, kind, heart, and, would, like, to, help, people, and, fight, for, justice,, so, the, character, develops, though, the, plot, fighting, against, the, bad, ones, who, hold, the, power, and, finally, achieves, the, peace, and, justice, for, people, and, becomes, a, master, of, martial, arts., Martial, arts, westerns, are, usually, American, films, inexpensively, filmed, in, Southwestern, United, States, locations,, transposing, martial, arts, themes, into, an, "old, west", setting;, e.g.,, Red, Sun, with, Charles, Bronson, and,
